""But I don't. My golf activity has been very limited. I can chip and putt really well. And hit short irons very well. But I haven't hit any long stuff seriously.""The 46-year-old, who had previously said amputation was ""on the table"" following the crash, described his right leg as ""altered ... (it) does not look like my left, put it that way.""""My foot was a little messed up there about a year ago,"" he said. ""The walking part is something that I'm still working on, working on strength and development in that. It takes time.""""What's frustrating is it's not at my timetable,"" Woods added. ""I want to be at a certain place, but I'm not. I've just got to continue working. I'm getting better, yes, but as I said, not at the speed and rate that I would like. You add in the age factor, too. You just don't quite heal as fast, which is frustrating.""Read MoreAt the press conference, Woods spoke of his intention to return to competitive golf while again conceding he won't be able to play a full tour schedule. ""That will never happen again,"" he said. ""I can play certain events here and there, but on a full-time level, no, that will never happen again.""Tiger Woods and son Charlie Woods fist bump during the pro-am ahead of the PNC Championship on December 17, 2021.Woods' only foray into competitive golf since the crash was in December 2021 alongside son Charlie at the PNC Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club Orlando, Grande Lakes in Florida, and said he was ""a lot stronger"" now than then.The appearance gave him hope, Woods added, that he'd be able to play with his son again in the future. ""I wouldn't trade those experiences in for anything. We had two of the greatest days ever together, just he and I,"" he said.Like at the PNC Championship, Woods said he is still using a cart to negotiate golf courses rather than walking, also alluding to back issues which existed before his crash. Woods, a five-time Masters winner, would not say if he was planning to compete at the Masters' Par-3 contest scheduled for April at the Augusta National Golf Club.""I can do that now,"" he said. ""But whether or not I do that... I don't know yet."""

The Mexican player explained how he came to the decision that a nine-iron would be the perfect club for his tee shot, and it proved a smart decision as his ball trickled into the hole from 178 yards.Coming on the par-three 16th hole, which is famous for its electric atmosphere due to the stadium-like seating, Ortiz's ace sparked raucous celebrations. A general view of the 16th hole during the third round of the Phoenix Open.Ortiz high-fived his playing partner Kevin Kisner and his caddie as the surrounding crowd showered the players and everyone else in beer and cans. And while the atmosphere was boisterous, Ortiz says one of those stray cans thrown in celebration happened to strike him. Read More""It was unbelievable. I didn't know how to react,"" Ortiz told reporters as he reflected on hitting the 11th all-time hole-in-one on the 16th at the Phoenix Open. ""A lot of people cheering for you and then you start trying to watch out for your head because I got actually nailed pretty hard on the back with a beer can, and then after that I was just trying to just avoid all the cans I could,"" added Ortiz, who then eagled the 17th.The 30-year-old golfer said it was the first time in his professional career he had hit an ace and then an eagle on successive holes.Ortiz described the ""vibe"" on the 16th, 17th and 18th holes as ""unbelievable"" and ""unique,"" but he wouldn't want to play in that atmosphere every week. ""It would be tiring,"" Ortiz told reporters. ""Especially once they get drunk they get a little rowdy and start saying the wrong things.""Ortiz hits his second shot on the second hole during the third round of the Phoenix Open.Raining holes-in-oneThe announcer on the TV coverage of the Phoenix Open said after Ortiz's ball rolled in: ""It's raining in the desert again!""CNN has reached out to the PGA Tour to ask for comment on the issue and to ask what steps does it plan to take -- if any -- to prevent this happening at future events.

As much as 92-feet from the hole, off the front of the green and a shot behind leader Bubba Watson, it looked like Harold Varner III's opportunity to win had slipped away. A par would mean Watson wins. A birdie would take it to a playoff. An eagle, while improbable, would give Varner the win. With his trusty putter in hand, Varner went to work as if he was a magician. The US golfer's winding, weaving putt traversed the immaculate green, before slowly dropping into the hole and sparking scenes of jubilant celebration.

""A guy I truly love,"" Watson said of Varner, describing him as a ""dear friend.""""A guy that I want to help,"" continued Watson. ""He's new -- when I say new, we know Harold, but it took me -- it was five years until I won my first. ""So, this is a guy that's just starting to play better and better each year. We see his name a little bit more. He's getting comfortable.""The two-time Masters winner added: ""I'm not mad at him for beating me. I'm happy for him ... I applaud him. I love seeing that.

The three-time major winner took those recovery skills to another level at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in Saturday's third round in what proved to be a bit of a cliffhanger.After his drive on the par-four eighth hole landed precariously near the edge of a cliff, rather than taking a drop to move his ball -- that would have cost a shot -- Spieth decided to take it on. Harold Varner III sinks monster eagle putt on final hole to win the 2022 Saudi InternationalHe addressed and readdressed the ball a few times, adjusting his footing to ensure his stance was stable. And despite the almost 70-foot drop just inches in front of him, Spieth connected cleanly with the ball, quickly moving himself back from the edge of the cliff as soon as he'd made contact. Read MoreAfter playing the shot, Spieth could be heard on TV cameras saying to his caddie Michael Greller: ""That was by far the most nerve-wracking shot I've ever hit in my life."" 'Awfully close'Perhaps understandably Spieth was still talking about that cliffhanger moment after he'd finished his round.""I'm glad I finished the round and didn't fall off that cliff on eight,"" Spieth said in an interview with CBS.""It was by far the most nerve-wracking shot I've ever hit. Like Michael (Greller) said afterwards: 'I should have grabbed the ball and thrown it in the water' because he was trying to get me not to hit it. I was like: 'Michael, please don't walk up there' because then he would've seen definitely not to hit it. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos""It was awfully close. I've never had a life and death situation on a shot before. So I thought I wouldn't really have nerves the rest of the day after that one.""Remarkably, Spieth was able to salvage a par from the hole, with the perilous shot landing just over the green. From there, he was able to chip onto the green and roll home a 10-foot par for par. Spieth is known for taking on shots from awkward lies. A clip of him hitting an almost vertical shot at the Ryder Cup last year -- after which, he almost ran into Lake Michigan -- went viral. "

Between a smiley disposition and his 'business at the front, party at the back' haircut, Smith has become somewhat of a fan favorite. Meanwhile over the last two years, the 28-year-old Smith has also blossomed into a serial contender or winner. He began 2022 in red-hot fashion, winning the Tournament of Champions in historic fashion earlier in January, posting the lowest under-par score in a four-round PGA Tour event in history to hold off world No. 1 Jon Rahm. Read MoreAfterwards, he was asked in his press conference why his personality hasn't changed over the years, especially in light of his recent success in golf. The reporter described his personality as ""everyman if you will, for the Americans, or just the solid true-blue bloke that you've been able to maintain.""And his response was reassuringly ""everyman."" ""There's no real reason to change my personality,"" Smith said. ""I think my dad would whip me to be honest if I did. ""I don't know, it's just how I've been brought up. I've been brought up to be the modest guy that respects everyone and like even out there today, Johnny was great as well. ""Every time we made a putt or a birdie, it was: 'Good shot, mate' or there was never any hatred towards each other just because we were competing. ""We wanted to win because we wanted to compete against the best. So yeah, I think that's just how I've been brought up and I respect other guy's good play as well.""While acknowledging that it's ""great that people get behind"" his look, Smith would ultimately prefer them to be talking about his success on the course. Smith is shown during second round play in the Tour Championship in 2021.WinningSince winning his first PGA Tour event in May 2017 at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans -- partnered with Jonas Blixt -- Smith has become one of the steadiest players in golf. He then won back-to-back Australian PGA Championships in 2017 and 2018 on the European Tour. It's over the last two years that Smith has really gone to the next level. A playoff victory at the Sony Open in January 2020 was his first individual victory on the PGA Tour before he achieved his best finish at a major to date, finishing tied for second behind Dustin Johnson at the Masters in 2020. Smith also became the first golfer in Masters history to shoot all four rounds in the 60s.He once again won the Zurich Classic of New Orleans in 2021, this time partnered with countryman Marc Leishman, while Smith finished tied for 10th competing at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. After hitting his straps towards the end of the 2020-21 PGA Tour season, Smith began the new year in the perfect fashion with his record-breaking win in Maui, something he attributes to an improvement in his driving. Smith carries his own golf bag as his caddie cleans the fairway bunker on the second hole during the third round of the Masters in 2021.He says he spent time on the driving range during the offseason practicing with his driver.When asked about what he worked on to improve his driving, Smith said: ""It really wasn't much. Probably just hitting more balls with a driver to be honest.""I'm not lazy. Actually, I guess I'm lazy on the range. I get through the wedges and the irons and I'm like: 'I'm ready to go home now.' I barely hit drivers. So I made sure I stayed there for an extra 10-15 minutes and actually hit some balls."" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosThe result has been Smith's meteoric rise up the world rankings and into the top 10 for the first time in his career. One of his goals for the rest of the year is qualify and lead the International President Cup Team which will face the US team at Quail Hollow in September. ""I definitely want to be on that team,"" Smith said. ""I enjoyed the tournament so much last time that I would be devastated if I missed out. And it's been one of my goals since I've turned pro to be on the team, and I'll try and be there again."" "

The Kiwi player has won two majors, as well as becoming the youngest player ever to win a professional golf tour event aged just 14. In 2015, when she was just 17 years, nine months and nine days of age, Ko also became the youngest men's or women's player to be ranked world No. 1 in professional golf.If winning tournaments or setting records provides a buzz, it is not the be-all and end-all for Ko, a message that is reinforrced by her coach Sean Foley: ""Just because you win another event, yes, you'll be happy for that day, but it doesn't make you a better person or worse person the day after."" ""Sometimes for me, I identify myself with just the way I played that day,"" Ko told CNN Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue. ""And sometimes if I don't play well I go: 'Oh man, you're so stupid,' or things like that.

And my goal is to hopefully have the career grand slam, I've been close in the three majors that I haven't won yet.

As well as her record-breaking victory at the New South Wales Women's Open in 2012 aged 14, she became the youngest winner of a Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour event in the same year.When she was 17, she set an LPGA record for most money earned by a rookie, raking in $2,089,033. In 2015, Ko became the youngest player in the ""modern era"" (post-1900) of either gender to win a major championship, winning the Evian Championship as an 18-year-old.Ko poses with the trophy after winning  LPGA Taiwan Championship on October 25, 2015.However, after winning the Mediheal Championship in 2018, her fortunes changed. For the first time in her young career, Ko endured a barren spell, entering 37 events between 2019 and 2020, failing to win one and finishing in the top 10 just eight times. Ko remembers when she was struggling for form and was searching for her ""consistency,"" adding that she was ""definitely overthinking and trying to overanalyze.""""I think before I used to not be that type of person and when you're struggling, you're trying to find answers and trying to dig deeper and deeper and deeper,"" the 24-year-old said.

The victory at the event, which boasts one of the richest prizes on the Ladies European Tour (LET) schedule -- a $1 million prize fund -- moves her up to fifth in the world rankings and cements herself as one of the form players in world golf. Despite the early career success, Ko believes the 2021 season is her ""most consistent"" ever. Ko says her consistency this year can be partly explained by the lessons she learned when her form dipped.

Opening originally as a nine-hole course in 2011 before expanding to 12, Brautarholt was designed by renowned Icelandic architect Edwin Roald. Roald has attracted plenty of attention in recent years with his ""why 18-holes?"" movement, a philosophy that suggests golf course design would be improved if architects worked to create the best course for the space they have, rather than cling onto the ""antiquated"" notion that every course must be 18-holes long.JUST WATCHEDGolf in the land of fire and iceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGolf in the land of fire and ice 03:13""When you have limited resources, you are forced to use what nature has given you,"" Roald told Links magazine in 2017.

Imagine if all books had to be exactly 200 pages, or a film had to last 95 minutes. Would they be as good?""Despite comprising of only 12 holes, Brautarholt has been internationally recognized as one of the world's finest courses. In 2020, it was ranked No. 64 in a list of the World's Top-100 courses by Golfscape, alongside the likes of Pebble Beach and St. Andrews.A blueprint?

The women's team also qualified for three consecutive European championships from 2009 to 2017 having never previously qualified for a major tournament.Much of the national team's remarkable success has been attributed to the country's investment in state of the art, indoor facilities and excellent coaching, a blueprint that may end up being replicated in golf.

Ulfar Jonsson is GKG's Sporting Director and has seen firsthand the impact the facility has made. ""We see our younger players are getting technically more advanced and better. So we're seeing better swings.""We encourage obviously all our players to play as much as they can out on the course over the summertime, but then they can come in here and work on the technique during the winter."" Having had limited success on the world's biggest tours, Haukur Orn Birgisson -- the president of the Icelandic Golf Union and the European Golf Association -- believes that the investment in facilities like the one at GKG could lead to results for Icelandic players at the highest level.""When you think about it, we have a golfing season that spans for about five, six months. So having indoor practice facilities means a lot and with new technology, these facilities have become so advanced. GKG is a perfect example of that. So now you have club members playing golf in wintertime, albeit indoors and in simulators, but it's important for their development. ""It's important for the junior development as well. You can look at football, for example. Fifteen years ago, they started having these indoor football facilities and a few years later, our national teams qualified for the European Championship and the World Cup. So there you go, it's important,"" he says. The facility at GKG has also provided a valuable social element to the club. ""Now, we have an all-year facility -- before, it was mainly a summer sport ... Now, all the golfers come in and they're playing with their friends in the simulators, enjoying a meal and a drink afterwards. So it's been fantastic for the morale of the club,"" Jonsson explains. A simulator is used at the indoor facility at GKG. SustainabilityAs well as being acknowledged as one of the finest courses to play, Brautarholt is also looking to become the most sustainable golf course on the planet. ""Here in Iceland, more or less all of our energy is renewable, so we thought it would be a good idea to move in that direction here,"" Palsson explains. Having embraced hydro and geothermal energy, nearly 100% of Iceland's electricity comes from renewable sources. Looking to take advantage of the country's clean energy, Palsson has invested in a fleet of 30 automated electric mowers.READ: The world is banking on giant carbon-sucking fans to clean our climate mess. It's a big risk.""We're at a point now where mowers running on electricity take care of approximately 98% of the golf course,"" Palsson says.Managing the fleet of small, orange mowers is the job of course manager and head green keeper Einar Jonasson. ""Yes, our little friends. They are just a different way of thinking of cutting the grass."" An electric mower used in Iceland's Brautarholt golf course. With a series of cables laid out around the course, the mowers are programmed to stay on the fairways and can be in action around the clock. As well as providing an environmental benefit, they have also allowed Jonasson to concentrate on other elements of course maintenance. In addition to a carbon footprint that is close to zero, Brautarholt is also maintained without the use of chemicals and with Iceland's year-round rainfall, there is little need for any irrigation. ""Our golf course is in a spectacular location and visitors come here to enjoy that nature. We don't want to harm the environment in the anyway possible, so we don't care if you see any weeds in the fairway, we don't want to harm anything,"" Jonasson explains.Having recently invested in a state of the art, electric, ride-on-mower for tees and greens, Brautarholt is looking to set a new, sustainable standard for golf course management.""I think we are the greenest golf course in the world,"" Palsson says with pride.  One of a kindDespite Iceland's population of less than 400,000, the country is home to a remarkable 65 golf courses -- and among them are some of the most spectacular courses you're likely to find anywhere in the world. ""I would encourage everyone to come to play here,"" says Birgisson.  ""The nature here is second to none ... When you play golf in Iceland, you get to experience that nature as well. You can play golf in lava fields, you can play golf in volcanic craters, on the banks of glacier rivers, with hot springs blowing up like Geysir right next to you with water hazards that are made out of boiling water. You can't get closer to nature while playing golf."" With the country situated almost equidistant to the US and Europe, is there any chance of one of golf's major tours taking a tournament to Iceland in the future?""One day, it could be possible. Imagine a PGA Tour event being played in the midnight sun that we have here in June and July, it would be fantastic,"" says Birgisson. Bright futureGiven the standard of the courses in Iceland, it's little wonder that golf has experienced huge growth in the country and now ranks as one of the most popular sports. ""Golf has risen enormously over the past 10-15 years, and we've actually almost tripled our numbers in the past two decades,"" says Birgisson, ""But the last two years have been explosive and now we have over 6% of the entire population that are actually members of a golf club.""But at the same time, we have probably about 40,000 that actually play golf. So 12% of the population plays golf and that I think that's -- that must be a world record.""Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos""It's also worth mentioning that the level of female participation has arisen from 10% to 33% in that time,"" he adds.With participation continuing to grow and innovative new courses and facilities, Iceland is quickly becoming one of the most exciting golfing destinations in the world. With momentum on his side, Birgisson is confident that things are just getting started.""We couldn't be happier, it's safe to say that the future of Icelandic golf is looking very bright."""

""The Golden Bear,"" ""The King"" and ""The Black Knight"" shared 34 major wins between them and irrevocably changed the sport they played.Through a combination of Arnold Palmer's ""swashbuckling"" style of play, Gary Player's sheer willpower and Jack Nicklaus' utter brilliance, this triumvirate of golf greats catapulted the game into the modern era. If the trio came to redefine how golf was played between the late 1950s and the early 1980s, unusually for sporting rivals, they also formed lasting relationships along the way -- so much so that the wives of Nicklaus and Palmer were best friends too. ""We were a big three in friendship, like brothers,"" the 85-year-old Player told CNN's Living Golf. ""We traveled to China, we'd travel to South Africa, all over Europe. ""We went all over the world, Australia, everywhere together. And we basically lived together, playing a lot of television matches and exhibitions together.""Read MorePlayer remembers having a confrontation with Palmer on one of his courses, but the ""affection"" they had for each other made it easier to reconcile. ""We went in and we had lunch together and I can vividly remember, we were both crying because I think we had such affection for each other that we didn't want it to have an effect on our friendship. And so we laughed together as well as crying together.""JUST WATCHEDHow Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus revolutionized golfReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus revolutionized golf 07:28'That man's going to be a champion'Palmer was the first of the trio to attain golf superstar status. Even the great Nicklaus, the man who has won the most majors in a professional golf career, admitted that he was part of ""Arnie's army"" during his early years. Nicklaus remembers putting a driving clinic on in Athens, Ohio as an 18-year-old with Palmer and outdriving his rival by 40 yards.Nicklaus remembers saying to Palmer: ""I just knocked it by you 40 yards."" Palmer replied: ""Yeah, but I shot 63 and you shot 67.""South African Player recalls seeing Palmer hitting balls on a practice tee in 1957 and thinking: ""Well, that man's going to be a champion.""Player's prediction was prescient. A year later Palmer won his first major title, claiming the famous Green Jacket as a 28-year-old. He was to don the Masters' Green Jacket three more times, as well as winning the US Open in 1960 and the Open Championship twice. Assisted by his agent Mark McCormack -- who would eventually represent both Nicklaus and Player -- Palmer became a global superstar, traveling around the world to showcase his skills with his clubs and aided by the charisma he ""oozed,"" according to the South African golf legend. Palmer smiles during the presentation ceremony at the 1958 Masters tournament.His passion for the game was prodigious, according to Player.""Even as he got older, he really couldn't break 90, but he still wanted to go out there and play with the members and with people,"" Player said.Palmer's rise to prominence was accompanied by the advent of widespread television across the US allowing people across the country to watch him win his maiden majors. ""They loved the common man who rose to the top and slew all the dragons,"" Nicklaus explained. But it was Palmer's style of play on the course which really made him such a likeable player to spectators. The 18-time major winner Nicklaus calls him a ""Robin Hood"" of sorts. ""He seemed like he wanted to hit it into the woods, so he could hit a spectacular shot out and thrill everybody,"" he said. ""And he did that. He hit it in the woods a lot, and he had these spectacular shots that everybody related to. ""And he excited everybody. He hitched up his pants and had a cigarette hanging out of his mouth.""Palmer plays a shot from the bunker at the seventh hole at the Desert Inn Country Club.CompetitivenessThe competitive nature of golf's self-professed ""Big Three"" drove them onto bigger and better things.Nicklaus and Palmer often played themselves out of contention for tournaments, such was the competitive fire between the two, according to the 18-time major winner.Nicklaus especially remembers the 1975 Masters, in which they were both near the top of the leaderboard after two rounds. ""We were playing the third round and I shot 73 and Arnold shot 75. And we shook hands on the last hole and he says: 'We did it again. Here we are shooting ourselves out of the tournament.' ""I came back, shot a good last round and ended up winning the tournament. But Arnold effectively shot himself out of the tournament. And that's not the way to play golf. ""You play golf by controlling yourself. And you're the only person who you can control, not the field. So you have to take that into consideration, but we didn't. We were too stubborn. We were too competitive.""Including his 18 majors, Nicklaus won 73 PGA Tour victories -- the third most ever. Palmer collected 62 PGA Tour victories, the fifth most ever. Player had 24 PGA Tour victories, while also racking up a remarkable 116 international wins. Player draws similarities between the trio's passion and drive and the competitive spirit that Tiger Woods -- the 15-time major winner and tied for the most ever PGA Tour victories -- brings to the game. ""We were as fierce as competitors that the world has ever seen,"" says Player.""But the thing is we had great affection for each other. When we were on the golf course and we made it very clear: 'I want to beat you. And if you beat me, I'll look you in the eye and say well done.'""Palmer and Player follow the flight of Nicklaus' tee shot at the Firestone Country Club, Akron, Ohio in 1965.Changing opinionsWhile the Open Championship is one of the most sought-after accolades in golf globally, that wasn't always the case. Player had won the major in 1959, but before Palmer made his first appearance there a year later, very few American golfers had made the journey over to the UK to participate in the tournament.Arriving as the reigning Masters and US Open champion, Palmer brought a certain level of cachet to his compatriots watching back home on his way to a second place finish, according to Nicklaus. ""The Scots loved him. And playing at St. Andrew's and Kel Nagle beats him by a shot. And all of a sudden, all American players wanted to go to the British Open,"" said Nicklaus.Nicklaus, Palmer and Player are pictured at the Open Championship in 1970 at St. Andrew's.Fast forward to the 149th Open at Royal St. George's in July and 51 US golfers featured in the 156 strong field, including eventual winner Collin Morikawa. Although Player says the Open ""would be what it is today without"" Palmer's influence, he does believe that the American's arrival at the event helped bring extra eyeballs to it back in the US.""The Open Championship with Ben Hogan and Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen and Peter Thomson and Roberto De Vicenzo and you can go down the list of hundreds of guys that helped make the Open, this great championship. ""Did Arnold Palmer enhance it when he came across? Yes. Here was this charismatic man playing so well in America, comes across, certainly, it did the Open an immense amount of good, but we can never give one man the credit for the greatest championship in the world.""Palmer, Player and Nicklaus pose with their golf clubs before a practice round at the Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio.Since his death in 2016, Palmer has been honored throughout the game of golf and the even by the US Postal Service -- they issued a commemorative stamp honoring the golfing great in 2020.""I think most of the guys realized what Arnold did for the game was more than anybody else,"" said Nicklaus, as he paid tribute to his ""hero.""Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos""His influence in the game, his demeanor, the way he handled himself, he needed to be stately when he needed to be stately, presidential when he needed to be presidential, humble when he needed to be humble.

It's been five years, but I miss my buddy.Nicklaus looks up to the sky to honor Palmer before hitting an honorary first tee shot for the ceremonial start of the first round of the Masters in 2017.""I talked to him about two weeks before he passed. And he was his typical self. I said: 'How's it going, AP?' He said: 'I think I'm getting ready to go out and hit some balls. I'm really feeling good. As best as I've felt in a long time, I'm looking forward to getting out there.' ""He wasn't anymore near getting ready to go hit golf balls than a man on the moon, but he didn't want me to know anything different. So I gave him credit for that, and for that, I love him.

He repeated himself,"" adds O'Connor, describing Norman's speech mannerisms. ""He had this sort of sing-songy lilt to his voice and his eyes would kind of go all over the place.""But like Babbitt, Norman's unusual personality was accompanied by a touch of genius -- such was his golf skill it earned him the self-proclaimed title of ""the best ball striker who ever lived."" In an age when golfing legends like Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Lee Trevino regularly swept up major titles, Norman only appeared in the Masters twice, but his accuracy still attracted the respect of many of his fellow players, and has earned him cult status.Read MoreThrough his highly distinctive ""single plane swing"" -- which he created, practiced and perfected himself and which current players, such as U.S. Open winner Bryson DeChambeau, have now taken elements from -- Norman was able to repeatedly hit the same spot on the fairway or green with unerring regularity. Despite that, the Canadian isn't a household name.Whether it was shyness around newcomers, his ""eccentric"" personality or the fact he never enjoyed the same success on the PGA Tour as his contemporaries, those who knew him say Norman often just didn't fit in.""We live in this culture in which we celebrate celebrity and those who achieved at the highest level. Moe did not do that,"" O'Connor -- author of ""The Feeling of Greatness: The Moe Norman Story"" -- told CNN Sport. ""Moe was just this beautiful character.

Different from the outset Born in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, in 1929, as a child Norman enjoyed spending his days with friends or playing hockey. However, once he discovered golf, his life began to change, but at some cost O'Connor says.As Norman's interest in golf blossomed, fueled further by regularly caddying at a local club, his working-class family questioned why he chose to play a sport often associated with the more elite members of society. Despite Norman's ever-increasing passion for the game, his family ""totally rejected it,"" resulting in Norman's ignoring their support when they eventually came to watch him years later, according to O'Connor. ""His family was opposed to this thing that he loved,"" O'Connor explained. ""And it really caused the schism in the family and really total estrangement.""During his late teens and early twenties, Norman dedicated himself to perfecting his ""single plane swing,"" so that he could routinely hit the ball wherever he wanted with remarkable accuracy.The ""single plane swing"" was Norman's attempt to improve shot efficiency and remove the number of variables involved. Addressing the ball, Norman ensured the club's shaft position was maintained at impact and he did so by using a wide stance, outstretched pose and aligned hands. It was a swing that synchronized the movements of the hips, shoulders, arms and hands. Norman at Oakdale Golf Club in 1977. Such was his dedication to perfecting his swing, there are stories of Norman spending so much time on the practice range that by the time he left, his palms were bloody from the repetition of his practice.Later in his career, Norman would run clinics for fans, during which he would showcase his accuracy. He'd even attract the attention of fellow professionals, such was his precision. Yet for Norman, winning tournaments wasn't the end goal. The process of clean ball striking was more ""spiritual"" for him -- something he described to O'Connor as being the ""the feeling of greatness.""Professional Todd Graves spent a year trying to learn Norman's swing from a video tape given to him by a friend; but he says his first experience of seeing the Canadian hitting balls close up still blew him away.""I don't think I've ever seen anybody do what Moe could do to a golf ball, as far as the consistency of the flight, the windows he would hit the golf ball and with just such simplicity,"" Graves -- co-founder of 'Graves Golf Academy' -- told CNN Sport.

Given these personality traits, O'Connor says some people have subsequently hypothesized that Norman might have been on the autism spectrum. Included on the list of symptoms for autism by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are avoiding eye contact and wanting to be alone, repeating or echoing words or phrases or repeating ""words or phrases in place of normal language,"" and not being able to relate to others or ""not have an interest in other people at all."" Every one of these symptoms, in retrospect, could have applied to Norman. Norman with tour players, at the Telus Skins Game at the National Golf Club of Canada in 1995. However, in researching his book, O'Connor uncovered another possible theory to explain Norman's personality traits. When Norman was about five years old, he was out sledding with a friend and, as they slid across a road, he was hit in the forehead by the tire of a reversing car, according to O'Connor.Because there were no broken bones, his family didn't take him to the hospital and the neuroscientists O'Connor interviewed theorized that Norman's different personality might have been due to a frontal lobe brain injury. ""He knew what was important in life. He was just unable to express it in ways that a lot of people would. He didn't get jokes at all. And he just lived within this very confined area of golf and came off as a strange character to a lot of people,"" said O'Connor.

Feeling at homeOn a golf course, however, Norman was in his element.O'Connor recalls stories of Norman chatting easily with spectators during rounds and even taking bets from onlookers about whether he could bounce a ball off his driver more than 100 times or hit a ball into their shirt pockets. Graves, who is also the executive producer of an upcoming documentary on Norman, remembers speaking to former PGA of Canada professional Henry Brunton about the change in Norman's demeanor on and off the course.While Brunton describes Norman as being ""supremely confident"" with a club in his hand, when faced with just his fellow players in the clubhouse, he was ""like a 12-year-old kid.""""He was intimidated. He didn't understand how to act around other players. He was so intimidated by his peers,"" Brunton told Graves.Although he enjoyed great success in his native Canada, Norman struggled on the bigger stage of the US PGA Tour. While he racked up over 60 wins on the Canadian Tour, Norman played in 27 events on the PGA Tour across 15 years, finishing in the top 10 only once, earning just $7,139.He also played in five Senior PGA Tour events, in which he earned $22,900 in prize money. He only appeared twice in the four majors, playing in the Masters in 1956 and 1957. According to Graves, adjusting to life on the road in a new country and without the familiarity of his support system proved tough for Norman.He also had to endure at least one alleged incident of bullying from unnamed fellow professionals. In just his second year on the Tour, he was cornered by two players in the midst of a tournament -- in which Norman was in contention -- and told: ""You got to stop fooling around, take a caddy, stop with the big tees,"" according to O'Connor.The PGA of America -- which ran the tour before the modern day PGA Tour was established in 1968 -- have not responded to CNN's request for comment.

According to Golf Digest in 1995, the golfer was living in a $400-a-month motel room and kept his clothes in his car. Later in life, golf manufacturer Titleist paid Norman $5,000 a month for the rest of his life due to his service to the sport. Just a few years later, in 2004, Moe Norman died at the age of 75.

Struggling with your game? Try carrying an unborn child while you plot your way around the course.Twenty years ago, this is exactly what amateur Brenda Corrie-Kuehn -- eight months pregnant -- did at the US Women's Open at Pine Needles Lodge & Golf Club alongside playing partner Jennifer Greggain, who was well into her second trimester.Their scores were not the best and they were not the quickest around the course -- they were even put on the clock by officials given the number of toilet ""pit stop"" breaks Corrie-Kuehn had to quite naturally make.Yet the mother-of-three finished with a birdie and defied her obstetrician-gynecologist, who thought she was too close to the due date to be on a golf course in 80-degree heat.""I said to her: 'Over my dead body.' I qualified for this, I worked hard to get there, I am going to play,"" Corrie-Kuehn told CNN Sport.Read MoreA week later, daughter Rachel was born, and her 56-year-old mom will have inspired others to carry on living life when your tummy and your doctors are telling you no.Corrie-Kuehn tees off during the first round of the 56th U.S. Women's Open Championship at Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club in Southern Pines, North Carolina, on Thursday, May 31, 2001.""It was not pretty. I don't remember what I did, but there's a point towards the end of your pregnancy where you just get big very quickly,"" said the nine-time US Open veteran.""I think that happened between the time of qualifying for the Open and the actual event itself, and it's hard to fire the hips with the added weight, so my swing changed and I couldn't hit it very far. But I was glad to be there.""A lot of people asked me: 'How could you play that way?' What I was trying to show was it's part of life. I had some physical restrictions and after the US Open I played in a cart at home before Rachel was born.""What I was trying to show was just because you're pregnant, and unless you have a medical condition, you can do the same things you did before you were pregnant and after you deliver. That was my message.""With such golfing genes -- Corrie-Kuehn's mother was a Venezuelan national champion and so was her dad -- it's little wonder Rachel followed in her mom's footsteps to the renowned Wake Forest University in North Carolina where she also excels at golf, narrowly missing out on the Augusta National Women's Amateur finale at Augusta earlier this year.She has the most avid supporter in her mom, whose advice for any pregnant golfer is to watch how long you spend practicing on the greens.""It affected my distance a lot. Imagine having a 30-pound ball in front of you and trying to fire your hips, you would lose your balance. So my swing became very armsy and rhythmical.""But there's no reason for the short game not to be good -- although you cannot sit and practice your putting for a long time because your back kills you.""READ: Patty Tavatanakit: The golfer who admits it's 'odd' to think she's a major winnerStrong momsThree-time major champion Nancy Lopez has three daughters and won events while pregnant in the 1980s and 1990s.

I promised him if I felt anything uncomfortable, I would stop competing,"" said the 37-year-old, who hit 80 balls at full tilt that day and whose longest drive is 401 yards, five shy of the world record.Now expecting her second daughter, due in September, Carlborg has used the Covid-19 lockdowns to start a podcast called PowerMamas in Sweden to help empower new mothers.Carlborg is pictured playing on the World Long Drive Championship in 2016.""I'm getting weaker and weaker again so I'm really looking forward to coming back as a strong athlete for next year. My goal is to be my strongest me -- stronger than I've ever been and swing it faster than I ever have.""Many people say women are stronger after they've been a mom.""Carlborg gets some of her positive outlook from the way her sponsors initially took the news she was having her first baby.""It's a big difference nowadays. I was very nervous when I told my sponsors I was pregnant with Ebba, wondering what they were going to say, but I think that's been a big change in the past few years, in all sports.""I'm happy that we live not like 10-15 years ago, people always used to say: 'When you have kids. you're out of your sport.'  I hope more ladies are thinking that having kids won't stop them from being a high-level athlete.""Former Great Britain rower Baz Moffat founded the Well HQ earlier in 2021 with two doctors -- one of whom, Dr Emma Ross, has written a chapter on women and pregnancies in golf as part of a female athlete health book.""Pregnancy and post-natal recovery in sport is a really, really new thing. Brenda is a real one-off,"" Moffat told CNN.""It's only really since Serena Williams in 2014 that this has become more of a thing, in terms of more women sandwiching in children within their careers -- as opposed to just pushing their careers right up until the point they want to have children and that being the number one reason they retire from sport.""Mother-of-two Moffat, who trained with the Great Britain Olympic team between 2004-08, said the change has been massive from her day as an elite athlete post the Beijing Games.""I don't think there were any moms in the world of international sport back then.

When he politely asked again after participating in events solely for Black players, he was on the receiving end of racist abuse or even death threats. But Sifford did not give up.With the backing of California attorney general Stanley Mosk and with fellow trailblazer Jackie Robinson by his side, Sifford became the first Black player to play on the PGA Tour in 1959.And if you visit the Tiger Woods exhibition at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., you'll see a photo of Sifford. Read MoreTiger Woods with Sifford during a practice round of the World Golf Championship Bridgestone Invitational in 2009.In breaking through the 'Caucasian only' clause in golf, Sifford helped open the door for other Black golfers, including the most famous Black golfer of all time, Woods. And it's something Woods recognized, saying in 2015 following Sifford's death that he himself might not have been a professional golfer if it hadn't been for Sifford. ""He's like the Grandpa I never had,"" Woods said after a practice round in advance of the 2015 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines, the day after Sifford's death. ""It's been a long night, and I'm sure it will be a long few days. He fought, and what he did, the courage for him to stick with it and be out here and play.""I probably wouldn't be here (without Sifford). My dad would never have picked up the game. Who knows if the clause would still exist or not? But he broke it down.""While Sifford was the first Black player to make it through in golf, he had someone close to him to lean on. Robinson, who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball as a player in 1947, was a friend of Sifford's, and from his own experiences, passed on some advice to the golfer before he started his journey to make it onto the Tour. ""Jackie told him that he's going to have to face up to a lot of things, not respond to a lot of things because once he did that, it would be harder for him and harder for the people coming up behind him,"" Charles Sifford, Charlie's son, remembers. ""So he kept a stiff upper lip, bit his tongue and just dealt with what was presented towards him because he knew if he messed up that it would be even harder for the next guy coming along.""READ: Phil Mickelson's 'simply amazing' win and a victory against his doubtersSifford studies a shot in the FHP Health Classic at the Ojai Inn Country Club in Ojai, California.Having to moveBorn in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1922, Sifford got into golf through the only avenue available to a young, Black kid -- caddying. But he wanted to play the game -- at the age of 13, he could shoot a par round of 18 holes -- and not carry someone else's bag. However, growing up in the age of segregation, opportunities for him to gain experience on courses weren't easy to come by. He did eventually begin playing professionally in 1948, but -- because of the so-called ""Caucasian only"" clause which blocked Black players from playing with their White counterparts -- Sifford had to settle for playing in Black-only competitions.By the time Sifford was in his 30s, segregation laws were slowly being abandoned, but golf proved less quick in moving with the times.""In 1959, you still had the 'Caucasian only' clause, and it was easy to see how it could persist because golf was played on these private clubs, and they were able to continue to enforce the segregation rules,"" Nancy Churnin -- author of ""Charlie Takes His Shot: How Charlie Sifford Broke the Color Barrier in Golf"" -- told CNN Sport. Sifford practices on the range. ""So if you can't step foot in these private clubs, how are you going to play?""Sifford's journey to play on the PGA Tour was not a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was something he worked to achieve for years. His first attempt to break onto the Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA) Tour in 1952 was met with vitriol and racial pressure.At the Phoenix Open, Sifford and his all-Black foursome -- which included the heavyweight boxer Joe Louis -- found excrement in the cup of the first hole and had to wait nearly an hour for it to be replaced.Unable to display his ability with all the best players, Sifford took his talents elsewhere -- to great success. He won the United Golf Association's National Negro Open six times, securing consecutive victories from 1952 through 1956. However, his dream was to showcase his abilities on the biggest stage in golf with the best in the business, and that meant making some sacrifices, as his son, Charles, remembers. ""When I was about 10 years old, I realized that we lived in Philadelphia, and my father really couldn't play in a lot of tournaments,"" he told CNN Sport. ""There wasn't a lot of exposure to golf on the East Coast so we moved to the West Coast when I was 10. And that's when he told me that in order to succeed or have a chance to succeed, we had to move west.""READ: Juggling a pro golf career when you're a MomSifford is presented with the North-South Negro Golf Tournament trophy by night club celebrity Nat ""King"" Cole. Breaking through Baseball star Robinson was a figure of inspiration and an example of what Sifford hoped to achieve in golf. But Sifford also realized he was going to need some legal help. After his move out to the West Coast of the US, Sifford became friends with California attorney general Stanley Mosk.Mosk was Jewish and had also experienced discrimination firsthand. He played golf at the Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles, which allowed members from the Jewish community when other clubs didn't allow them access.Award-winning actor Billy Crystal, in his eulogy for Muhammad Ali at the great boxer's funeral in 2016, recalled an incident which highlighted golf's closed-door policy. Ali invited his good friend Crystal to go for a run on a golf course, not realizing that the club didn't allow Jewish members. ""(Ali) was incensed: 'I'm a Black Muslim and they let me run there. Little brother, I'm never gonna run there again,'"" Crystal remembers Ali saying. Billy Crystal and Muhammad Ali at Audemars Piguet's Time To Give Celebrity Watch Auction For Charity, held at Christie's Auction House in New York City in 2000.Sifford's skill impressed Mosk immediately. And the fact that someone with such ability was unable to perform on the biggest stage angered him. So Mosk set about helping Sifford in his quest to play on the PGA Tour. As the attorney general of California, Mosk was able to bring about some political sway to Sifford's battle. Later, Mosk served as Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court for 37 years -- the longest tenure in that court's history. After years of letters and conversations, Sifford finally earned a PGA Tour player card in 1960 at the age of 39, becoming the first Black player to play on the Tour.A year later, following significant pressure, the PGA Tour dropped its ""Caucasian only"" membership clause. However, Sifford was consistently subjected to racist abuse from White golfers and spectators. His son Charles also remembers hearing stories about death threats sent to his father during those years. ""Several times when he was playing down in the South (region of the US), he had a couple of death threats,"" Charles explained. ""People would call him at his hotel room and told him that if he showed up at the golf course, they were going to kill him. ""He said: 'Well, you're just going to have to do that because I'm showing up at the golf course.' So he was just that determined not to let anybody stand in his way and doing what he wanted to do. And he had that drive in him.

However, the 1967 Greater Hartford Open -- now the Travelers Championship -- in Connecticut proved a watershed. ""That was the first time the crowd was on his side,"" according to Churnin. And it appeared to make a difference, as Sifford claimed his maiden PGA Tour victory at the event, becoming the first Black player to earn a PGA Tour win. Sifford is presented a check for $20,000 plus the trophy after winning the Los Angeles Open.Although he wasn't aware his dad had won because there wasn't wall-to-wall TV golf coverage as there is today, Charles remembers a palpable change in Sifford after the momentous victory. ""I saw it in the newspaper, and I was really excited for him because that was a lifelong dream to be able to win on the PGA Tour. And it took a lot of pressure off of him. He appeared to be more relaxed knowing that he did it once, and there was always a possibility he could do it again.""Sifford would go on to win the 1969 Los Angeles Open (now The Genesis Invitational) as well as the 1975 Senior PGA Championship and become an original member of PGA Tour Champions, where he won the Suntree Classic.In 2004, he became the first Black golfer to be enshrined in the World Golf Hall of Fame.

Although Charles admits that Sifford was ""highly disappointed"" there hasn't been a huge influx of Black golfers following him, being the first Black player on the PGA Tour was something he was extremely proud of.

On some days, though, there will only be a handful of guests visiting the facility dedicated to the ""greatest all-sport athlete of all time."" Even in her hometown, the name Babe Didrikson Zaharias isn't always widely known.Zaharias, who was born in 1911 and named Mildred Ella Didrikson, not only helped transform golf from a predominantly amateur sport into a professional one, but also held multiple Olympic world records.As well as being one of the 13 founding members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) in 1950, she went on to win 14 consecutive tournaments at the peak of her career.Van Natta Jr. believes it is ""quite disappointing"" that Zaharias' name isn't better known given all she did for golf.However, because of Zaharias' love of entertaining the gallery on the golf course with lewd jokes and colorful language, coupled with her refusal to conform to the traditional stereotypes of femininity of the time, she was a pariah amongst her fellow competitors and the subject of sexism and prejudice from the media.Read More""If somebody was looking at Babe and they were sexist or they didn't think that women belonged on a golf course or in a track and field event, she heard a lot of that,"" Don Van Natta Jr. -- author of ""Wonder Girl: The Magnificent Sporting Life of Babe Didrikson Zaharias"" -- told CNN Sport.""She was criticized for her look; she was criticized for not being ladylike enough. There were comments made in the press, that she should be home sitting by the phone, waiting for a suitor to call her as opposed to being out competing. It was very harsh, negative, critical things. And they hurt her deeply.""READ: Why record-breaking drives could change golf as we know itZaharias became a ""huge draw"" for golf crowds due to her energetic levels on the course, according to Van Natta Jr.'American sports heroine'The daughter of immigrants from Norway, sport always played a big part in Zaharias' life.From baseball and basketball to track and field and tennis, Zaharias seemingly excelled at whichever sport she turned her hand to. She earned her nickname ""Babe"" as a result of her baseball ability and comparisons between her and Babe Ruth.While she tried golf early on, a career in athletics was Zaharias' primary focus at a young age. Such was her dedication and cross-discipline ability at track and field, stories of Zaharias single-handedly beating entire teams became common across Texas.The pinnacle of her athletic career coincided with the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, a time when athletes, unlike today, didn't always specialize in one sport, but often entered multiple disciplines in the hopes of achieving success.Zaharias became a world record holders in the hurdles even before she started playing golf professionally.Women, however, were unable to enter more than three events, so Zaharias participated in the javelin, high jump and 80m hurdles.To this day, she is still the only track and field athlete, male or female, to win individual Olympic medals in running, throwing and jumping events. Zaharias won gold medals in both the hurdles and the javelin, and a silver medal for the high jump, but only after she was adjudged to have used an improper technique in a jump-off after tying with fellow American Jean Shiley.Van Natta Jr. believes that Zaharias could have won more medals had she been allowed to compete in a greater number of events.""I don't know about gold medals, but I think she could have medaled in probably at least five [sports],"" he said.""She came in first place, just among obviously her American counterparts, at the event at Northwestern [University] that was the qualifying event for the Olympics, and she won five of those events. So I believe she could have been medaled in five (javelin, hurdles, high jump, 100m sprint and discus) easily if she had been allowed to.""READ: The golfer who drove over 4,000 miles across the US to play in tournamentsZaharias throws the javelin to win the gold medal during the 1932 Olympic Games.BeginningsIn the 1930s, it was difficult for women to earn any sort of living in athletics due to an almost total lack of prize money and sponsorship opportunities.""Babe was very much thinking about a way to make a living as a sports woman,"" Van Natta Jr. said. ""And so she figured out that golf was one of the places that you could actually do it, even though a lot of the events were amateur events. But if you succeeded at them, she figured she could market herself and find some income that way.""Zaharias took up golf with a ""competitiveness that was beyond fierce,"" Susan Cayleff -- who authored two books about Zaharias' life -- explained.""She would drive golf balls until her palms bled and didn't set any kind of realistic limit on herself in terms of physical expectations,"" she said.However, her previous success in other sports led the United States Golf Association (USGA) to bar Zaharias from playing in amateur women's tournaments, compelling her instead to play in professional men's PGA Tour events.""They barred her in part because of a snob aspect,"" said Van Natta Jr. ""She was seen from the wrong side of the tracks, she was seen as a poor woman, she was coarse in the way she carried herself. She started defeating these wealthier women, well connected women to the USGA, so they knocked her out for a while.""READ: How Brendon Todd came in from the cold to grab himself a slice of the actionZaharias practises on Pinehurst's golf links for the exhibition match in New York.Standing outWhilst playing one of these PGA Tour events, Zaharias was paired with George Zaharias, a famous wrestler from the time. The two married in 1938, with George becoming her promoter and manager.With her husband's help, she became a ""huge draw for the crowds,"" Van Natta Jr. notes, with her ""chattering"" nature making her one of the sport's biggest draws.She was said to have shown up at professional tournaments and announced to the media: ""The Babe is here! Who is going to finish second?"" as well as standing on the first tee before teeing off and announcing that she was going to ""loosen my girdle and let it fly.""Babe Didrikson marries George Zaharias on December 23, 1938, in St. Louis.However, her lack of femininity -- ""telling bawdy jokes and swearing, sometimes spitting, drinking,"" according to Cayleff  -- and the perceived ""working class, gritty, sweaty"" nature of track and field competition put Zaharias at odds with her more traditional female competitors.And because she stood out from the rest of the field and wasn't the most gracious of victors -- ""She would rub the people who she defeated, their noses in their defeat,"" Van Natta Jr. explained -- Zaharias consistently found herself on the receiving end of negative coverage from a predominantly male media.Cayleff describes Zaharias as being a ""gender trickster"" as she behaved ""in ways that were absolutely contradictory to ideal femininity.""But as a result, she was vilified in the press, with even her sexuality coming into question at times.""They took her uniqueness and what I refer to as her gender outlaw status,"" Cayleff said. ""They take her behaviors and, particularly before she's married, absolutely craft her as a freak with newspaper headlines like: 'Mr., Miss or It?' or 'Which bathroom should Babe Didrikson use?'""They feared or presumed she was lesbian and then a particular term was coined in reference to her. She was called a 'muscle moll' or a member of a third sex. People were baffled and troubled by her gender presentation and particularly women golfers who tended to be of a more upper-class background and fancied themselves refined; they demonized her.""READ: Golf's new star is living proof you should never give up on your dreamsZaharias drives off to the 15th tee during her semifinals match against Jean M. Donald at Gullane Links, Scotland in 1947.ConformingTo counter the negative coverage, Zaharias recruited the help of Bertha Bowen, a Dallas socialite, who taught her how to ""apply makeup, how to wear a girdle and get her hair styled,"" Cayleff explains.""She was the subject of absolutely vicious press after the 1932 Olympics where people were openly speculating and disparaging her sexuality and the like. And she understood, with the guidance of Bertha, that if she wanted to earn a living and keep her name in the public that she needed to seriously craft an image because who she legitimately was, was not someone that the American public was easy to embrace.""Even so, Zaharias' competitive nature meant that she found it difficult to fully integrate into typical golfing society. This didn't stop her from becoming one of the most successful women golfers of the time, winning 41 professional tournaments in total.And as one of the LPGA's 13 original members, she ""planned and organized the golf tournaments, drafted the by-laws, supervised membership, (and) set up the courses"" to help establish the professional women's game, the LGPA website explains.Zaharias urges the ball into the hole on the 18th green of Chicago's Tam O'Shanter Country Club in the Women's All-American Golf Tournament in 1950.Although she did a lot for the sport for women, Cayleff contends that Zaharias was not a ""self-conscious role model or promoter of opportunity for women in sports.""Cayleff recalls an incident she found while doing research for her book when Zaharias threatened to withdraw from a tournament going into the final round, despite leading by several shots, because, in her eyes, the prize money was not enough.""Babe was out for Babe. In an instance like that, she was an absolute impact on increasing the purse in women's golf, but it was not for the betterment of the sport or the betterment of the female athletes in general. It was for Babe.""It's a sort of mixed legacy. Yes, she absolutely impacted opportunities for athletes that came after her and athletes during her own lifetime, but she was in no way what we would call a feminist or gender conscious or concerned about equity in general,"" Cayleff said. ""She was concerned about a good payday for her and let the chips fall where they may be on that.""Zaharias chips up to the green with a line of fans watching her.LegacyIn 1953, Zaharias was diagnosed with colon cancer and, at the time, doctors were not even sure they could cure her. However, in 1954, she not only returned to playing the sport, but won the US Women's Open in Massachusetts, her 10th and final major, by a dozen strokes, while having a colostomy bag strapped to her side.Zaharias chose to go public with her fight against cancer. This decision -- plus her remarkable comeback and her extensive work with the American Cancer Society -- helped change her perception in the eyes of both the public and the media, with Cayleff saying that it ""heroized her in some ways to a new generation.""Didrikson (right) works out with the New York Rangers players Murray Murdock (center) and Andy Aitkenhead, goalie, in Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1933.""She was honored by President Eisenhower for her work with the American Cancer Society and did considerable fundraising for cancer research,"" Cayleff said.

The percentage of adults who told Gallup they identify as LGBTQ has doubled since 2012, per the polling firm, from 3.5% of Americans then to 7.1% of Americans in 2021. The rise can be attributed to Gen Z, according to Gallup -- about 21% of adults born between 1997 and 2003 identify as LGBTQ. Meanwhile, 10.5% of millennials, the generation that includes adults born between 1981 and 1996, identify as LGBTQ, per the poll, and the percentages dwindle among the preceding generations. Among LGBTQ adults in the US, more than half of them -- nearly 57% -- said they were bisexual, according to Gallup's poll. That encompasses about 4% of all US adults. Gallup reported that 20.7% of LGBTQ respondents identified as gay, 13.9% as lesbian and 10% as transgender. Bisexuality is the most common LGBTQ identity among members of Gens Z and X and millennials, Gallup reported, with 15% of all Gen Z adults saying they were bisexual. Read MoreThe results are a sign of increasing LGBTQ rights and representation, an expert saysIt makes sense that a greater percentage of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ compared to older generations, said Sharita Gruberg, vice president of LGBTQI+ Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress. Gruberg noted that the world in which the younger generation lives is one where same-sex marriage is legal nationwide, as well as one where awareness and visibility of orientations and identities other than heterosexual and cisgender continues to grow.""Gen Z has grown up at a time when stigma around LGBTQ identities is on the decline and rights are expanding,"" said Gruberg, who was not involved in the poll. ""As greater awareness about the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities grows, and as stigma surrounding LGBTQ identity lessens, we're likely to see more people self-identify as LGBTQ."" Florida's LGBTQ advocates are rallying to support young people in light of 'Don't Say Gay'Still, she said, LGBTQ rights aren't guaranteed for Gen Z. Many states don't have non-discrimination measures in place for LGBTQ residents, she said, and a 2020 Center for American Progress study found that over half of LGBTQ people hid their relationships to avoid discrimination. The Equality Act, which would ban discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and sex for employment and housing opportunities, among others, hasn't been passed despite members of Congress for years introducing versions of the legislation. Last year also saw the largest slate of anti-LGBTQ bills in recent US history, according to the Human Rights Campaign, with more than half of states introducing legislation that targeted LGBTQ residents, particularly transgender minors. This year's roster of bills may surpass last year's record, LGBTQ advocates told CNN earlier this month. "
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/newsom-california-covid-plan/index.html,Newsom announces new Covid response plan as California shifts focus to 'next phase' ,"By Eric Bradner, Stella Chan, Sara Finch and Paul LeBlanc, CNN","Washington (CNN)California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday unveiled his state's plan for the ""next phase"" of the Covid-19 pandemic, which puts a specific focus on learning to live with the coronavirus.""What we're announcing here today is about turning a page,"" the Democratic governor said in a speech in San Bernardino County on Thursday. ""We have all come to understand what was not understood at the beginning of this crisis, that there is no end date, that there is not a moment where we declare victory despite so many of the metaphors that were used during this pandemic -- the war metaphors where we said, 'We will defeat this virus.'""""In that light, we have put together a plan that we coin as the 'SMARTER' plan because we are smarter two years later. We are more adaptable. We are more capable to understand the nature of this disease,"" Newsom added.The plan is an acronym for the state's seven priorities moving forward: Shots, masks, awareness, readiness, testing, education and Rx.The shift in approach comes as the Omicron wave that has slammed the United States this winter recedes -- and as other Democratic-led states move to relax restrictions. New York and Rhode Island have dropped their mask mandates in recent days; Illinois, New Jersey and Oregon are set to do so in the coming weeks.Read MoreCalifornia has long been among the most strict states in imposing Covid-19 health mandates. Newsom was the first governor to implement a statewide stay-at-home order in March 2020. But he and other Democratic governors who have imposed public health measures are adjusting their approaches as Americans willing to tolerate the risks seek a return to normalcy in some ways.With California's new plan, Newsom said, ""we move out of the pandemic phase and we move into a phase which should allow you confidence that we are not walking away. That we're taking the lessons learned and were leaning into the future.""In recent interviews, Newsom had previewed a shift in strategy to treat Covid-19 like any other virus -- including lifting the state's mandate for masks in schools. California's mask mandate for indoor businesses expired this week, though local governments can still impose their own mandates.""In that endemic plan, we will be able to answer many questions that many of you have about the world we are living in and where we are going with this virus and where can create criteria as we transition to the endemic phase,"" Newsom said last week, previewing the announcement.He said the plan will take into consideration what did and did not work in the last two years and how to address possible surges and new variants.The California governor could find himself at odds with Democratic lawmakers who control the state's legislature and are pushing for strict vaccination requirements. Proposals include one that would require vaccines for all students, except those granted medical exemptions, and allow those 12 and older to get vaccinated without their parents' consent, and one that would require businesses to require all employees and contractors to be vaccinated.As Democratic lawmakers consider going further than Newsom has, Republicans have long claimed that his mandates have gone too far -- using photos of Newsom hobnobbing maskless at a November 2020 indoor dinner party at The French Laundry restaurant to make their case.Noting that division Thursday, Newsom acknowledged, ""There are those that prefer to walk away, to deny the realities of the last few years, let the virus in all its forms and manifestations continue to take its course. That's not the approach we're arguing for. It's not the approach we're taking. We are taking a more sensible, and I would argue more sustainable health care approach based on the lessons learned to prepare for the unknown.""An attempt to recall Newsom last year, with Republican talk radio host Larry Elder emerging as the top candidate to replace him, failed in the overwhelmingly blue state. Newsom won the September recall election, with 62% of California voters saying he should not be removed from office.California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said Monday that ""California's plan, of course, will talk about data, and data elements and their importance but will largely be focused on how we stay prepared and ready and what Californians should come to expect.""""I think it's really important that we not just talk about endemic phase but how do continue to live with a virus that changes and kind of throws curveballs at different times,"" Ghaly said, noting the unpredictability of the virus. ""So, for California and our future, it is about being ready and being prepared.""This story has been updated with remarks Thursday from California Gov. Gavin Newsom."

The office may ask the appeals court for a re-hearing, the statement continued.North Miami police officer charged with shooting unarmed caretakerEric Schwartzreich and Anthony Bruno, attorneys for Aledda, told CNN, ""We look forward to the State dropping the charges or in the alternative to Mr. Aledda being found not guilty."" In July 2016, Aledda was one of 13 officers who responded to a call about a man with a gun, court documents show. When officers arrived, they encountered Arnaldo Rios-Soto, a man with severe developmental disabilities, and his caretaker Charles Kinsey in the middle of an intersection, according to court documents.Read MoreRios-Soto was rocking back and forth and playing with a silver toy truck, court documents said. Kinsey told the first two officers who arrived that Rios-Soto had a toy. Aledda arrived sometime after that, and some officers on scene said it appeared the toy was a gun. Aledda's lawyers argued that he thought he was observing a hostage situation. He shot at Rios-Soto three times but missed, hitting Kinsey once, according to court documents. Kinsey was wounded in the hip.""He took the shots because he believed that a hostage was in danger,"" Schwartzreich and Bruno said in a statement. Aledda is ""elated by the appeals court decision"" and wants to return to work as a law enforcement officer, Schwartzreich said. CNN reached out to the North Miami Police Department for comment but did not hear back.How the shooting unfolded An affidavit from the July 2016 shooting stated Rios-Soto had ventured into the street outside a home for people with mental disabilities. Kinsey followed him in an attempt to bring him back inside.Rios-Soto sat down in the street and was playing with a silver toy truck, which a passerby thought may have been a gun and called police, according to the affidavit.Charles Kinsey sustained a hip injury in the shooting.As armed officers made their way into closer position, Kinsey lay down on the ground with his hands in the air, yelling at police that there was no threat, according to cell phone footage of the incident.""All he has is a toy truck in his hands. A toy truck,"" Kinsey said in the video. ""I am a behavior tech at a group home.""One officer about 15-20 feet away heard Kinsey's yelling and said over the radio to ""use caution"" because ""the person advised that it's a toy."" A minute later, that officer said over the radio that he had a visual and that the item did not appear to be a firearm.Shortly after that, Aledda shot three times, according to the affidavit.Aledda was charged in 2017 with two felony counts of attempted manslaughter with a deadly weapon, one misdemeanor count of culpable negligence for injuring Kinsey and one misdemeanor count of culpable negligence for endangering Rios-Soto, according to court documents.In March 2019, a jury acquitted Aledda of the misdemeanor culpable negligence charge relating to Rios-Soto. However, a mistrial was declared because the jury could not reach a verdict for the remaining three charges, court documents show.During a second trial in June 2019, Aledda was acquitted on the two attempted manslaughter counts but convicted of misdemeanor culpable negligence, according to court documents.CNN's Eric Levenson and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report."

Locke's mother, Karen Wells, reiterated her family's request to pass a law to do away with no-knock warrants in her eulogy at her son's funeral.""At the end of the day you are going to pass the law of the no-knock warrants, ban it starting here in the Twin Cities where my son was born and raised,"" Wells said.Ben Crump, an attorney for the Locke family, also called out Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for not banning no-knock warrants.""If you would have followed your ban on no-knock warrants like you said, let's be clear, Amir Locke would still be here,"" Crump said.Read MoreCNN reported in November that Jacob and then police chief Medaria Arradondo announced they were instituting a policy that required officers to announce their presence and purpose before entering a building, except in special circumstances.Andre Locke, center, and Karen Wells, second left, parents of Amir Locke, attorney Ben Crump and Rev. Al Sharpton attend the funeral of Amir Locke at the Shiloh Temple International Ministries in Minneapolis, February 17, 2022.At the end of the service, Amir's father, Andre Locke, said he was broken and called on Minneapolis police to ""do what's right"" and to stop ""hiding behind the blue.""Police shot and killed Locke February 2 in a Minneapolis apartment while they executed a warrant in which he wasn't named, and that didn't require police to knock and give any occupant a chance to open the door.A brief body camera video of Locke's shooting shows an officer quietly sliding a key into the apartment's door. After the door opens, a group of officers barge in, yelling commands. Locke, who appeared to be sleeping, gets up holding a gun his family said he legally owned. Police then opened fire. Locke's parents have asked President Joe Biden to advocate for a national ban on such warrants in the name of their son.""The no-knock warrant is what caused Amir's death,"" Andre Locke told CNN earlier this month.This week, a division of Minneapolis' Civil Rights Department announced it is leading a ""special review"" of the police department's no-knock warrant policy. The Office of Police Conduct Review will ""focus on identifying and recommending specific changes and improvements to departmental policy and procedures,"" the city said in a news release. ""This important review will complement our engagement with external experts to provide needed clarity around the impacts of these policies for both community and officers,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said.Meanwhile, the officer who shot Locke, Mark Hanneman, has been placed on routine administrative leave pending an ongoing state investigation.What the video shows JUST WATCHEDBodycam video shows officers shoot Black man during no-knock warrantReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBodycam video shows officers shoot Black man during no-knock warrant 02:54During the raid that killed Locke, Minneapolis police were looking for suspects -- including Locke's teenage cousin -- and evidence connected to a homicide in neighboring St. Paul, according to warrant applications.Locke was not named in the no-knock warrant, and his family says he acquired his firearm legally.The video of Locke's shooting released by the city was 14 seconds long. In it, officers are heard yelling, ""Police! Search warrant!"" during their morning entry into the apartment.""Hands! Hands! Hands!"" one officer yells while others yell ""Get on the fu**ing ground!"" as they make their way toward the back of a couch where a man is seen wrapped in blankets at 6:48 a.m., according to the footage. One officer kicks the back of the couch, appearing to wake up the man, who looks up to see the officers all around him.There's a growing consensus in law enforcement over no-knock warrants: The risks outweigh the rewardsHe begins to try and stand up, still wrapped in blankets, and is seen holding a gun, according to the footage. And then three gunshots are heard from officers.""We've seen this time and time again, watching the situation with Ahmaud Arbery, Daunte Wright, George Floyd, and our hearts go out to those families,"" Andre Locke said, naming three Black men killed in controversial circumstances, including two by police officers.Minneapolis policy under scrutiny The shooting death of Breonna Taylor during a no-knock warrant service in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020 and the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer two months later were catalysts for a nationwide reckoning over police policies. Days after Locke's shooting, Frey imposed an immediate moratorium on the request and execution of no-knock warrants. But his announcement highlighted such warrants can still be implemented if there is ""an imminent threat of harm to an individual or the public and then the warrant must be approved by the Chief.""Examples of those circumstances include hostage situations and extreme domestic violence situations in which an officer may have to protect someone from the threat of severe bodily harm, he said.But Locke's family says the moratorium doesn't go far enough.""We have to challenge them not to put a Band-Aid over no-knock warrants,"" Locke family attorney Jeff Storms told CNN. ""They need to take this step and completely ban no-knock warrants. It's not safe for either side of the door.""CNN's Omar Jimenez, Ray Sanchez, Brad Parks, Peter Nickeas, Steve Almasy, Eliott C.

us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/unsolved-civil-rights-murder-bill-extension/index.html,Ossoff and Cruz push bill to extend term of the board tasked with investigating unsolved Civil Rights-era murders  ,"By Kaanita Iyer, CNN"," (CNN)Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas on Thursday introduced a bill that aims to give an independent agency more time to investigate unsolved racially motivated murders from the Civil Rights era.  The bipartisan proposal would build on a 2018 law, extending the term of the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board to 2027. That would allow the five-member board to reopen and review cases of Black people murdered between 1940 and 1979, and to collect and release relevant documents. According to data collected by Plain Talk History, a community of educators, there were at least 45 such murders between 1940 and 1968. Tennessee and Florida aren't the only states where the history of racism is under siegeThe board was authorized in 2019 by then-President Donald Trump to work until 2024. But Trump did not make any nominations. President Joe Biden announced his picks last summer -- and withdrew one in January -- but the four have not yet been confirmed. A fifth nominee has also not been named, as the clock ticks to unearth evidence from more than 40 years ago. ""During the Civil Rights movement, there were far too many unsolved violent race-based crimes committed against African Americans,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""It's my hope that by giving the Review Board more time to examine the case files related to these unsolved crimes, we can shed sunlight on these Civil Rights cold cases and finally bring justice to the victims and their families."" Ossoff echoed Cruz's comments. ""The victims of lynching's and unsolved civil rights crimes deserve justice. So do their families,"" he said.  Read MoreDemonizing Black victims is an old racist trope that didn't work for defense attorneys this timeThe idea of the board came from a group of New Jersey high school students who began sending out public information requests to the FBI and the Department of Justice in 2015 to solve unresolved crimes from the era themselves. The group then drafted a bill, which eventually caught the attention of Rep. Bobby Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, who introduced the legislation in the US House of Representatives. If these cases proceed to criminal judgment, arrests and sentences are very unlikely as there are only a few living perpetrators of the killings that date back to more than 80 years.  But Hank Klibanoff, one of the nominees, said that ""while we're not likely to see many opportunities for criminal judgments, we may well see more opportunities for the judgment of history as these records become available."" ""And we may see more opportunities for racial peacemaking among families of perpetrators and victims,"" Klibanoff, director of the Georgia Civil Rights Cold Cases Project at Emory University, added during his testimony at a House committee hearing last month. Other nominees include Margaret Burnham, a professor at Northeastern University School of Law who established its Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project; Gabrielle Dudley, an archivist from Emory University; and Brenda Stevenson, a professor of African American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.  Prior to creating the board, Congress passed the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act in 2008 -- and reauthorized in 2016 -- which pushed the US Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate cold case files. Under the law, the agencies have opened 152 cases as of February 2021 -- with one that dates back to 1934, according to an annual report released by Attorney General Merrick Garland last year. At least 118 have been closed.  Under the Emmet Till Act, the infamous case of its namesake was reopened. Till was a Black teenager who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955 after a White woman accused him of making sexual advances, but the woman allegedly told a professor in 2008 that some parts of her accusation were not true. However, the DOJ could not prove that the woman lied, and it closed the investigation in December. Some of the cases that remain open include the killings of three students on the campus of South Carolina State University, a historically Black college, in the Orangeburg Massacre of 1968. Twenty-seven others were also injured when police officers open fired into a crowd of nearly 200 students gathered to protest segregation in the city's only bowling alley. Rush is expected to introduce the House version of Ossoff and Cruz's bill to extend the board's term. ""While it is too late to bring back the Black men and women murdered during the Civil Rights era in racist acts of terror, it is not too late to bring answers and closure to families of victims who never saw justice,"" Rush said.  This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."

""It's going to allow the most significant restoration of the Great Lakes in the history of the Great Lakes,"" Biden said in remarks in Lorain, Ohio. The bulk of funding is targeted to restore what the Environmental Protection Agency has identified as severely degraded ""Areas of Concern."" The administration projects that funding from the infrastructure law -- combined with funds from annual Great Lakes Restoration Initiative appropriations and other sources -- should allow restoration of at least 22 areas of concern across Wisconsin, New York, Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana and Illinois by 2030, with infrastructure funding also benefiting three additional sites over the same period.Exclusive: Experts say the term 'drought' may be insufficient to capture what is happening in the WestThe President said some of the sites that will be addressed have been ""dangerously polluted for decades.""Biden noted the lakes provide drinking water and support more than one million jobs in manufacturing, tourism, transportation, warehousing, farming and fishing. A 2020 EPA analysis of the Great Lakes found the region supports more than 1.3 million jobs and generates $82 billion in wages annually.Read MoreThe President quoted Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, who was born in Lorain, in his speech. The book the President quoted, ""Beloved,"" has been the target of some conservatives trying to ban the book from public school curriculums in Virginia. Biden noted Friday would have been Morrison's birthday -- she died in 2019 -- and said she is one of first lady Jill Biden's favorite authors. ""She once wrote, 'We got more yesterdays than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow.' Places like Lorain have a lot of proud yesterdays. Now, you're going to have some brighter tomorrows,"" the President said. The President made the announcement from the Black River in Lorain, Ohio, a tributary of Lake Erie and one of the 22 areas listed in Thursday's funding disbursement.""The Great Lakes are a vital economic engine and an irreplaceable environmental wonder, supplying drinking water for more than 40 million people, supporting nearly 1.5 million jobs, and sustaining life for thousands of species,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan wrote in a statement shared with CNN on Wednesday. ""Through the investments from President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure deal, we will make unprecedented progress in our efforts to restore and protect the waters and the communities of the Great Lakes basin.""Per the EPA, the river earned the nickname ""river of fish tumors,"" ""due to its long history of industrial, agricultural, and urban uses, which led to poor water quality, loss of biodiversity, habitat degradation and sedimentation.""""This $1 billion investment will accelerate the cleanup across sites across the Great Lakes Basin, from Duluth, Minnesota, to Buffalo, New York, and everywhere in between, including several major areas of concern in Ohio, where the President will be traveling tomorrow,"" a senior administration official told reporters Wednesday. ""This accelerated cleanup and restoration effort will deliver environmental health and recreational benefits for communities throughout the region. It will also help revitalize the economy in these communities, like it's doing, and Loraine's Black River waterfront.""White House to unveil multi-pronged approach to reduce emissions in the manufacturing sectorCleaning up degraded waterways is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor, with extensive sediment remediation required. One official estimated that cleanup projects for areas of concern near Milwaukee and Detroit could cost up to $100 million each. Per the administration, the funding will be disbursed in accordance with the White House's Justice40 Initiative, which tasks agencies with ensuring that at least 40% of federal award dollars are directed to those it designates ""disadvantaged communities,"" including cities like Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Buffalo, New York, Lorain and Duluth, Minnesota.""With this investment, President Biden is delivering major environmental, public health, and economic wins for the Great Lakes region,"" former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who's tasked with implementing the infrastructure law, wrote in a statement shared with CNN on Wednesday.""Building a better America requires us to confront legacy pollution and clean up the environment -- ensuring our kids drink clean water and creating good-paying jobs in the process. We know that cleaning up these waterways and improving the health of the Great Lakes will also create great economic opportunities for communities across the eight-state region and beyond."""
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/ron-johnson-pocan-judge-biden/index.html,GOP Sen. Ron Johnson flip-flops to block Biden judicial nominee,By Tierney Sneed," (CNN)Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said Tuesday he would not support a federal court nominee he had previously recommended to President Joe Biden -- a move that could stop the nominee, Wisconsin state court Judge William Pocan, from being confirmed. Johnson's reversal prompted criticism from Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, who nonetheless signaled he would honor the so-called ""blue slip"" practice that allows home states senators to stop the district court nominees from moving forward. Democrats embrace hardball judicial nomination tactics GOP adopted under Trump ""Sen. Johnson is blocking this committee from proceeding on a nominee he recommended to President Biden,"" Durbin said at a committee hearing Wednesday. Pocan, nominated for the district court for Wisconsin's Eastern District, had been slated to testify at the hearing until Johnson announced that he would not support the nomination.Pocan would be the first LGBTQ federal judge in Wisconsin, according to the White House.This is the first instance of a home state senator withholding a blue slip -- which indicates their approval of a nominee -- for a Biden nominee, and is notable given that Johnson previously said he was ""pleased to recommend"" him.  Read MorePocan, whose brother is Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, was one of four potential nominees recommended in June by Johnson and his Democratic counterpart for the vacancy. Johnson and Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin used a bipartisan judicial selection committee for vetting potential nominees to the bench. In a statement Tuesday night, Johnson said that he had ""been hearing concerns from the Green Bay legal community that they needed a judge who is locally based and actively involved in their community."" Pocan, a Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge since 2006, does not live in Green Bay, where the vacancy in question is based. However, according to Durbin, Pocan had said that he would move to Green Bay if confirmed. ""Sen. Johnson knew full well back in June that Judge Pocan did not live in Green Bay at this time,"" Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said. Johnson's statement also attempted to connect Pocan's nomination of the December tragedy in Waukesha, in which six people were killed when a man drove into a Christmas parade, even though Pocan had no connection to the case.The man, Darrell Brooks, had been previously released on an $1,000 bail after being accused of running over a woman in a domestic abuse case -- a matter Pocan also was not involved in.""I cannot support someone for a lifetime appointment that has granted low bail for someone charged with violent felonies,"" Johnson said Tuesday. Since 2017, according to the White House, Pocan has served on the Milwaukee court's civil and family divisions, where the cases do not concern bail. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates noted that the American Bar Association had granted Pocan its highest rating and Bates said in a statement that said that Pocan had ""absolutely no connection to the Waukesha tragedy."" ""Judge Pocan would also make history as the first LGBTQ federal judge for Wisconsin,"" Bates said. ""Senator Johnson's arbitrary reversal is unfortunate, and the rationale given for it is without foundation.""    Judiciary Committee senators spar over the tone of questions directed at nominees of color Johnson's office, in a follow up statement to CNN Wednesday, pointed to a case called State of Wisconsin v. Davario D. Washington, where, according to Johnson spokesperson Alexa Henning, Pocan granted a ""low bail"" to an ""individual charged with violent felonies"" According to a transcript obtained by CNN of the 2015 bail hearing that Pocan presided over, the judge sided with the prosecutor who was seeking to increase the defendant's bail to $5,000. ""Senator Johnson has the right to overrule the recommendation of his judicial commission as new information comes to light, just as Senator Tammy Baldwin did in 2018 during the nomination process of Gordon Giampietro for Wisconsin's Eastern District,"" Henning said. (Baldwin asked then-President Donald Trump to withdraw Giampietro's nomination after learning about 2015 comments -- not disclosed in the vetting process for the nomination --  in which the nominee bashed Supreme Court rulings expanding the rights of same-sex couples.).Home state senators' leverage over nomineesBlue slips have historically been used as a tool to force presidents to work with senators to fill judicial vacancies in their states. Under Trump, Senate Republicans eliminated the blue state practice for appellate court nominees and ultimately 17 circuit court judges were confirmed over the objections of their home state senators. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a 6th Circuit nominee who was the first Biden appellate nominee to be opposed by the senators from the state of the vacancy, Tennessee. Republicans argued that the Biden White House did less to negotiate with the Tennessee delegation than the Trump White House offered Democratic senators -- a claim Democrats rebuked. Durbin said Wednesday that his office only learned at 7 p.m. on Tuesday that Johnson would prevent Pocan's nomination from moving forward. Durbin said that over the course of nearly a month, his staff reached out to Johnson's staff on four separate occasions and received no response. ""Such a lack of communication is unacceptable and frankly disrespectful to the nominee and his family,"" Durbin said. This story has been updated with additional details."
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/alabama-redistricting-black-voters/index.html,'Devastating implications': GOP redistricting battles in Alabama and other states raise concerns about voter suppression,"By Kaanita Iyer, CNN"," (CNN)Kenya Goodson, a 46-year-old Black woman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, has voted in every election since she was 19.  But last week's Supreme Court decision to allow Alabama's new congressional map -- which voting rights advocates say dilutes the power of Black voters -- to remain in place has left Goodson, who volunteers to register voters, discouraged about casting a ballot herself. ""I was really very hurt, you know, and angry really by the decision by our Supreme Court,"" said Goodson, an adjunct professor at the University of Montevallo. ""There are people that are making decisions, not because it's the law, but they're making decisions to uphold White supremacy by diluting my vote."" ""It is discouraging because I don't know what I could do as a citizen to change anything,"" she added.  Kenya Goodson registers voter and assists with the Census count at the Government Plaza in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Legal challenges are expected to continue in this case, and similar lawsuits have been filed in Texas and Georgia, which will bring the issue of voting rights, racial gerrymandering and discriminatory election practices to the forefront ahead of the midterm elections. Read MoreThe Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments over the Alabama map, which could determine the fate of the landmark Voting Rights Act.Goodson said she is still going to vote, and will encourage others to do so, because ""our ancestors ... helped us to get this right,"" but community organizers worry there could be ""devastating implications"" that marginalize Black voters and could, in turn, impact turnout and faith in the democratic process.  LaTosha Brown, an Alabama native and founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said this ruling is ""really rubber-stamping voter disenfranchisement."" ""But it's not just about Alabama,"" Brown added. ""It has implications for voter protections around the country."" What is redistricting?Felicia Scalzetti, a redistricting organizer for the Alabama Election Protection Network and the Ordinary People Society, told CNN, ""The problem with redistricting is that ... it changes who you can vote for.""  ""You can encourage people to turn out all you want,"" Scalzetti said. ""But if the slate of people on the ballot do not actually represent your community because your community is cut six ways to Sunday, there's no amount of turning out that's going to fix that.""  Redistricting is the process of reallocating congressional seats every 10 years based on population changes reflected in the US Census and then redrawing the boundaries of the congressional districts so each has an equal population.  In 35 states, the legislature has control over the redistricting process, which raises concerns about the incumbent party manipulating the process in its favor, also known as partisan gerrymandering. In this election cycle, 20 of the 35 states are controlled by Republicans, compared with 11 favoring Democrats, according to the Pew Research Center. Four states have divided governments.  'They know where Black voters live': Challengers say 'race blind' redistricting maps are anything butSimilarly, redrawing in terms of race is known as racial gerrymandering. Since voters of color tend to favor Democrats, redistricting driven by party interests or fueled by racial motivation -- whether to curb voters of color or amplify their influence -- go hand in hand.  Alabama's Republican-drawn map gives Black voters the majority in only one of seven districts despite them making up 27% of the population. Thus, the Alabama lawsuit argued that it had been drawn based on race, and used the ""cracking"" and ""packing"" tactics to specifically dilute the power of Black voters.  The map lumped areas with high concentrations of Black people together in one district where they could be the majority -- known as packing -- and split up other Black voters in the state so they remain a minority in all other districts -- known as cracking. It will remain in place for the state's primaries in May. 

""The thinking that we could just disenfranchise people at the state level is still here and it still operates a large part of the state's attitude toward our voting structure,"" Dev Wakeley, policy analyst at Alabama Arise, a nonprofit public policy advocacy organization, told CNN.Wakeley and others say the map is a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits any practice that denies or curtails the right to vote based on race. The law included a provision that mandated states with a history of discriminatory practices, which included Alabama, to obtain federal approval before changing electoral practices, but it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.  In fact, a lower court unanimously ruled that the new congressional map violates the Voting Rights Act, and the three-judge panel -- which included two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump -- ordered the state to draw another district where Blacks made up a majority of voters or close to it.  What the Supreme Court's decision on Alabama's maps could mean for the Voting Rights Act""No one had any faith that the state of Alabama was going to have voters' best interests at heart,"" Wakeley said. ""We expected a little more of an attempt at a fig leaf by the Supreme Court.""  But with a conservative majority and in a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the new map to stay in place while the case plays out, and experts say the highest court's decision ""sends a very strong signal.""  David Canon, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who focuses on redistricting, told CNN, ""It'll be harder for states to follow what we thought was settled law when it comes to creating minority-majority districts or even influence districts.""  ""It's going to be more of an uphill climb now for anyone to win a voting rights challenge,"" he added. Similar battles nationwide ""The sort of anti-democratic ideas that have infested a lot of Alabama decision makers are much more widespread,"" Wakeley said.  ""While we might be the sort of sandbox where these terrible policies come into play,"" he added, ""we're far from alone.""  Other states have also been accused of intentionally suppressing the vote of communities of color in their redistricting plans.  A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting powerMark Gaber, who litigates redistricting cases for the Campaign Legal Center, told CNN, ""It just seems, you know, that wherever the folks in power want to retain their power, they'll, you know, have no sort of shame about violating voting rights of minorities."" The Campaign Legal Center is a non-profit legal advocacy organization that has filed lawsuits against multiple states for racial and partisan gerrymandering.  Texas faces multiple lawsuits, including one filed by the Biden administration in December, for its congressional map, which the Justice Department says does not reflect the state's growth in minority population.  The state was awarded two additional congressional seats due to minority communities, who made up 95% of the state's overall population growth, but the Justice Department said Texas had drawn the map in a way that the two new seats would be decided by  majority-White voting populations.  The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit against Georgia last month on behalf of multiple advocacy groups, saying the state's new congressional map is ""its latest assault on the rights of Black voters and other voters of color to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and elect candidates of their choice.""The lawsuit alleges that Georgia, similarly to Alabama, packed voters of color into one district and spread out remaining voters of color to ensure they are the voting minority in two other districts.  ""We're in a very sort of unstable time in this landscape of voting rights law, and also just generally about elections in the country,"" Gaber said. ""And I think the last decade of experience in America proves that now more than ever we need protections for Black and Latino voters.""  "

About two-thirds of the reports this year allege violations of the federal mask mandate. The FAA said Wednesday it has referred a total of 80 incidents to the Justice Department to consider criminal prosecution.The spike in incidents has airlines calling for a government-coordinated ""no-fly list"" for passengers who create in-flight disturbances. Proponents say it would be separate from the existing government-run list that is part of the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database.   Airlines may ban an unruly passenger from their own flights, but competition rules mean that information is not shared with other carriers. CNN broke news of the industry's ask to the government in September, and Delta Air Lines renewed the request this month in a letter to the Justice Department.

Two passengers were charged this week with interfering with flight crew members after attempting to open aircraft exits in flight. In one of those incidents, four passengers helped American Airlines crewmembers subdue a passenger armed with plastic utensils and a wine bottle who was pulling on a door handle.  Buttigieg declined in a recent CNN interview to say whether the mask mandate will be allowed to expire in mid-March or whether it might be extended or lifted earlier.  ""When we have the guidance saying that is the right thing to do, I will be as relieved as any traveling American that we can move on to the next phase,"" he said.  The FAA's announcement that it has referred 80 incidents since the start of last year to the Justice Department marks about a doubling of referrals since President Joe Biden called for an increased role for the Justice Department in October. In November, the FAA said it had referred 37 cases for prosecution. Not all cases can be referred for prosecution and many of the cases referred to the FBI for criminal review involve physical assault on crew or passengers, and sexual assault or harassment cases on a passenger or crew, a FAA spokesperson said.The FAA called the issue a priority and said the agency, along with the FBI, are ""continuing to work together so unruly passengers face criminal prosecution when warranted."" The Transportation Security Administration is also revoking expedited screening privileges through the PreCheck program in some cases, the agencies said.  "

That's less than the 71% who reported working remotely in October 2020, but is well above the 23% who did frequently before the pandemic. And among those who have a workplace outside of their homes, the majority (61%) said they are choosing to work from home, while the remainder said they're remote because their workplace is closed or unavailable to them.Want to quit your job for a better gig? Here's your to-do listPew researchers said they found that 60% of workers with jobs that can be done from home say they'd like to work from home all or most of the time when the pandemic is over if given the choice. This is up from 54% in 2020.Why people currently are choosing to work at home rather than in the office is a key question, and there can be more than one reason. Forty-two percent cited fear of exposure to Covid-19 in the workplace -- that's down from 57% in 2020. But the biggest reason cited by respondents (76%) is that working from home is their preference. Read MoreFor some, geography plays a role: 17% (up from 9% in 2020) cite the fact that they have relocated as a main reason for not going to the office.And for working parents with kids under 18, Pew found a third (32%) cited lack of child care, while 15% said there are restrictions on their access to their workplace. Among people who rarely if ever worked from home before the pandemic and are choosing to do so now, 64% said working from home has improved their work-life balance. In terms of productivity, 44% say remote work has made it easier for them to get work done and meet deadlines. One common downside, however, is feeling less connected to colleagues, which 60% cited. The survey, conducted from January 24 to January 30, captures the views from a random, nationally representative sampling of 5,889 US adults who are working part-time or full-time and who have only one primary job.To see other findings from the survey, you can find the full Pew report is here."
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/success/financial-coach-workplace-benefit-feseries/index.html,What is a financial coach and who really needs one?,"By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN Business","Want help figuring out how to buy a home or pay down debt? Clueless about budgeting? Just want a second opinion on your decision to retire in a few years or start your own business? You might find it helpful to consult a financial coach. You may even have free access to one through your employer. There's a fair chance your company might offer financial coaching -- or will soon -- especially if you work for a large organization. That's because many employers are trying to beef up their benefits in a bid to attract and retain employees.Currently, 43% of employers say they offer ""personalized financial counseling, coaching or planning,"" and another 35% say they're thinking about doing so, according to research by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in partnership with HR benefits consulting firm Mercer and others.What does a financial coach do? Read MoreFinancial coaches can offer guidance on many types of money issues and help you improve your money habits.The role is part therapist and part financial guide, said Greg Ward, director of the finanical wellness research division of Financial Finesse, a coaching company that primarily serves the employees of Fortune 500 companies.We asked, you answered: The best financial advice you ever got A coach helps you meet your financial goals by gaining an understanding of your financial situation, money behaviors and personality. They can then provide helpful education and resources, and empower you to make decisions confidently.""[A coach's job] is to make sure the client understands their financial situation, and how it helps or harms them ... Then help them align their behavior with their financial vision,"" said Saundra Davis, founder of Sage Financial Solutions, which provides workplace financial coaching through Employee Assistance Programs, and also runs a financial coach certification program. What coaches don't do is manage your money, make decisions for you or recommend specific investments. What they might do, however, is help you navigate a set of options for your situation, and alert you to workplace benefits you may not know about. Or a coach might look at the funds in your employer's 401(k) plan, for instance, and indicate which ones best address your risk tolerance and time horizon.""I'll help you understand what would be appropriate. But I will not say put 10% of your contributions in Fund A,"" Ward said.Coaches at Financial Finesse don't sell any products to clients, which could be a potential conflict of interest for the coach, Ward said. For instance, a coach working for an insurance company may suggest one of its insurance products or may work for a 401(k) plan provider and recommend one of that company's IRA products. While the recommendation may be made in good faith, the coach could be blind to their bias. ""It is important for [you] to know how the coach is compensated and what potential conflicts of interest may exist.""At Brightside, which serves primarily Fortune 1000 companies, the financial ""assistants,"" as their coaches are called, don't sell products either. But they may research and present a number of potential solutions to address a client's current situation, said CEO Tom Spann. For instance, that could mean helping them find state-provided subsidies for child care. Or it could mean helping them find a short-term emergency loan at credit card rates rather than predatory loan rates. They could also help arrange for the employee to pay off the loan through their paychecks. If the lender of the chosen loan pays a fee to Brightside, Spann said, the fee is put into a savings account for the client, in what he calls a ""kick forward.""Then, when their loan is paid off, the client will have the option to continue putting at least part of what used to be their loan payment into a savings account to help them build a savings habit.What qualifies someone to be a financial coach?There's no universal set of requirements that must be met for a person to call themselves a financial coach, but many have related certifications, degrees or experience that help inform the work they do.At Financial Finesse, for instance, all the coaches are certified financial planners, which means they have to have a bachelor's degree, taken requisite coursework, passed a CFP exam and completed 4,000 or more hours of financial planning work before getting certified.At Brightside, about a third are CFPs and the rest are a combination of certified financial coaches, social workers or people who come with experience in other financial arenas such as student loans or credit counseling, Spann said.If your employer does provide financial coaching as a benefit, ask the person you're thinking of working with what qualifies them to be a coach and what areas they specialize in to make sure they will be a good fit for you. How it worksCoaches aim to have sustained contact with a client over time. But you decide the cadence of the relationship -- whether you want to check in with a coach weekly, monthly or not at all after a few sessions, Ward said.You also decide how you want to interact with the coach -- whether by phone, email, video call or on the digital app or online platform the coaching company may provide.Both Ward and Spann said the information clients share with their financial coaches is confidential and will not be shared with their employers. ""You can tell us about your gambling addiction. We would never disclose that,"" Spann said.It's a judgment-free experience, Ward added. ""There's often fear and shame that if I admit I don't know what I'm doing, I'm going to be judged. We're not going to judge a person."""
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/perspectives/inflation-cpi-economy-pandemic/index.html,Why inflation is about to peak,Opinion by Erik Lundh for CNN Business Perspectives ,"Erik Lundh is a principal economist at The Conference Board. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. 




Last year was a tough one for American consumers. Prices for just about everything, from eggs to used cars to electricity, crept higher, and by the end of the year were up 7% from a year earlier. Unfortunately, that number went even higher last month, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) hitting 7.5% year-over-year in January, a 40-year high. But there is good news: This alarmingly high inflation number should begin to drop soon.When the Omicron variant started to spread, it greatly disrupted the economy as millions of workers called in sick or quarantined. This exacerbated the inflation trends that we saw earlier in 2020. There weren't enough factory workers to make things, there weren't enough truck drivers to make deliveries, and there weren't enough clerks to restock shelves. This created shortages, which in turn jacked up prices on a range of goods, including milk, ham, dishware and even textbooks. I saw this when I went shopping last month. You probably did as well.  Meanwhile, demand for goods held up despite the recent Omicron wave. Recently published retail sales data showed strong consumer spending in January. This was consistent with The Conference Board's Present Situation Index, which gauges current consumer sentiment. The index showed rising spending intentions for large items, like homes, automobiles and major appliances. This willingness to spend made shortages (and price gains) that much more acute last month.However, with new Covid-19 cases plummeting, many of these disruptions should start to ease and allow supply to strengthen and better meet demand — meaning more modest inflation. That could make shopping for your summer wardrobe, buying a new grill and loading up on hamburger buns easier to stomach as the weather improves. With fewer people getting sick, there should be more workers in the transportation sector (truckers and dock workers, for instance) — helping to get goods from producers to consumers. Staffing disruptions at factories and on farms should improve as well. Furthermore, as more Americans feel comfortable spending on services, like going to the movies, to theme parks or to local restaurants, some of the elevated demand for goods seen over the course of the pandemic should come down a bit too. This should also help moderate inflation — provided that the service sector can handle the return of these customers.Read MoreHow we can solve the nation's affordable housing crisisTo be clear, the latest frighteningly high year-over-year inflation reading — the one that always makes headlines — will take some time to reflect these easing disruptions. That's because this annual number includes all of the month-over-month price gains we've seen over the last 12 months. So, it will take time for the math to catch up with the reality. I expect to see the annual inflation number start to tick down when the March CPI data is released. That said, some goods will indeed remain expensive for quite a while. New car prices, for instance, are unlikely to come down anytime soon. That's because of a global shortage in semiconductors, which will take some time to solve. Home prices will probably continue to rise as well, though perhaps at a slower rate. That's largely thanks to both rising demand from aging millennials and chronic underbuilding in the decade following the financial crisis.The reality is that the pandemic's impact on supply chains, energy prices, transportation costs and consumer spending patterns will take a year (or longer) to normalize. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's more hawkish stance on monetary policy will take time to implement and still more time to impact prices. Beyond that, other factors will likely keep inflation from falling back to pre-pandemic rates. Rapidly rising wages associated with labor market tightness, for instance, will be with us for quite some time. The good news is that consumers can take some solace knowing that large price increases won't go on forever. The pandemic seems to be easing, and high inflation will, too. "

us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/business/mercedes-eqe-amg/index.html,Mercedes reveals 677-horsepower electric performance sedan,"By Peter Valdes-Dapena, CNN Business"," (CNN)Mercedes' AMG performance division is most famous for making hand-built gasoline engines, but times are changing and electric motors are the new thing. Mercedes just unveiled its latest AMG model, the Mercedes-AMG EQE, a fully electric high-perfomance mid-size sedan.With two high-output electric motors engineered specifically for AMG -- one motor for the front wheels and one for the back wheels -- the Mercedes-AMG will be able to produce up to 677 horsepower when properly equipped. The Mercedes-AMG EQE has a more rounded shape than the brand's gas-powered cars.This performance model is based on the electric Mercedes EQE sedan that was revealed in the fall. Like other Mercedes EQ models, it's not a modified version of one of Mercedes' gasoline-powered cars, but is built from a specific electric-only engineering platform. Since there's no need to hold a gasoline engine under the hood, the EQE has a shorter hood than a gas-powered E-class and an overall more rounded shape.Since this electric AMG model won't have the brand's signature engine burble, dramatic sounds will be produced from speakers inside and outside the car. The interior sounds will vary depending on the mode the car is in and the way it's being driven, varying from a quiet hum to an aggressive rumble overlaid with jet sounds. There will also be a special ""event sound"" that plays as the car is locked. At night, the headlights will project animated patterns as the car is opened and closed.With electric motors generating large amounts of power with relative ease compared to gasoline engines, and the high price of batteries, the market for electric performance cars is already hot. With the Tesla Model S Plaid rocketing to highway speeds in two seconds, under ideal conditions, and automakers offering quick zero-emissions cars like the Porsche Taycan Turbo and Audi RS e-Tron GT, the Mercedes debuts as the latest battery-powered high-horsepower luxury car. It joins the even more powerful Mercedes-AMG EQS, a larger car capable of producing as much as 751 horsepower in a short burst Read MoreWhen equipped with an optional Dynamic Plus package, the AMG EQE's motors can briefly produce up to 677 horsepower in a Race Start acceleration mode that takes the car from zero to 60 miles an hour in an estimated 3.2 seconds. Otherwise, the motors' maximum output is 617 horsepower when driving in Sport+ mode. (That's also the maximum output in versions not equipped with the Dynamic Plus package.) That's more than double the horsepower of the more mainstream Mercedes EQE 350 electric car.The interior featurs Mercedes' full-width Hyperscreen/Mercedes-AMG's gasoline-powered cars also have all-wheel-drive, but the EQE's two-motor all-wheel-drive system allows for more precise control of the power going to the front or back wheels, according to Mercedes. Power distrubution will be more even in Comfort mode for greater efficiency but, in Sport modes, more power will be sent to the back wheels. Four-wheel steering will be standard on the AMG EQE. With this system, the car's back wheels turn in the opposite direction of the front wheels at low speeds allowing for tighter turns. At speeds above 37 miles an hour, all four wheels turn in the same direction for smoother lane changes. Automatically adjustable suspension will allow for a smoother ride or firmer control depending on the driving mode and situation. The car will also ride lower to the ground in Sport modes or when driving at very high speeds.A spoiler and air diffusers on at the back of the Mercedes-AMG EQE are designed to keep the back end pinned to the ground at high speeds.It will be available with Mercedes' so-called ""Hyperscreen,"" which covers the entire dashboard in a glass sheet that makes the entire area, from one side to the other, look as if it's one giant touchscreen. Actually, though, there are three separate screens underneath.The Mercedes-AMG EQE will go on sale early next year, the automaker said. The price of the car has not yet been announced."

world,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/europe/little-prince-manuscript-france-exhibition-intl/index.html,Paris exhibit brings 'The Little Prince' home,"By Xiaofei Xu and Anaëlle Jonah, CNN","Paris (CNN)""The Little Prince"" has arrived in Paris, nearly eight decades after it was written. The iconic novella was penned by French author Antoine de Saint-Exupery in New York during World War II, and now 30 handwritten pages of the original manuscript are on display at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. The original manuscript sits alongside hundreds of other items that celebrate many facets of the author's life and work. They include watercolors, sketches, drawings, photographs, poems, newspaper clippings and correspondence.  The exhibit, ""An Encounter with the Little Prince,"" opened Wednesday at Paris' Museum of Decorative Arts. ""The exhibition is called 'An Encounter with the Little Prince' and the goal is to really encounter Little Prince,"" Thomas Rivière, great-grandnephew of Saint-Exupery, told CNN.  ""It's been a dream (of mine) for such a long time,"" Rivière added.Read MoreBorn in the French city of Lyon in 1900, Saint-Exupery was a writer, pilot and journalist who joined the French air force in 1940. That year, he flew to New York on a mission to persuade the United States to enter the war and fight alongside France.  While in the United States, he finished writing ""Le Petit Prince,"" which was eventually published in New York in 1943 in both English and French. Some 600 items related to ""The Little Prince"" are featured in the exhibition.The simple tale, which has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide, is about a child who travels the universe gaining wisdom. Since its initial publication, it has been translated into nearly 500 languages, according to the Museum of Decorative Arts, making it one of the most translated works in the world.The best books of 2021, according to global tastemakersSaint-Exupery, however, did not live to see that reach. He went missing while flying a mission in 1944 and was declared dead in 1945. It took Rivière, who is the head of Saint-Exupery's estate, three years to bring the exhibition to the public -- partly because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. His efforts were supported by publishers and collectors, including the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, which houses the manuscript.Photographs, poems and newspaper cuttings about the book are featured in the exhibition.Saint-Exupery wrote and drew on razor-thin paper nicknamed ""onion skin."" This made the task of transporting the pages of the manuscript, which were all the more fragile due to their age, even more challenging, Rivière said.To ensure their safe transportation, the pages were carefully and professionally framed in New York by the Morgan Library and Museum, he said.The exhibition opened February 17 and is set to run through June 26.

Dudley hit England's north, Scotland's south and Northern Ireland on Wednesday, disrupting railways, roads and businesses with high winds and local flooding.Read MorePlane battling winds at Heathrow nearly topples overPeter Inness, a meteorologist at England's University of Reading, said that the back-to-back storms had formed as a result of a strong 200 mph jet steam blowing across the Atlantic Ocean. It is not unusual to see ""two or more damaging storms"" form in quick succession, he said in a statement. But what makes Eunice potentially ""rare"" and more potent is that it could evolve into a ""sting jet"" -- a ""narrow, focused region of extremely strong winds"" amid a ""larger area of strong winds.""The Met Office is urging people to only travel if ""necessary"" and warned drivers that road closures could be in place on Friday. People across the UK should also secure outdoor furniture and bins, and should avoid parking near trees.Severe storms more frequent Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey told CNN he expected Friday's storm to have ""high impacts,"" with flying debris and damage to homes likely. ""It's developing out in the Atlantic at present, [and] it's heading directly for the UK so to speak,"" he said. ""It will clear out of the UK over the course of Friday and travel towards Denmark and the Scandinavian countries.""Computer weather modelling shows extreme wind gusts will impact the UK Friday.Vautrey said that, while it was ""too early"" to say whether storms Dudley and Eunice were ""aided by climate change,"" such strong storms were becoming more common.""We've definitely seen the frequency of severe weather alter due to climate change,"" he said. High-elevation forests in the Rockies are burning more now than in the past 2,000 years""Global warming has led to changes in our weather patterns, and that is something we will increasingly have to take note of and be ready to deal with in the future.""Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, warned people not to take the red alert ""lightly.""""Red means you need to act now because there is an imminent danger to life,"" she said in a statement.""Winds of 70 mph will uproot trees, which can block roads and crush cars or buildings. They can pick up roof tiles and hurl them around.  If you're hit by one of those you will be seriously hurt or killed.  Wind that strong will sweep people and vehicles off streets, and topple electricity lines."""

The report, titled ""Financing and Genocide: Development Finance and the Crisis in the Uyghur Region,"" presents evidence that in recent years the IFC has loaned money to four Chinese companies that have been linked to forced labor and land expropriation in the region, along with environmental damage and the destruction of indigenous cultural heritage sites.According to public disclosures, the four companies named in the report — Chenguang Biotech Group, Camel Group, Century Sunshine and Jointown Pharmaceutical Group — have received loans and equity investments from the IFC valued at $439 million. Including loans sourced from institutional investors via the IFC, that figure rises to around $485 million.The loans could contravene the IFC's own internal guidelines — known as its Performance Standards — which function entirely to ""prevent IFC from financing projects that will have adverse environmental and social impacts that jeopardize [its] development aims,"" according to the report.

They say the four named companies are not the only businesses receiving IFC funds in the region.""I think it's clear that the IFC needs to divest from all their investments in the Uyghur region,"" said report author Laura Murphy, a professor in Human Rights and Contemporary Slavery at Sheffield Hallam University, who added that it is ""incumbent on the IFC based on their own standards that they ensure that their clients are not involved in forced labor.""I think it's clear that the IFC needs to divest from all their investments in the Uyghur regionLaura Murphy, Sheffield Hallam UniversityIn a statement, an IFC spokesperson told CNN the corporation has ""strong environment, social and governance (ESG) standards"" that are diligently applied during the life of the investment and are considered a model for development finance worldwide.""We do not tolerate discrimination or forced labor under any circumstances,"" the spokesperson said.

""The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of human rights and workers' rights and interests. For some time now, certain countries have been hyping up social lies and extending their reach to multilateral development institutions,"" Wang added. CNN sought comment from the four Chinese companies named in the report but did not receive a response. The report's authors also said they attempted to contact them but did not receive a response. Police officers patrolling the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China in 2018.'Punished with internment'Xinjiang has become a geopolitical hotspot because of the breadth of human rights abuses alleged to have taken place in the region, including what some Western governments have called the ""genocide"" of Uyghurs and other minorities. The US State Department has estimated that since 2017 up to two million members of religious and ethnic minorities have been imprisoned in a shadowy network of internment camps. China has described the facilities as ""vocational training centers"" where people learn job skills, Chinese language and laws, and officials declared in 2019 that such centers  — also aimed at deradicalizing local Muslims — had been closed down. They also claimed that the original detainees had graduated but that people were still enrolling to gain new skills. Western governments and human rights organizations have alleged that minorities in the region have been subjected to forced labor through job creation schemes run by the Chinese government to achieve ""poverty alleviation.""Workers who have participated in those job programs have told CNN that if they did not take the jobs they were offered, for a fraction of the usual rate of pay, they were warned they would be sent to camps.""The Chinese government has embarked on a massive campaign which they deem to be poverty alleviation,"" said Murphy of Sheffield Hallam. ""These programs are often non-consensual, and people who refuse can be punished with internment.""Such attempts to attack and smear China based on lies and disinformation are bound to failChinese government statementChina has consistently denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and told CNN in a statement prior to publication that claims of forced labor were lies created to smear its reputation.""China has repeatedly emphasized that the so-called issues of 'forced labor' and 'repression' against ethnic minorities are huge lies concocted by anti-China forces in the US and the West. They are entirely baseless.

It is part of the World Bank Group and says it provided roughly $31.5 billion in loans and other financial assistance — including nearly $12 billion in ""fragile, conflict-affected, and poverty-stricken countries"" — last fiscal year to private companies and financial institutions in emerging and developing economies around the world.The IFC spokesperson told CNN its mission is to ""fight poverty by helping the private sector thrive."" ""In doing so, we create jobs and raise living standards, especially for the poor and vulnerable,"" the spokesperson said.But its investments have been criticized for years by charities that accuse the IFC of sometimes causing more harm than good by failing to carry out due diligence. In 2015, Oxfam International published a report compiled with input from several NGOs that claimed the IFC sent billions of dollars in ""out of control"" investments to third parties that caused ""human rights abuses around the world.""IFC said at the time that it was working with its clients to resolve issues raised by Oxfam and other civil society organizations and that it valued any insights into those concerns. The organization also said that it took additional efforts to train its staff and be more selective about its clients and was strengthening oversight and supervision. The World Bank Group had been acknowledging concerns even prior to that report. In 2013, the organization's Independent Evaluation Group highlighted declining ""outcome ratings"" for IFC-financed projects and advised the IFC to focus on ""supervision"" and ""enhancing the quality of projects"" through ""intensified efforts.""CNN approached the World Bank Group for comment about the Helena Kennedy Centre's findings, and a spokesperson directed CNN to the IFC's response.The World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C. Alleged connections to forced labor The four Chinese companies with ties to Xinjiang named in the Helena Kennedy Centre report work in sectors ranging from food to pharmaceuticals and energy. Using corporate documents, stock exchange filings, Chinese state media reports, IFC disclosures and satellite imagery, the report claims these companies have ties to parts of the region where allegations of forced labor are rampant. In some cases, the report says these companies have participated in state-endorsed ""labor transfer"" or ""poverty alleviation"" schemes, which international human rights organizations and foreign governments have for years claimed perpetuate forced labor in the region. CNN has independently verified that the four companies named in the Helena Kennedy Centre report have all received loans from the IFC in recent years. At least two of those loans, made to Camel Group and Jointown Pharmaceutical, have been used to finance projects in Xinjiang. Because the firms are all publicly traded on Chinese stock exchanges, corporate filings detail some of their dealings in the region. Chinese state media reports also explain some of their work, while the IFC's own records shed some light on the organization's involvement in providing financing to these firms. One company, Chenguang Biotech Group, makes food additives, natural dyes and pigments, and sources its raw materials primarily from India and Xinjiang. In Xinjiang, the company is involved in the production of marigolds.The IFC, which loaned Chenguang $40 million in 2019 so the company could increase production, conducted an assessment that found the company's risk of being implicated in forced labor with respect to marigold growers to be ""low"" and that overall ""the risks in Chenguang's primary supply chain are low to medium."" But according to the Helena Kennedy Centre report, Chenguang sources some of its workforce from ""coercive"" state-sponsored labor and land transfer programs. The report claims that in some cases farmers have no say in whether to participate in major farming projects, or what they want to plant. Companies, too, are under pressure to support state programs.JUST WATCHED'How can we feel safe?': Uyghur on Chinese government policyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'How can we feel safe?': Uyghur on Chinese government policy 03:55Citing an official press release, the report said that, in one case, the paramilitary organization Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), which controls the region economically and politically, conducted ""ideological work"" on those who expressed reluctance about changing their farming methods, which the report described as a method of ""coercing"" minorities. Those people are encouraged by government agencies to ""relinquish their land, change their crops, alter their farming methods, work for cooperatives or large-scale farms that have expropriated their lands, or move to factory labor,"" the report said. Another company, the battery maker Camel Group, received nearly $36 million in funding from the IFC in July 2019 to expand its battery recycling operations in parts of China, including Xinjiang, according to IFC documents. Chinese corporate records also show the company has at least two subsidiaries in the region.An IFC risk assessment did acknowledge ""potentially significant adverse environmental or societal risks"" on account of smelting waste lead but added that Camel promised the organization it would promote the hiring of more local minority residents in Xinjiang.  IFC also assessed that ""no forced labor practices"" are used by Camel Group and that its battery suppliers are subject to quarterly audits by the company to ensure they are complaint with child and forced labor inspections.However, the Helena Kennedy Centre report cited government press releases that it says show Camel has benefited from state-sponsored labor transfer programs. In July 2017, according to one government release, 165 laborers were taken across Xinjiang for a 10-day long ""closed pre-job training,"" which the report authors say was an indication that their movements were restricted. During that time, according to a government press release, the participants received ""military and ideological training,"" and ""were required to sing patriotic songs"" and learn Mandarin Chinese — measures that human rights organizations worry can lead to the erasure of culture for Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz in Xinjiang. Those groups speak languages closer to Turkish than Mandarin Chinese. Before the laborers were dispatched to their assigned companies — one of which was Camel — they were made to attend a flag-raising ceremony, affirm their loyalty to the ruling Chinese Communist Party and pledge to ""make due contributions to national security, national unity, social stability and harmony,"" according to the government press release. A third company, the fertilizer and materials firm Century Sunshine Group, received $165 million from the IFC between 2014 and 2016, according to IFC documents.  That figure includes $125 million to upgrade a fertilizer manufacturing facility in Jiangsu province, north of Shanghai on China's eastern coast. As of December 2020, IFC had roughly a 17% stake in the company, according to an annual report from Century Sunshine.Century Sunshine also has ties to Xinjiang. The report cited local state-run media from December 2017 that said the company's Xinjiang subsidiary took in 10 rural laborers from a township in eastern Xinjiang through state-sponsored labor transfer programs. Two years later, that same subsidiary was one of nine firms that participated in a state-backed labor recruitment event that encouraged off-season farmers to work for industrial manufacturing facilities in the area — an event involving labor transfer the report's authors said was at ""high risk""of violating standards for labor and working conditions.The final company implicated in the report, Jointown Pharmaceutical, received nearly $200 million in debt financing from the IFC in the last few years, according to IFC documents. IFC assessed their investments in Jointown Pharmaceutical as having ""limited"" environmental or social risks.The company — which distributes personal protection equipment, medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs — received nearly $150 million in July 2019 to build distribution centers and upgrade four warehouses in middle and western China, including Xinjiang. In October 2020, Jointown Pharmaceutical received another $50 million to buy pharmaceutical products and expand distribution because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Like Camel and Century Sunshine, the Helena Kennedy Centre report alleges that Jointown Pharmaceutical has participated in Xinjiang-related labor transfer programs. The report cited an article published in December 2020 by the Xinjiang Food and Drug Administration on its official WeChat account that said Jointown Pharmaceutical acknowledged receiving ""more than 200"" workers ""transferred"" from southern Xinjiang and other remote and underdeveloped prefectures through the labor programs. The report also said that Jointown Pharmaceutical has ""many"" facilities in Xinjiang that are located next to buildings identified as internment camps by the Australian Strategy Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think tank. One of Jointown Pharmaceutical's facilities in the regional capital of Urumqi, for example, is in one of the city's ""largest prison districts,"" according to the report.Efforts to monitor investments in XinjiangWhile travel to Xinjiang by foreign organizations has become almost impossible in recent years, the Helena Kennedy Centre report says the IFC paid a one-day visit to the region in 2019, during the height of the government crackdown there.Report co-author Kendyl Salcito, the Executive Director of human rights research non-profit NomoGaia, told CNN she spoke via phone to an IFC representative who went on the trip. The employee told Salcito that their group was temporarily detained by police three times within a roughly 24-hour period, adding that the atmosphere was very uncomfortable and they wanted to leave quickly.The IFC continued to fund projects in the region after that visit, as seen in IFC documents reviewed by the report authors and by CNN. In November 2020, Salcito said, the IFC told her that it did not have alternative arrangements for monitoring projects there. The IFC did not respond to CNN's questions about Salcito's account of the trip. However, the spokesperson told CNN that in the last two years the IFC has dedicated more resources to supervising companies it works with in Xinjiang.""While accessing projects on the ground has been more difficult for all development actors in the last two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, IFC has dedicated more resources to supervising the companies we work with regarding adherence to our ESG standards. These standards are legally binding, include protections for workers, communities, and the environment, and expressly prohibit discrimination and the use of forced labor,"" the spokesperson said. Paramilitary police vehicles on a road in Artux in China's northwest Xinjiang region in June, 2019.The IFC has taken some steps to withdraw from the region. It ceased its relationships with three other Chinese firms that ""were engaged or sourcing from companies engaged in repression in the Uyghur Region,"" according to the report. The IFC did not respond to CNN's questions about why it chose to divest those companies and not others. In 2020, the IFC told Salcito in email exchanges viewed by CNN that the Chinese companies it works with assured the organization they did not use any forced labor. The IFC did not respond to CNN's questions about that correspondence. The Helena Kennedy Centre report authors say that form of self-reporting is wholly insufficient. ""The continued willingness to provide financing in the region, without any direct oversight, indicates that its investment strategy in the region continues to overlook the ongoing crimes against humanity and Performance Standards violations that render the IFC's investments complicit,"" the report said. A lack of due diligenceMultinational corporations have for years found it difficult to perform due diligence on their supply chains linked to Xinjiang because of limited access, surveillance and the threat of government interference. That makes the use of publicly available records and satellite imagery all the more important in determining whether a firm has ties to forced labor in the region. Satellite images, for example, have shown that detention facilities are often built up simultaneously alongside factories and business parks, which human rights activists say is a clear indication that factory workers are being drawn from the prison or camp population.Maxar satellite imagery of a re-education internment camp in
Hotan, Xinjiang, China.Some companies, investors and other organizations have pulled out of the region because of the difficulties in auditing activity there. Many international auditors will no longer certify products made in Xinjiang, and the Fair Labor Association —  a Washington-based non-profit whose members include multinational corporations and Ivy League universities — has banned its members from sourcing from Xinjiang due to an inability to gather accurate information, or to verify if workers there are under duress.""The underlying problem in the Uyghur region is the political repression is so great, we're of the view that no company can do adequate human rights due diligence,"" said Sophie Richardson, China Director of Human Rights Watch. ""Where  [a company] can't do adequate human rights due diligence, it should withdraw.""Foreign governments have also been piling pressure on companies.

The United States, after all, has plowed more than $23 billion over the last 20 years into the World Bank Group, and as of June 2021 was the largest IFC shareholder with a stake of about 21%. That funding has increased during the pandemic: In March 2020, the World Bank Group announced that the US government authorized a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.In a statement to CNN, the US Treasury Department said that it ""works closely with other parts of the United States government to strongly condemn and respond to the atrocities taking place in Xinjiang.""It said the government had pressed multilateral development banks (MDBs) — including the IFC — to strengthen their safeguards so projects ""do not inadvertently support companies that participate in or benefit from forced labor.""The statement added: ""The US has been — and will continue to be -— a lead voice on this issue in all the MDBs and will continue working with other shareholder countries to make companies with alleged linkages to forced labor practices ineligible for MDB investments."""

La Monica, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is on a major shopping spree.The company's planned purchase of video game maker Activision Blizzard, with a price tag of nearly $70 billion, is Microsoft's biggest and boldest acquisition. But it's hardly the only notable deal in the Nadella era.Microsoft (MSFT) scooped up advertising tech business Xandr from CNN owner AT&T (T) late last year for a reported $1 billion. The company also shelled out nearly $20 billion for cloud software firm Nuance earlier in 2021. That's on top of numerous other billion dollar deals Microsoft has made since Nadella took the helm in 2014, including the acquisitions of Minecraft developer Mojang, Bethesda games studio owner ZeniMax Media, open source coding site GitHub and business social media network LinkedIn. The LinkedIn deal was previously Microsoft's largest, with a value of $26.2 billion.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway perfectly timed an out-of-left-field investmentNow there are reports Microsoft is looking to buy Mandiant, the cybersecurity software firm formerly known as FireEye that is currently valued at about $4.5 billion. Read MoreMandiant CEO Kevin Mandia said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts last week that it won't comment on rumors or speculation. Microsoft had no comment either.It should come as no surprise that Microsoft might be looking to use some of the massive amount of cash it has on its balance sheet to close some deals. Microsoft has about $130 billion, and would still have around $60 billion left over after the Activision deal closes...assuming it is approved by regulators. The cybersecurity business is a major area of focus for Nadella. Last year, Microsoft bought several security startups, including CloudKnox Security, RiskIQ and CyberX. Security is a lucrative business for Microsoft since it generates a large chunk of recurring annual subscription revenue. It also helps Microsoft attract more corporate customers for its other numerous, cloud-based subscription software offerings.  So even if a Mandiant deal doesn't happen, Microsoft will likely set its sights elsewhere in the same space.""Cybercrime is the number one threat facing every business today,"" Nadella said during Microsoft's most recent earnings call with analysts last month. He added that cybersecurity revenue for Microsoft topped $15 billion over the past 12 months, a 45% jump from the previous year.Flush with cash, big companies are ready to buy up rivals and reward investorsMicrosoft chief financial officer Amy Hood also noted on a conference call with analysts following the Activision deal announcement that the company is looking for more deals in high-growth markets where Microsoft can ""uniquely add value to the users or the community."" She didn't name any industries that the company might be targeting. Microsoft isn't the only tech company on the hunt for deals. With interest rates likely headed higher over the next few months, other cash-rich tech firms may be propelled into action. Two others already have. Intel (INTC) announced Tuesday that it was buying Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) for $5.4 billion in cash. IBM (IBM) said Tuesday it was purchasing Neudesic, a cloud services consulting firm. Terms were not disclosed.And there are reports that Cisco Systems (CSCO) has made a $20 billion offer for Big Data firm Splunk (SPLK)."

That's less than the 71% who reported working remotely in October 2020, but is well above the 23% who did frequently before the pandemic. And among those who have a workplace outside of their homes, the majority (61%) said they are choosing to work from home, while the remainder said they're remote because their workplace is closed or unavailable to them.Want to quit your job for a better gig? Here's your to-do listPew researchers said they found that 60% of workers with jobs that can be done from home say they'd like to work from home all or most of the time when the pandemic is over if given the choice. This is up from 54% in 2020.Why people currently are choosing to work at home rather than in the office is a key question, and there can be more than one reason. Forty-two percent cited fear of exposure to Covid-19 in the workplace -- that's down from 57% in 2020. But the biggest reason cited by respondents (76%) is that working from home is their preference.

Among people who rarely if ever worked from home before the pandemic and are choosing to do so now, 64% said working from home has improved their work-life balance. In terms of productivity, 44% say remote work has made it easier for them to get work done and meet deadlines. One common downside, however, is feeling less connected to colleagues, which 60% cited.

world,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/investing/ponzi-scheme-explained-zachary-horwitz/index.html,"Hollywood actor's Ponzi scheme, explained: Why investors keep falling for scams","By Allison Morrow, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)The tale of Zachary Horwitz made headlines this week after he was sentenced to 20 years for bilking investors out of $650 million by peddling bogus licensing deals with HBO and Netflix. Ironically, it is just the kind of juicy swindler story you might binge watch on those platforms: Horwitz, a 35-year-old actor who had bit roles in a handful of low-budget films over the past decade, pleaded guilty last fall to committing federal securities fraud and running an illegal operation known as a Ponzi scheme. For years, prosecutors say, Horwitz used his investors' money to fund a lavish Hollywood lifestyle — until his scam unraveled. Ponzi schemes, explainedIn short, a Ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud that uses money from new investors to pay off earlier ones. The term comes from the 1920 swindler Charles Ponzi, but in recent years has become synonymous with the crimes of Bernie Madoff, the mastermind behind the largest financial fraud in history, who died in prison last year. Read MoreAlthough Ponzi schemes have a long history, they are far from a bygone threat, experts say. In fact, they remain a major risk to investors in an era of soaring stock markets and wild surges in newfangled assets like NFTs and cryptocurrency.""Fraudsters really feed on times of uncertainty, financial distress, upheaval, times of change, and those are really the times that we've been living in the past few years,"" says Kathy Bazoian Phelps, a lawyer who runs a blog about Ponzi schemes. ""And of course there's a lot of money out there people are looking to invest.Horwitz's case appears to check the major boxes for a Ponzi scheme: They're typically perpetrated by (a) men who (b) promise steadily high returns with minimal risk and (c) often prey on friends and family to get the scam off the ground.  Early investors in a Ponzi scheme get rewarded with mindbogglingly large dividends — Horwitz allegedly promised returns between 25% and 45% — that propel them to tell others about the golden opportunity, which keeps new money flowing into the scam. Once the pool of new investment dries up, of course, the fraud falls apart. A fraud is bornProsecutors say Horwitz, who goes by the stage name Zach Avery, promised his investors — many of whom were friends — that their money would be used to buy film distribution rights that he would then license to streaming platforms for a profit. ""But, as his victims came to learn, [Horwitz] was not a successful businessman or Hollywood insider,"" prosecutors said. ""He just played one in real life."" (Savage burn, prosecutors.) Horwitz's company ""neither acquired film rights nor entered into any distribution agreements with HBO or Netflix"" and he provided fake documents to his investors. HBO, like CNN, is part of WarnerMedia.Horwitz instead routed the funds to his own accounts, shelling out $5.7 million on a house and splurging on trips to Vegas on private jets, according to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.It's not hard to imagine how an investor might be sucked into such a scam in the era of meme stock rallies and overnight cryptocurrency millionaires. The fear of missing out is a powerful tool for grifters.Phelps, who wrote ""The Ponzi Book: A Legal Resource for Unraveling Ponzi Schemes,"" says people often rely too much on word of mouth without due diligence to determine whether an investment is legitimate. That can be especially true when it comes to schemes involving cryptocurrencies or artificial intelligence. ""All it takes is for somebody to represent that they have the proprietary algorithm that guarantees returns and that sounds pretty technical and fancy and like a sure thing,"" she said. ""That feels comfortable to people because somebody knows technically what they're talking about, supposedly, and the outcome is a guaranteed return that's much higher than something they're going to find somewhere else.""In fact, the SEC is particularly worried that the rise of cryptos ""may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes"" in part by promising investors an opportunity to ""get in on the ground floor of a growing internet phenomenon."" The agency cited a 2013 case in which an alleged Ponzi scheme advertised a bitcoin ""investment opportunity"" in an online forum. Investors were promised up to 7% interest per week, and that their funds would be used for bitcoin arbitrage. Instead, the crypto funds were used to pay existing investors and exchanged into US dollars to pay the organizer's personal expenses.Even professional investors can fall victim to fraud, Phelps notes, but there are several ways to avoid getting taken for a ride. Step one is simply being mindful of the potential for fraud. ""I'm not even sure if that crosses people's minds at all,"" she said. Beyond that, investors need to ask due diligence questions, beware of promises of guaranteed return with no risk and watch out for returns that are higher than what you're likely to find in the marketplace. ""If you can't really understand what the investment is after a five-minute explanation,"" Phelps says, ""you probably shouldn't be investing in it."""

Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"By Amy Chillag, CNN "," (CNN)If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it.  Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study.  But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014. If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.  Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development. The most effective way to tackle climate change? Plant 1 trillion trees""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said. Read MoreMore than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says. ""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region."" The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation. Why you should be forest bathing (and we don't mean shampoo)The lost value amounted to $96 million a year. Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society: Heat reduction: Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings, parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere. Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up."" Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil. Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams. Noise reduction:  Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits. Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says. Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property. Improved human health:  Many studies have found connections between exposure to nature and better mental and physical health. Some hospitals have added tree views and plantings for patients as a result of these studies. Doctors are even prescribing walks in nature for children and families due to evidence that nature exposure lowers blood pressure and stress hormones. And studies have associated living near green areas with lower death rates. Wildlife habitat:  Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life. Planning for treesGardening becomes healing with horticultural therapyNowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways."" Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being."" Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""'America's Amazon' is at risk The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.  ""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""How you can help stop tree loss Protect what you have:  Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true."" Prune the dead limbs out of your trees:  If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said. Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice. Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary:  Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow."" Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards  and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control. Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

world,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/11/us/miami-little-haiti-climate-gentrification-weir-wxc/index.html,Miami's Little Haiti wasn't a target for developers. Until the seas started to rise. ,"By Bill Weir, CNN Climate Correspondent","Miami (CNN)In a city where ""sunny day floods"" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of ""location, location, location."" In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable. READ: Millions of US homes at risk of chronic flooding this century, study saysRead MoreEven now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed. ""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are. Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president. Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach. They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere. ""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.  After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation. A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy. ""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them."" He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level. What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead, where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind. Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.

world,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/health/rich-people-climate-change-intl/index.html,How rich people could help save the planet from climate change,"By Stephanie Bailey, CNN"," (CNN)Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints. The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change.Read: While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by itRead MoreBut some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference. Spend wiselyThe buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.    ""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.German architects  Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics?Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes. ""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities. ""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods. DivestmentAs well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in. Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany. But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment. Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest. Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies. Watch: Why climate change worries the world's largest companies""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto. And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""  Wealth means power Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers. There is more CO2 in the atmosphere today than any point since the evolution of humansOtto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.  ""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.Fund climate researchThe wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy. Can coral farms save our reefs?In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues. ""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action:  A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years. Role models The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions. ""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters. Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.

Sign up here.For followers of freestyle skiing and fashion alike, the buzz surrounding Winter Olympian Eileen Gu at this year's Games has come as little surprise.The 18-year-old's gold medal performance in the big air competition thrust her into the global spotlight Tuesday, sparking such a furor in China that social media platform Weibo crashed under the weight of interest. But Gu has spent years establishing herself as both a top athlete and a hugely bankable model who appeals to brands in both Asia and the West.In 2021, as she won gold medals at the skiing World Championships and Winter X Games, Gu was also forging lucrative partnerships with fashion houses and luxury labels. Signing for IMG Models, the agency representing Bella Hadid, Kate Moss and Hailey Bieber, she has penned deals with Louis Vuitton, Victoria's Secret and Tiffany & Co., as well as the luxury Swiss watchmaker IWC and cosmetics brand Estée Lauder, among others.In fact, the California-born athlete is among the most heavily sponsored athletes at these Olympics. She arrived in Beijing with more than 20 commercial partnerships, ranging from Beats by Dre headphones to Cadillac.A promotional image from Gu's recent campaign with Louis Vuitton.  Credit: Louis VuittonBut it is Gu's mass appeal in China, where she is known by her Chinese name Gu Ailing and has been nicknamed the ""Snow Princess,"" that makes her especially valuable to brands.For the Year of the Tiger, can luxury fashion change its stripes?Having switched her sporting allegiance to her mother's home country in 2019, Gu's fluency in Mandarin has helped secure her place on Chinese TV ads, billboards and even milk cartons (as the face of Inner Mongolia-based Mengniu Dairy). E-commerce giant JD.com, cafe chain Luckin Coffee and telecoms firm China Mobile are among the growing list of mainland brands that she's modeled for in recent months.China is on track to become the world's largest luxury market by 2025, according to consulting firm Bain. The Asian edition of marketing and advertising industry magazine Campaign estimated that new endorsements there could be earning the athlete around 15 million yuan ($2.5 million) apiece -- and that was before her gold-medal success.Eileen Gu seen on a JD.com advertisement at a bus stop in Beijing, China. Credit: Tingshu Wang/ReutersAccording to Bohan Qiu, whose Shanghai-based creative agency Boh Project works with major fashion brands, Gu's surging popularity in the country comes at a time when nationalist pride in China has seen ""the relevance of Western celebrities"" decrease.""For this generation, a lot of the celebrities here are quite domestic-oriented -- so (Gu) being half-American half-Chinese, and speaking both languages fluently, has a very global appeal,"" he said over the phone, adding that the country's Gen Z demographic contains ""third culture kids"" who simultaneously understand Chinese and Western contexts. ""She is definitely a once-in-a-decade type of talent.""Ai Weiwei helped design Beijing's Olympic stadium. But he regrets how it's being used todayGu has coupled big-money deals with reputable magazine features and appearances at A-list fashion shows. Spotted at events like Paris Fashion Week as far back as 2019, she has since been seen on Louis Vuitton's front row and the notoriously exclusive Met Gala, where she arrived on the red carpet wearing a Carolina Herrera bubble dress.""The fashion world has helped balance my training,"" she told Vogue Hong Kong, appearing on the cover of the magazine's July issue. ""Just like skiing, modeling requires incredible expression and personality. It requires creativity, confidence, and the ability to learn and adapt... The transition between modeling and skiing became a break and a practice for each other that helped me eventually feel more motivated in each area.""Eileen Gu pictured with Stacy Martin (left) and Venus Williams (right) at the Louis Vuitton Womenswear Spring/Summer 2022 show at Paris Fashion Week last October. Credit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty ImagesGu has also appeared on the cover of Chinese editions of GQ and Elle. And as guest editor of Vogue China's Gen-Z-focused bimonthly issue, Vogue+, the athlete recently explored the complexities of her identity under the theme ""code switch.""""I wanted to explore and showcase the inherently malleable nature of adolescent identities, Gu wrote on Instagram, ""a quality I've found myself tapping into time and time again as I display different facets of myself (athlete, model, student, Chinese, American, teenager, writer, public persona, etc) in different environments. Everyone code switches, and I think it's time we start celebrating that multifaceted nature.""The skiing star guest-edited an issue of Vogue China's Gen-Z-focused bimonthly issue, Vogue+. A 'safe bet' for brandsGu's social media is also littered with fashion. Whether posting to Instagram or writing to millions of followers on Xiaohongshu and Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Instagram and Twitter, respectively), her feeds flit between sport and style, with pictures from the slopes posted alongside modeling shots and her latest fashion editorials.Her unguarded approach has helped her connect with young fans, in both China and the West, who want to see ""above and beyond the training, the sports, the more official side of things,"" said Qiu. ""A lot of Chinese celebrities are much more protected by their agent or management, or they have a hard time sharing the more real sides of their lives.""Under Xi's rule, what is China's image of the 'ideal' man?Shortly after last Friday's opening ceremony, Gu posted a ""lookbook"" of outfits she had worn at the Games so far. Elsewhere, she has shared messages support from supermodel Karlie Kloss and a viral video of her unboxing gear from Chinese sportswear brand Anta for an impromptu fashion show in the Olympic village.""My god, that vest and down jacket give off supermodel vibes,"" wrote one user beneath the latter video on the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin. ""The Frog Princess is so fashionable,"" read a comment on another video, using another Chinese nickname given to Gu on account of a green ski helmet she wore as a child. ""Cheering you on to be the best at the Winter Olympics.""An advertising billboard shows Eileen Gu promoting the Chinese dairy company Mengniu Dairy. Credit: Noel Celis/AFP/Getty ImagesEven in the heat of competition, Gu has used her public platform to boost her fashion credentials and promote Chinese culture. Speaking to reporters after qualifying for the big air final on Monday, she pulled up her race bib to show the cameras a black jacket embroidered with a golden dragon. ""This is a piece of clothing I designed, with Chinese elements,"" she said in Mandarin.Gu's ascent comes at a time when Western labels frequently find themselves subjected to consumer boycotts for perceived missteps -- everything from casting models that don't fit Chinese beauty standards to printing T-shirts listing Hong Kong and Macau as countries, rather than cities. Her refusal to be drawn on political matters may bolster her reputation as a low-risk ambassador.The skier has remained tight-lipped on the many controversies surrounding China at these Games, including Beijing's alleged treatment of Xinjiang's Uyghur population and concerns over the well-being of tennis star Peng Shuai. Can China look past counterfeits and superstition in its burgeoning second-hand fashion market?""There's no need to be divisive,"" she recently told the New York Times after saying she would ""pass"" on questions about China. ""I think everything I do, it's all about inclusivity.""Asked about Peng at a press conference this week, Gu simply welcomed her attendance and expressed gratitude that the tennis player was ""happy and healthy and out here doing her thing again."" Gu has also dodged questions about whether she was forced her to forfeit her US passport, as China does not formally recognize dual citizenship.Related video: Reporters press Eileen Gu over her citizenship. See her response Her diplomatic approach echoes that of tennis star Emma Raducanu, who also won praise from state media and trended on Weibo after winning the US Open last year. (She too has a Chinese mother and has addressed fans on social media in Mandarin). Raducanu has since signed with the likes of Dior, with talent manager Jonathan Shalit, telling CNN last year that he expected her to make ""well over $100 million"" in sponsorship deals in 2022. But unlike the tennis star, who continues to represent the UK, Gu's decision to ski for China makes her an even more bankable name, according to Qiu.""Sports heroes are definitely the new idols here,"" Qiu said, adding: ""They're national heroes, which makes them a very safe bet for brands to work with.""Top image: Eileen Gu in a campaign for Louis Vuitton.

But the Swiss brand's reputation has taken an unexpected turn in recent years. Namedropping luxury labels may be nothing new in hip-hop, but lyrical references to Patek Phillippe exploded in 2017. That year, one-third of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100 mentioned the brand, according to music website Genius. Travis Scott has rapped about his ""two-tone Patek,"" Cardi B (pictured top) ""flooded"" hers with diamonds and Gucci Mane suggested that his was ""gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me."" Young Thug, Migos and Future have all mentioned their Patek Philippe timepieces, while Lil Uzi Vert has such affinity with the watchmaker that he released two tracks honoring it, ""Patek"" and ""New Patek."" (""New Patek on my wrist,"" he said in the latter, ""white diamonds, them sh**s hit pink."") The phenomenon coincided with a wider surge of interest in watch collecting, according to Nick Marino, senior vice president of content at online watch magazine, Hodinkee.""Since Patek Phillipe has always has been one of the most prestigious watch brands, it stood to reason that it would be the one that everyone was talking about,"" he said via video call. ""Hip-hop has a long and storied history of shouting out brands that artists like, going back to 'My Adidas' by Run-DMC, and it just so happened that watches caught fire.Rapper Future sports a Patek Philippe watch at the UNCF Mayor's Masked Ball in 2016.

You might expect rappers to talk about Richard Mille, because that's a young, flashy, 'new money' watch brand -- and rappers love that one too -- but I love that they love the old-money watch brands. ""By positioning themselves as Patek customers, rappers are positioning themselves in the lineage of elites going all the way back to the 19th century. That's power.""The Broker, The Astronaut and The Vampire: Enter the mysterious world of Soviet watch collectorsThe brand's place in pop culture is a far cry from its 1990s ""Generations"" ads, which featured predominantly White parents and their children bonding over treasured horological heirlooms. The memorable campaign helped establish the famous catchphrase, ""You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation."" As a brand that promotes history and heritage as markers of quality, becoming a status symbol for the Instagram generation might have sat uncomfortably with the 182-year-old company. But, Marino said, the watchmaker has not visibly repositioned its brand -- nor need it worry about becoming too popular: ""In a lot of ways, the young audience -- the hip-hop audience -- has found Patek maybe rather than the other way around.""This brand has been a symbol of luxury since 1839, so I don't think there's any danger of them being seen as a flash in the pan,"" he said, adding: ""Twenty-seventeen was a lifetime ago in hip-hop, and people are still talking about these watches.""A watch from the Nautilus range, which contains some of Patek Philippe's most sought after models, on display at 2019 Baselworld luxury watch and jewelry fair in Basel, Switzerland.

""But recently, it's all the younger generation -- the second or third generation (down) from the first collector clients we had. Quilty pleasure: Why your grandmother's quilt is today's luxury fashion staple""Their collecting style and the types (of watches they're interested in) are quite different. In the past, experienced collectors looked for the most complicated versions of products. Nowadays, they tend to go for simpler functions -- something simple-looking or made from different materials. Whereas in the past 80% of our Patek Philippe watches we sold were (made from) precious metals, now, most customers are requesting the stainless-steel ones."" ""Rarely, do (the watches) really just go down to the next generation,"" she added. ""But it is a brand that connects the generations together."" More money, fewer complicationsCelebrities' fixation with Patek Philippe may just reflect its status as the world's most expensive watchmaker -- if auction records are your measure, at least. The brand is responsible for eight of the 10 priciest watches ever to go under the hammer, including a stainless-steel Reference 1518 that fetched over 11 million Swiss francs ($11.1 million) and a pink gold version that smashed estimates to sell for almost $9.6 million last September.

That record was comprehensively smashed five years later by an unworn Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime 6300A-010, created especially for a charity auction in Geneva, that fetched 31 million Swiss francs ($31.2 million).Founded in Geneva as Patek, Czapek & Cie (the current name was adopted after Polish co-founder Antoni Norbert Patek partnered with Frenchman Adrien Philippe), the brand claims to have been making watches ""without interruption"" since 1839. Queen Victoria was among the watchmaker's early clients, purchasing one of its ""keyless"" watches -- the first in the world to operate without prior winding -- at London's Great Exhibition in 1851.

In 1868, the company produced what it believes to be the world's first wristwatch for the Hungarian Countess Koscowicz (a claim hotly disputed by rival Breguet, which says a 1810 timepiece it made for the Queen of Naples was the world's first). Patek Philippe has since been awarded over 100 patents, from the first perpetual calendar mechanism for pocket watches to ""time zone"" watches that featured a second hour hand for international jet-setters.But its most exclusive range has proven to be one of its least complicated: the Nautilus. The incredible stories behind 5 of the world's most expensive watchesDesigned to resemble a ship's porthole, Nautilus watches cost upwards of $30,000 each, with prices on the secondary market often significantly higher. Following popular ranges like 1932's Calatrava, the collection launched in 1976 and has been worn not only by royalty and rappers, but business moguls, athletes and Hollywood stars. More recently, Drake has shown off his emerald-laden Patek Philippe Nautilus Reference 5726, custom-designed by late fashion designer Virgil Abloh, while Kylie Jenner is regularly pictured sporting a white gold diamond-encrusted Nautilus Reference 5719. The Nautilus also makes regular appearances on Instagram, ranging from the subtle (see John Mayer wearing his in a mirror selfie) to the not-so-suble (see reality star Scott Disick waiting outside a then-unopened Patek Philippe store alongside the caption, ""What time ya opening @patekphilippe?"").It is the stainless-steel Nautilus Reference 5711, in particular, that has acquired cult status in celebrity circles. In 2019, the New York Times reported that only ""carefully vetted clients"" would be added to a waiting list -- after which they would need to wait up to eight years to purchase one. Then, last year, the company offered an unexpected response to the demand: it discontinued the 5711. In the aforementioned Times article, company president Thierry Stern, whose family has run the watchmakers since 1932, suggested that Patek Philippe did not want to be seen as a one-model brand. ""We make about 140 different models at Patek Philippe, and the basic Ref. 5711 in steel is just one of them,"" he was quoted as saying. ""We have many other models that are more complicated and arguably more beautiful."" Colored gemstones and 'imperfect' diamonds: Non-traditional engagement rings are here to stayThe 5711 nonetheless made a brief reappearance in late 2021, with the release of a limited-edition olive-green version and a Tiffany & Co. collaboration in the US jeweler's iconic blue. But -- for now at least -- the model appears to have been scrubbed from the brand's website, where the coveted 5711 is conspicuous by its absence among over 25 other types of Nautilus. Aura of exclusivityWaiting lists and soaring resale prices clearly bolster the brand's aura of exclusivity. But the scarcity may be a genuine matter of supply and demand. While Rolex is thought to produce in the region of a million timepieces a year, Patek Philippe's annual output may be as little as 50,000, Chan said.

Credit: Brian Dowling/WireImage/Getty Images""Everyone thinks (waiting lists are) a marketing strategy, but because the demand has increased in such short time, they really cannot meet it. Over the past two years, my watch circles are seeing 10 times the normal requests for the Nautilus or the Aquanaut,"" she said, referring to another popular range launched in 1997.  ""That's just my little circle, so can you imagine, all around the world, how many people are trying to get one or two or three for themselves?""If the watchmaker were to ramp up production, it might come at the cost of quality, which could itself threaten the brand, added Hodinkee's Marino.""What any elite watchmaker will tell you is that they produce as many as they can to maintain the level of quality that their customers expect,"" he said. ""Now, could Patek produce a ton more watches and put their name on it? They could. But then it wouldn't be Patek anymore. The limited nature and the craftsmanship is what you're paying for to begin with."""
world,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ai-weiwei-winter-olympics-2022-christiane-amanpour/index.html,Ai Weiwei helped design Beijing's Olympic stadium. But he regrets how it's being used today,,"Written by Jacqui PalumboChristiane Amanpour, CNNContributors Henry Hullah, CNNChristiane Amanpour's interview with Ai Weiwei airs Friday 1pm ET.  See more here.As the Beijing Winter Olympics gets underway, artist Ai Weiwei is once again criticizing China's ruling Communist Party -- and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he said is ""ignoring"" the safety of the country's athletes by prioritizing business and ""standing next to the authoritarians.""The world-renowned Chinese dissident and rights activist made the comments to CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview from Portugal, where he has been living in self-exile since 2021. Fearing for his safety were he to return to China, where he was once detained for 81 days for ""inciting the subversion of state power,"" Ai has resided around Europe for almost seven years.Years prior to his departure from his home country, Ai famously consulted on the design of the venue hosting Friday night's opening ceremony: The Beijing National Stadium, or ""Bird's Nest.""The open-roofed structure, wrapped in interwoven steel structs, functioned as one of the main venues for the Summer Olympics in 2008. A collaboration with Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, the stadium took five years to build and was designed to represent a new, modern China. Ai Weiwei: International Olympic Committee 'standing next to the authoritarians' How to watch the Winter Olympics in the US and around the worldBut the artist distanced himself from the project and criticized China's hosting of the Olympics ahead of the opening ceremony, believing it to be a propaganda tool at odds with what he felt were the oppressive realities of life in the country.""Unfortunately, as an architect, you cannot control how the building is being used,"" Ai told Amanpour in the interview, which airs Friday. ""For me it's a big disappointment, not only in how it's being used but also in the directions China (has taken) in past decades.""In his recently published book ""1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows,"" Ai wrote about the stadium's design, which was inspired by the art of Chinese ceramics. It ""aimed to convey the message that freedom was possible,"" he wrote, and ""encapsulated something essential about democracy, transparency and equity.""""We have to defend everybody who has been mistreated, and only by doing that, can we build a better future.""Ai WeiweiWhen asked if he really believed, back then, that China would become democratic, free and transparent, Ai responded, ""Well, by that time, of course I believed so. But at this moment, I doubt (it),"" adding that that the country has, in many ways, gone ""backwards.""In the lead up to this year's Winter games, which Ai has also been openly critical of, China has been subjected to increased international scrutiny, from its alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang to its stringent Covid-19 policies to the global concern for the well-being of Chinese tennis player and three-time Olympian, Peng Shuai. Peng disappeared from public view for over two weeks after she accused a former top Communist Party official of sexual assault. Beijing denies allegations of human rights abuses and has dismissed fears for Peng's safety as ""malicious speculation."" The IOC, meanwhile, did not respond directly to Ai's accusations, but said in a statement to CNN that it ""recognizes and upholds human rights,"" which are ""enshrined"" in both the Olympic Charter and the organization's code of ethics. ""Given the diverse participation in the Olympic Games,"" read the statement, ""the IOC must remain neutral on global political issues.""But Ai argued that the IOC has ""never"" been neutral. ""They're always standing next to the authoritarians or business,"" he told Amanpour. ""Since the 2008 Olympics, they have been working with the government's propaganda, and this time they are (doing so) even more. They are ignoring the top (Chinese) athletes' safety and well-being.""While the dissident artist has not called for athletes to boycott the games, he appealed to their ""sense of justice and fairness,"" adding: ""The Games is about fairness, the competition is about fairness. And so, athletes representing human spirit (should) of course defend those very important issues, such as human rights and freedom of speech.The Beijing National Stadium also known as the ""Bird's Nest.""  Credit: Goh Chai Hin/AFP/Getty ImagesA 'citizen of nowhere'Ai said he wrote ""1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows,"" his first memoir, to show young people what he called the ""absurd"" reality of living in China.""I have to write (for) my son's generation to understand what really happened to his father and his grandfather,"" he told Amanpour. Ai's father, a poet who was also accused of subverting state power, spent time in jail and was sent to a labor camp in Xinjiang when Ai was a child. Ai later joined him in the far northwestern region where, today, China has been accused of genocide by the United States against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. What we know -- and don't -- about director Zhang Yimou's Winter Olympics opening ceremonyAi said he ultimately left China in 2015 because he lacked a ""sense of safety"" as an artist. His conceptual works, many of which were considered controversial in China, often contend with the country's past and present using found objects. He has created sculptures from the remains of demolished Ming and Qing dynasty houses, as well as from steel rods salvaged from schools that collapsed during the deadly 2008 Sichuan earthquake. One of his most famous works, a photo triptych from 1995, shows him smashing a Han dynasty urn.""China is totally under the control of one party, and the party can do anything,"" he said of his reasons for living in self-exile. ""It can make you disappear. It can make you (go on) trial without lawyers. And also, they can put you (for) a long time behind bars. Nobody can (argue with authorities) -- that's the reality. So, if I want to have a sense of safety, a normal life, I have to escape.""The best books of 2021, according to global tastemakersAi has been critical of other countries too, particularly when it comes to the West's treatment of refugees.""I'm a citizen of the world, if I can call it that. Actually, I'm a citizen of nowhere,"" he told Amanpour. ""So, wherever I see injustice, I always think that's connected. Whatever happens in Afghanistan, in Syria, is connected to China (and) also connected to the United States. We have to understand humanity as one, human rights as one. We have to defend everybody who has been mistreated, and only by doing that, can we build a better future."""
world,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/durer-drawing-yard-sale-scli-intl/index.html,"Dürer drawing bought for $30 at yard sale worth more than $10 million, experts say",,"Written by Sara SparyHannah Ryan, CNNA 16th century drawing by one of the key figures of the German Renaissance has been valued in excess of $10 million after it was initially purchased at a yard sale for just $30 in 2017.According to Agnews Gallery -- the London auction house in possession of the artwork -- Albrecht Dürer, who died in 1528, is regarded as both the greatest German artist of his time and as one of the most important artists and intellectuals of the European Renaissance. The drawing that has been rediscovered is titled ""The Virgin and Child."" As Dürer's career and legacy has been studied in depth since his death, it is extremely rare to find unknown works of his and Agnews said in a press release that this drawing has been ""the subject of significant interest since its rediscovery.""Boston-based art collector Clifford Schorer, who is a consultant to the gallery, told CNN Thursday that he came across the rare artwork, thought to have been completed in 1503, by chance on the way to a party in Massachusetts in 2019.College professor recognizes 17th century masterpiece hanging in a nearby church He had forgotten to bring a gift to the party and so took a detour to a bookstore, which sold collectable volumes, en route. The bookseller told him his friend had a Dürer drawing and asked if he would take a look at it. Schorer agreed, but held out little hope, given that the last time an unknown drawing of ""caliber"" by the artist was discovered was more than 100 years ago, he said.Dürer had a significant body of work. ""Young Hare,"" completed in 1502 and pictured here, is widely regarded to be one of the artist's most celebrated works because it is indicative of his observational style. Credit: Giorgio Morara/Alamy Stock PhotoThe artwork had been purchased at a yard sale at the home of an architect who had been gifted the piece from his art dealer father, Schorer said.""Generally speaking it's an inverse relationship between how dramatic the claim is and how much of a let down it is. ""[For example] if someone tells me they have a Leonardo [da Vinci], I'm usually pretty confident I'm going to see some images that are unimpressive,"" Schorer said.But when he arrived to examine the artwork weeks later, he was taken aback by its quality.Schorer said he told the owner, who wishes to remain anonymous: ""I think it's either the greatest forgery I've ever seen or a masterpiece."" An 'extremely exciting' discovery""It was like [experiencing] a kind of electricity. When you're in my world you spend your life looking for unknown things that lead to fascinating research avenues... and I could see I was at the beginning of something extremely exciting,"" Schorer said.Schorer described how he then began a three-year journey to verify the artwork, which involved taking 17 international flights around the world to consult experts.This included a roundtable at the British Museum in London in December last year, where the drawing was examined by scholars in the field alongside other works on paper by Dürer, according to Schorer and Agnews.'Extremely rare' 17th-century painting of Black woman with White companion placed under export bar from UKThe artwork has undergone technical age analysis and bears the hallmark of the artist, Schorer said. He believes it is worth ""eight figures"" and in excess of $10 million.""It's probably fair to say he's one of the greatest graphic designers that ever lived -- a pioneer in engraving and drawing. He was a maestro in black and white, and his famous prints ... inspired artists all over the world.""""In terms of relative value, I think you have to compare it to other old master drawings,"" Schorer said, such as the Dutch artist Lucas van Leyden, whose drawing sold for $15.6 million in 2018."

Others took to Twitter to express their utter disbelief at the likeness: ""Lily James EMBODYING Pamela Anderson. The hair and makeup department definitely is getting paid bc woah now!""Out today, the show -- which also stars Sebastian Stan as Anderson's ex-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee -- chronicles the sex-tape scandal of the late 1990s that turned the then-couple's lives upside-down. At the time of that infamous invasion of privacy, Anderson's particular brand of beauty was already unmistakable.Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee backstage at the American Music Awards in 1997.

""This is a transformation beyond transformation,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""Can you believe this is Lily James?""The meticulous detail in Lily James' transformation has shocked on-lookers. Credit: Erin Simkin/HULUStars in silhouette The metamorphosis was the work of a team led by award-winning visuals experts, including the head of makeup David Williams, hair department head Barry Lee Moe and special makeup effects designer, Jason Collins. ""When those first images hit the internet, it was validation for something that we were already feeling was happening,"" Williams said in a video interview. ""Certain projects have kinetic energy about them. That's undeniable. And this is one of those shows.""Research was the foundation of their efforts. The team began by trawling through the extensive collection of paparazzi photos taken of Anderson over the years to nail down Andersons' ""silhouette.""""The silhouette is everything,"" Collins said during the same video call, for which Moe was also present. ""You don't want to do a caricature. That's the worst thing that you could possibly do. You want to try to find a natural median between the two actresses."" Hair department head Barry Lee Moe was even strict on replicating Anderson's hair texture when wet. Credit: Erica Parise/HULUIt took around four hours each day to get James into character, using a combination of 15 pairs of lace eyebrows, four wigs, two rows of hand-sculpted dentures, a breast plate and a prosthetic forehead -- and that's before Williams could even think about recreating Anderson's makeup.""Finding the essence of Pam was such a trial and error experience for us,"" Moe said. ""We did a lot of tests in the beginning, scaling (James' hair and makeup) down as the day went on to see how little we could get away with. (But) when we removed all of the appliances on the face and just had Lily in a wig and paint, it was Lily in a wig and paint.""Why this year's Oscars could be a breakthrough for female cinematographersWhile many know Anderson for her voluptuous physique, it was the prosthetic forehead that turned out to be the bedrock of James' transformation. ""The forehead was really where we planted our flag,"" Collins said. It was the missing piece of the puzzle: Anderson had more ""real estate"" up there than James, Williams added, meaning everything from Moe's painstakingly crafted wigs to the wafer-thin eyebrows Williams created sat more convincingly with that addition.The prosthetic forehead became the bedrock of the character makeup. Credit: Erin Simkin/HULUMoe, Collins and Williams believed that production indulging them in all the aesthetic bells and whistles not only made their job easier (""The devil is in the details, and we were three little devils,"" Williams said, chuckling.), it had a palpable impact on the actors, too. James kept her custom-made dentures in all day, according to Collins, which improved her grasp of Anderson's diction. Similarly, a Brazilian straightening treatment on Stan's real hair allowed him to ""live and breathe"" Tommy Lee, Moe said. ""From the time he woke up in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he wanted to carry that hair with him,"" Moe added.Devil in the detailsFor the rest of Stan's transformation into the Mötley Crüe drummer, research was equally granular. No detail was overlooked, unless the team were contractually obliged to overlook it. ""We can't for legal purposes use (Lee's) exact tattoos, so we do slight alterations to them,"" Williams explained. To recreate Lee's extensive body art, the team created a chronological timeline of every tattoo he had ever gotten. ""But some of those tattoos are incomplete, they're being worked on. Like the ""Mayhem"" on his chest, in the wedding photos, only half of it's there,"" Collins said. ""So in the end, you have to get together with everybody and decide what our tattoos are going to be, and what are we going to stick with for the point of storytelling.""Stan was given a 3D body scan to accurately figure out the scale of Lee's tattoos. Credit: Erica Parise/HULUOnce the designs were selected, Stan was taken in for a 3D body scan to figure out how they would fit Lee's 6'2"" tattoo proportions on Stan's 5'11"" frame. Overall, it took three hours each morning to transfer around 35 individual temporary tattoos onto the actor's body.The final, and somewhat surprising, building block was a hollowed-out prosthetic penis animated by two puppeteers. Early on in the series, Lee and his appendage have an extended conversation, arguing over whether he and Anderson should abstain (days) until marriage.The surreal interaction was actually lifted from Lee's 2005 memoir ""Tommyland,"" writer Robert Siegel told Variety, in which Lee recounts confessing his feelings for Anderson out loud, to his penis.""When David and I first read the script, I believe I called Dave and I said, 'You think they're gonna keep this thing?'"" Collins recalled. FDA adds boxed warning to breast implants ""My words were, 'This could be really great. Or this could be a dumpster fire,'"" Williams added.The writers needed to tread carefully, considering neither Lee nor Anderson gave Hulu their permission to produce the biopic. But by the time they had shot the scene, the team was grateful for the fantasy element offered by the talking penis. ""I like the choice of our creators to go in that direction,"" Collins said. ""As opposed to some salacious version of focusing on what was actually on the (leaked sex) tape. This was a much smarter way to understand this (sexual) element exists.""The prosthetic penis was hollowed out and came with a saddle to fix onto Stan's pevis. Credit: Erin Simkin/HULUWhile Lee is reportedly ""cool"" with the adaptation, Anderson has yet to comment on the series. ""I hope that if she does choose to watch or sees pieces of it, she will see the care that was taken by Lily to be the steward of her story,"" Williams said.""If we could say anything to Pam,"" Moe added, ""it'd be that, we love you, Pam, and we thank you. She changed the landscape in so many ways, from beauty trends to all the work that she does with her animal rights activism. And I think (being able) to honor a woman like Pam was such a blessing. To be a part of telling that story.""Add to queue: Best biopic transformationsWatch: ""Being the Ricardos"" (2021)Nicole Kidman was plastered in a combination of prosthetics, false eyebrows and 1950s-inspired makeup to recreate American actress Lucille Ball in the biopic released on Amazon Prime last December.Watch: ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018)Rami Malek was given a prosthetic nose and hand-crafted teeth to convincingly mimic the appearance of Queen front man Freddie Mercury for the 2018 movie. Prosthetic designer Jan Sewell told Variety there were several false mustaches needed for Malek's version of Mercury, and that she would  ""clean and tone"" them every night.Watch: ""I, Tonya"" (2017) Margot Robbie was slathered in cobalt eyeshadow and intense rouge to help her embody 1980s figure skater Tonya Harding. Makeup department head Deborah La Mia Denaver even used a method called ""reverse contouring,"" which uses highlight instead of shadow, to make Robbie's face appear wider and less defined.Update: An earlier version of this story introduced Jason Collins as a prosthetic coordinator.

world,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/frederic-chaubin-stone-age-castles/index.html,Dramatic photos cast Europe's ancient castles in a new light,,"Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNNFor centuries, medieval castles -- hulking, isolated triumphs of masonry -- have held a special place in the Western imagination, evoking at once a sense of history, fantasy, war and romance. They are the perennial backdrops for period dramas and children's books, travel brochures and fashion spreads. But in his latest book, ""Stone Age: Ancient Castles of Europe,"" writer and photographer Frédéric Chaubin set out to disrupt the familiar stereotypes, using prose and photography to link the medieval with the Modernist. ""Instead of just considering them as historical remains, I was much more interested in building a link between this very primitive architecture and the basics and principles of Modernism, which were more or less set up at the beginning of the 20th century through theoretical works by Adolf Loos or Le Corbusier,"" he explained in a phone interview, referring to the influential theorists and architects who lobbied against ornamentation and venerated clean shapes.""(The principle) that form follows function is perfectly expressed in this very, very primitive architecture."" The Romanesque castle of Almourol in Portugal belonged to the order of the Templars, who were very active in bringing Christianity to the Iberian Peninsula.  Credit: Frédéric Chaubin/Courtesy of TASCHENWhen castles first emerged in the 10th century as an alternative to wooden structures, they were envisaged as fortified dwellings for the ruling class. Protection trumped decoration: Towers were built high to safeguard inhabitants from outside threats, moats were defenses rather than water features and designs were adapted to fit the changing rules of war or the domestic needs of castle residents. Germany's ex-royals want their riches back, but past ties to Hitler stand in the way ""Stone Age"" is Chaubin's second book, following 2011's ""CCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed,"" a stylish tome that presented seven years' worth of photography and research into the architecture of the Soviet Union. For his new book, however, he armed himself with a traditional large-format view camera and travelled to the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, the Baltics and beyond, photographing more than 200 castles built between the 10th and 15th centuries. In Spain stands the Renaissance palace La Calahorra, dating back to the 16th century. Credit: Frédéric Chaubin/Courtesy of TASCHENWhen making his final selection, Chaubin prioritized the impressiveness of a castle's location and its architectural simplicity -- in keeping with his overarching theme -- rather than its historical significance. ""It's about the (context) much more than about the buildings themselves,"" he said. ""The most interesting ones are the ones that are really isolated; you have the feeling that you discovered them."" An evolving roleTypically, Chaubin shot the castles upon approach, capturing their majesty as they first emerged into view -- the Grimburg Castle in Germany, for instance, appears as a darkened silhouette against frost-covered terrain, while a placid lake separates the photographer from Scotland's Castle Stalker. Chaubin hoped to convey ""the specific moments when you first see the building."" ""I quite often feature the castle at a distance because usually you discover buildings at a distance,"" he explained. ""I'm inviting people to travel with me."" A view of the fortified Castle Stalker in Scotland, which dates back to the 15th century. Credit: Frédéric Chaubin/Courtesy of TASCHENThe photographer was particularly taken with the ruined sandstone Château de Quéribus in the south of France, or Manqueospese, in Avila, Spain, which was constructed from local granite -- castles that convey a natural connection to their surroundings and ""seem to be getting out of the ground,"" as Chaubin put it. Hong Kong Disneyland's new castle is an architectural vision of diversityThe book is divided into thematic chapters addressing the origins and evolution of castles, the geopolitical context of their development and, later, their abandonment. While the structures Chaubin spotlights share similarities in terms of material and basic forms, he found organizing them chronologically a challenge. Castle Manqueospese in Spain, which appears to melt into the lunar granite landscape.  Credit: Frédéric Chaubin/Courtesy of TASCHEN""It's extremely difficult to connect them with a specific period because, with the European medieval castles I was photographing, (the construction started) around the 10th century but then they went through transformations for centuries and centuries,"" he said. The 13th-century castles he photographed in Wales, for example, were modified over time in keeping with the evolution of weaponry and war strategies; Moorish castles on the Iberian Peninsula were radically redesigned by the Catholics who later took them over. As the Renaissance approached, and the near-constant threat of invasion disappeared, decorative elements and large windows were often introduced to facilitate a castle's transition from fortress to palace. Through the mist rises German castle Grimburg, dating back to the 12th century. Credit: Frédéric Chaubin/Courtesy of TASCHEN""From the 15th century onwards, they had no reason to be (a defensive structure), so the castles were turned into mansions or palaces, or left to decay,"" Chaubin explained. Dividing the castles by location seemed equally futile, given that Europe's borders were in constant flux during the centuries covered in the book. The abundance of invasions (which explains the trail of Crusades-era Norman castles between modern-day England and the Middle East) and intermarriage between monarchies also meant that architectural styles were widely exported and adapted to incorporate local vernaculars. 'Irreplaceable' artifacts worth more than $1.4 million stolen from English castle But, ultimately, this lack of visual coherence was a source of fascination rather than frustration for Chaubin. ""I was much more impressed by the array of differences (than the similarities),"" he said. ""The very large typology of those castles made the subject more difficult to deal with, but at the same time, more interesting.""""Stone Age: Ancient Castles of Europe,"" published by Taschen, is available now.

A burgeoning international rail network for 2022.The continent's night trains have gone from being on the verge of extinction to a Europe-wide resurgence, spearheaded by Austrian carrier ÖBB, with new, private companies springing up to offer more options.Meanwhile as more day trains are laid on across the continent, prices are falling. Italy's two high-speed networks are knocking out ever more fancy carriages to attract customers, while low-cost, high-speed trains have been rolled out in France and Spain.So where to ride the rails in 2022? Here are the new routes that have opened up Europe over the past few months -- and ones to look forward to for the rest of the year.NOW IN SERVICEVienna to ParisOBB's new Vienna-Paris sleeper follows the original Orient Express route.Harald Eisenberger/OBBOBB's Nightjet train from Vienna to Paris launched in December 2021 and runs three times a week in both directions. It's one of several trains connecting major European cities -- it runs via Salzburg, Munich and Strasbourg -- and follows the route of the original Orient Express (for a much lower price). The 14-hour journey departs from Vienna at 7.40 p.m. and arrives in Paris at 9.42 a.m., just in time for a croissant and a café au lait; if you're taking it the other way, it runs 10 minutes later. Fares start at $101 in a private cabin.Related contentHow Italy's high-speed trains helped kill AlitaliaAmsterdam to ZurichTake the new sleeper from Amsterdam to wake up pulling into Zurich station.Adobe StockAnother Nightjet sleeper train, this December 2021-launched route connects Amsterdam and Zurich. It calls in at German stations on the way, including Cologne, Bonn and Frankfurt Airport, before crossing into Switzerland at Basel. The full journey takes just under 12 hours, arriving at Zurich shortly after 8 a.m., and Amsterdam after 9 a.m. for those traveling the other way.Genoa to NaplesItalo is bringing high-speed rail to Genoa.ItaloIt may be Italy's sixth largest city, but Genoa is poorly connected with the rest of the country; to reach the capital, your options are either to take a regular train down the west coast, or to go northeast to Milan and change to a high-speed train down south.  At least, that's how it was until Italo -- Italy's rival high-speed network to state-owned Trenitalia -- started a route from Genoa all the way down to Naples.

The whole journey takes six hours and 45 minutes, shaving 80 minutes off the previous direct route.Brussels to Prague The new Brussels to Prague sleeper is a Dutch-Belgian cooperative.zgphotography/Adobe StockThis is one big European odyssey, launching summer 2022. European Sleeper's night train will wind its way across the continent in the dark, leaving Brussels at dinner time and passing through major cities including Amsterdam, Hannover and Berlin, before arriving at Prague in time for a late breakfast, around 10.30 a.m.. It'll run three times a week, with tickets going on sale in spring. The company is a Dutch-Belgian cooperative running in partnership with Czech operator RegioJet, and it says it'll launch a Brussels-Warsaw route in 2023.

While this isn't a new route -- French TGVs already connect the two cities -- it's a much more glamorous way to do it, particularly if you book the Frecciarossa's Executive class, whose grand armchairs rather resemble those on a private jet. The route is a great one -- via Turin, Chambery and Lyon -- and it knocks 20 minutes off the TGV time, too.

The new Lumo service, which launched in October 2021, aims to provide an alternative to low-cost airlines, which normally cash in on the route, since UK trains are notoriously expensive. Having started running three services a day, they'll upgrade to five in April. However, check your fare carefully -- although prices start at $20 each way, the cheapest we could see on one day we checked, two months in advance, was $58. Lumo says that 60% of tickets are sold at $41 or less.Cuneo to NiceThe Cuneo-Nice line is known as the 'railway of marvels,' pitching between Italy and France before emerging on the Med at Nice.Adobe StockThe ride from Cuneo, in the mountains of Piedmont, down to Nice, on the Cote d'Azur, is so beautiful that in 2021, members of non-profit heritage organization, FAI (Fondo per l'Ambiente Italiano) declared it one of the most precious things in Italy. Descending 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) over 60 miles, it's a jaw-dropping ride through mountains, across high viaducts, and down to the Mediterranean Sea, crisscrossing between Italy and France all the while. No wonder it's known as the ""Ferrovia delle meraviglie"" -- railway of marvels.

It's not super high-speed yet -- the whole journey takes around three hours, though it should be reduced to two hours and 15 minutes within two years.

world,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/ghost-flights-pandemic-greenpeace-cmd/index.html,Why the sky is still full of empty 'ghost' flights,,"(CNN) — In the early days of the pandemic, when demand for air travel abruptly flatlined and international borders closed, ""ghost flights"" became a common phenomenon. These were empty or near-empty planes traversing the skyline as airline schedules kept to their contractual obligations to fly. The problem is that, nearly two years on, they're still haunting the skies above us. In fact, more than 100,000 ""ghost flights"" will sail over European skies this winter, according to recent analysis from Greenpeace. The climate damage, claims the environmental group, is ""equivalent to the yearly emissions of more than 1.4 million cars.""The Greenpeace figures are extrapolated from a December interview with Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr in which he warned that Lufthansa Group was facing the prospect of 18,000 superfluous flights over the six-month winter season to retain its slots under European rules. On the basis that Lufthansa's air traffic accounts for 17% of the European market, Greenpeace reckons the total number of Europe's ghost flights would generate 2.1 million tonnes of CO2. The analysis has triggered a torrent of outrage. Campaigner Greta Thunberg asserted that ""Brussels Airlines [part of the Lufthansa group] makes 3,000 unnecessary flights to maintain airport slots."" In the UK, a petition was launched, appealing to the government to ground unoccupied flights. Lufthansa, meanwhile, says it's doing its best to fill all its aircraft, but was struggling to balance Covid chaos with the need to hold onto its slots.""Unnecessary flights are not empty or 'ghost' flights,"" a spokesman for the airline told CNN. ""They are scheduled flights that are poorly booked due to the pandemic. Despite poor demand, Lufthansa Group Airlines must operate these flights to continue securing takeoff and landing rights at hubs and major EU airports.""Lufthansa says that the emergence of the Omicron variant is the reason its projections for the season ahead were so far short of the reality. The crisis ""led to significantly increased travel restrictions and cases of illness in the general population and among employees,"" says its spokesperson. ""This unexpectedly not only reduced the prior trend of recovery, but also triggered a significant slump in demand.""Last October, the aviation industry pledged at the International Air Transport Association (IATA) annual meeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Numerous players -- including hub-based carriers, low-cost airlines, regulators and environmental lobbyists -- are at loggerheads in a multi-way blame game over the absurd wastefulness of unnecessary flights. ""We're in a climate crisis, and the transport sector has the fastest-growing emissions in the EU -- pointless, polluting 'ghost flights' are just the tip of the iceberg,"" says Herwig Schuster, spokesperson for Greenpeace's ""European Mobility For All"" campaign. ""It would be irresponsible of the EU to not take the low-hanging fruit of ending ghost flights and banning short-haul flights where there's a reasonable train connection,"" he adds.So why on Earth are these Mary Celeste flights still ongoing -- and what are aviation's stakeholders doing to disentangle themselves from the red tape that has ensnared the airlines into this climate-damaging mess?Related contentHow close are we to guilt-free flying?Precious assetsThe reason airlines continue to operate these expensive flights is because the industry is engaged in a slots game more high stakes and lucrative than anything you'll find in Las Vegas.Even when passengers are staying away, airlines still need to protect their slots: their scheduled time on valuable routes.Slots are extremely precious assets for airlines. With more than 200 of the planet's busiest hubs operating at full capacity, demand for flights exceeds the availability of runways and space inside the terminals.To manage this, capacity at congested airports is segmented into slots. These are the facility to land, disembark passengers, refuel, take on a new cohort of passengers and then take off again -- all within a specified and regulated time frame.Carriers then plan their schedules based on slot availability at both ends of the route. To maximize revenue, the schedules have to align with demand -- early morning slots for business travelers traveling short-haul, same-day-return trips are highly prized.But synchronizing the timing of both ends of the journey when the most desirable airports are full up is no easy feat.""If you take off from one place you need to know you can land at a certain time at another,"" says Paul Steele of the IATA. ""If you tinker with slot allocation at one end of the process, it creates chaos at the other end, and therefore we need a harmonized system.""That's where the Worldwide Airport Slot Guidelines (WASG) come in. These are the foundation upon which the global slot allocation process works. The Guidelines (jointly published by IATA, Airports Council International and the Worldwide Airport Coordinators Group) aspire to deliver ""transparency, flexibility, certainty, consistency and sustainability ... for the benefit of airlines, airports and consumers.""Lufthansa's boss says the group will have to run 18,000 unnnecessary flights over the winter season in order to hold onto its airport slots. Silas Stein/AFP/Getty ImagesMind-boggling systemBut with airlines operating hundreds of city-pair routes -- some synchronized with connecting flights -- this is a mind-boggling system to administer, and the allocation must be done twice a year for the summer and winter season schedules.To re-plan all of this every six months would be too complicated, so there's a rule that states that if an airline successfully uses its slot at least 80% of the time, it is allowed to retain the slot the following season, a system known as ""grandfather rights.""There's therefore very little flexibility in the network for introducing new routes, especially at congested airports. And that's why slots are gold dust.In the UK, Heathrow Airport holds the most valuable slots. Limited capacity there has propelled the price of slots skywards, with an early morning slot pair worth around $19 million, falling to $13 million at midday and $6 million in the evening, according to a UK House of Commons briefing paper.Record-breaking deals where airlines have traded these slots include the case of Oman Air, which was reported to have paid $75 million for a pair of takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow in early 2016. In March 2017, SAS Scandinavian Airlines sold two slot pairs at Heathrow to American Airlines for $75 million, according to the same paper. Usually, however, airlines keep these contractual details under wraps.Slots can also be traded in other ways, such as swaps between carriers, similar to the way that football teams have players out on loan.Because of the ""grandfather rights"" system, airlines reducing their use of the slots risk losing them. Cutting capacity is threatening the airlines' hold on their slots, which is why planes might still be operated even when hardly anyone is flying in them.Related contentThe rapid rise of 'red tourism' in China Loosening the red tapeTwo years ago, when the initial impact of Covid decimated the airline networks, the 80% rule was relaxed.In the United States, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) waived the slot usage, just as it had previously suspended the regulation in 2002, 2003 and 2009 -- following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States; the outbreak of SARS; and the global financial crisis, respectively.And in Europe, for the current Winter 2021-2022 period, the ""use it or lose it"" threshold was lowered to 50%. But airlines are facing increased uncertainty and want greater latitude for retaining their slots. Air France-KLM Group, for example, issued a statement, seeking ""the current [Covid] situation to be better taken into account in the application of European regulations so that airlines can continue to adjust their offer to actual demand levels."" In particular, the Group seeks increased flexibility ""in the application of the force majeure rules allowing for derogations from the 50% slot utilization rule.""In response, and perhaps in recognition that the Omicron variant is now playing havoc with everybody's travel plans, the European Commission issued an extension to the slot relief rules effective until October 29, 2022. However the Commission is raising its threshold to 64% in April.""The progress in vaccination campaigns and the EU Digital Covid-19 Certificate have helped to restore traveler confidence and air connectivity in the EU, putting the industry in a stronger position to deal with short-term shocks,"" explains Adina Vălean, the EU's commissioner for transport. ""Even if we are not there yet, we can take a step further towards the return to normal airport slot management next summer."" Vălean says the EU is monitoring the situation, acknowledging the lingering impact of Omicron on airline bookings. ""The Commission has demonstrated throughout the Covid-19 crisis its willingness and ability to act swiftly where needed, and this will remain the case in the coming months,"" she adds. Heathrow is the UK's busiest airport. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images Europe/Getty ImagesPayback time?From the perspective of one of Europe's largest low-cost carriers, solving the problem of ghost flights may be straightforward.Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary says that, ""If Lufthansa really needs to operate these flights (solely to prevent the release of these slots to competitor airlines), then they should be required to sell these seats to the public at low fares."" O'Leary's contention is that Lufthansa and its subsidiary airlines (Brussels Airlines, Swiss and Austrian) have benefited from billions of State Aid. Consequently, ""instead of operating empty flights just so they can block slots, Lufthansa should release the seats on these flights for sale at low fares to reward the German and European taxpayers who have subsidized it with €billions during the Covid crisis,"" he says.However, Lufthansa's spokesperson argues that it's a different situation for larger airlines. ""Network companies like Lufthansa Group are more dependent on slots for feeder flights that connect passengers to long-haul routes at group hubs than low-cost airlines that tend to fly to smaller airports where there usually is no shortage of slots,"" he says. The only exception to the use-it-or-lose-it rule is the force majeure clause. However, this is not interpreted uniformly throughout Europe. Many countries grant no exceptions or only a few.Instigating exceptions is also very bureaucratic and time-consuming. Each exception must be granted individually: for the starting point and the destination -- therefore two approvals are always required. Since approvals are usually granted on short notice before a flight, there is no longer enough time for passengers to be rebooked.Lufthansa says it wants all EU member states to be granted exceptions to takeoff and landing rules so that the issue can be addressed flexibly, minimizing bureaucracy for the current winter schedule. ""The EU Commission should advocate uniform regulations so unnecessary flights are avoided and airlines are able to better plan,"" says its spokesperson.Protect and competeMeanwhile, ACI Europe, the professional association of airport operators which represents over 500 airports in 55 countries, has expressed dismay at the escalating industry and political rhetoric around ghost flights. It's also casting doubt on the reasoning of the major hub carriers that ghost flights are unavoidable.""A few airlines are claiming they are forced to run high volumes of empty flights in order to retain airport slot usage rights. There is absolutely no reason why this should be the reality,"" says ACI Europe director general, Olivier Jankovec. Slot usage rules, he says, need to achieve two things in the current circumstances: ""to protect airlines from the worst of unpredictabilities which are out of all our hands, and crucially, to also ensure that airport capacity is still used in a pro-competitive way.""Jankovec adds that reconciling commercial viability alongside the need to retain essential connectivity and protect against anti-competitive consequences is a delicate task: ""We believe that the European Commission has got this right. Talk of ghost flights, and of their environmental impacts, seems to hint at a doomsday scenario which has no place in reality. Let's stick to the vital task of recovering and rebuilding together"". And going one step further, on February 2, IATA released a statement welcoming updated guidance from the European Airport Coordinators Association, intended to provide a more harmonized policies on slot-use thresholds. Willie Walsh, IATA's director general, said such a move was crucial for ""sustaining critical European air connectivity"" and for ""leveling the playing field with jurisdictions that have recognized the need for full flexibility."" That promise of flexibility will be pivotal to the minimization of empty flights. But ultimately, their complete eradication will only be achieved when the public's propensity for air travel, facilitated by the eventual and complete conquest over the Covid virus, enables airlines to fill their planes with fare-paying passengers -- instead of ghosts.Top image: A plane flies over the Yas Viceroy Abu Dhabi Hotel in Abu Dhabi in November 2015.

world,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-valentines-day-himalayas/index.html,They met on Valentine's Day while hiking in the Himalayas,,"(CNN) — It was Valentine's Day 1996 when Lee Green walked into a mountain lodge in Nepal, surrounded by the snowcapped Himalayas, and encountered Mandy Halse for the first time.Green and Halse were thousands of miles from their respective homes in England and New Zealand. Both were backpackers in their twenties determined to see as much of the world as they could. They'd found themselves in Nepal by a series of coincidences. When Green entered the Nepalese teahouse, the stage was set for a memorable meet-cute.Except on February 14, there were no sparks between the two travelers.Two weeks later it was a different story, one that's still ongoing 26 years later.A meeting in GhorepaniHere's Mandy Halse in Nepal on the morning of  February 14, 1996.Kirsty BloomFor Halse, Nepal was a spontaneous layover en route from Auckland to the UK, where she was set to visit an old friend. She'd been exploring Thailand and Malaysia, and a travel agent had recommended breaking up the journey with a stint in Nepal. After learning of Nepal's trekking routes, she met a British woman, Kirsty, while in line for a permit to hike the Annapurna Circuit. The two decided to join forces to tackle the trail, which winds through Nepal's central mountains, taking in picturesque villages and incredible views along the way.Halse, who'd had no idea what to expect, was awestruck by the spectacular landscape, particularly when she and fellow hikers arrived in the village of Ghorepani, where they set up camp in a ""teahouse"" mountain lodge.""It was the most beautiful setting,"" Halse tells CNN Travel today.She was sitting in the lodge's common area with her new friend Kirsty and other backpackers when Lee Green walked in.Green, a mailman from the English town of Coventry, was traveling Nepal on a career break with colleague and good friend Murray. The two men had originally intended to use their sabbatical to embark on a cycle ride from the UK to India, but had abandoned the plan after just 200 miles, realizing navigating northern Europe in winter on bike was going to take too long.Instead, they'd ended up flying to India, trekking through the northern part of the country, before making their way to Nepal.The two friends arrived at the city of Pokhara, and set off on the Annapurna trek. Like Halse, they'd befriended other travelers en route.Green (second from left) and Halse (third from right) embarked on Nepal's Annapurna circuit with a group of other backpackers they'd met along the way. Kirsty Bloom""There's one path that links village to village to village, so most people that go trekking tend to overlap each other, meet up with each other at the tea houses, along the path,"" Green tells CNN Travel today.When Green's group entered the teahouse, they were warmly greeted by Halse and the other travelers. The backpackers ended up chatting through the night, playing cards by candlelight.""It was really nice, it was really chilled,"" says Halse. ""The teahouse was gorgeous.""The travelers spent a couple of days there, before continuing as a group onto the next leg of the trek.Halse and Green were friendly to one another on their first few days hiking, but they didn't have much opportunity to chat one on one.""We didn't talk much in the beginning as we were both very quiet, and we walked in different parts of the group: me in the middle with Murray, and Lee at the back with Kirsty,"" says Halse.Related contentTwo strangers meet on an airplane. Four years later they fall in loveA growing connectionThe backpackers were trekking through spectacular landscapes. Here's the group near Muktinath Valley in February 1996.Kirsty BloomWhen the travelers reached the Annapurna circuit's 5,400-meter-high Thorung La mountain pass, they found their way blocked by heavy snow, forcing them to turn back.Some of the group decided to give up at that point, making their way back, via plane, to the trail's gateway town of Pokhara. Halse and Green, along with their friends Murray and Kirsty, decided to make the full return trek by foot, just the four of them.So began another two weeks of walking -- and it was in this period that Halse and Green started to grow closer.""We'd become quite good friends, and as we're walking along I started feeling the vibe, the tingles,"" says Halse.When the group arrived in Tatopani, just up the trail from their original meeting place in Ghorepani, the town's balmier climate and beautiful hot springs were a welcome change to the snows they'd just emerged from.""There's oranges and lemons growing everywhere, citrus fruits growing, it's like a little Garden of Eden. It's a great place to relax and chill after the hard trekking,"" says Green.Halse and Green grew closer as the trek continued.Kirsty BloomLounging at the hot springs over the next few days, Green and Halse grew closer still. They recall braiding one another's long hair and talking about previous adventures, their lives back home and travel goals.""We soon realized we were very similar,"" says Halse. ""We both wanted to travel, we were prepared to work hard and save money, and to achieve our travel goals, which is what we both wanted to do,"" adds Green. ""We realized it would be quite nice to do it together.""They shared their first kiss on February 29, 1996, a leap year. From that day onwards, they were inseparable. But while they were swept up in their new romance, the two remained keenly aware that travel flings don't always last, so Green and Halse focused on enjoying the moment. They decided, along with Kirsty and Murray, to extend their time in Nepal and embark on a trek to Everest.The only issue was Halse had somehow lost her passport. Before continuing any further, she had to head to Kathmandu to get new papers.So the pair said goodbye to one another, hoping it would just be a short separation, as Green and Murray went on ahead.A couple of days in, it looked like Halse's passport would be arriving sooner rather than later. With no internet or cellphones to convey the news, Halse scribbled a hand-written note updating Green, letting him know she'd be hot on his heels before long. Note in hand, Halse hopped onto the bus that was heading to the Everest trail, and asked if anyone heading that way would look out for the two men and pass on the message. She included a description of Green and Murray on the back of the note. Here's one of the notes Halse passed along the trail for Green.Lee & Mandy/Frugal TravellersShe did the same thing the following day, and the day after that -- and then before long, Halse had her new passport and she and Kirsty were en route to Namche Bazaar, the gateway to Everest, hoping to catch up with the two mailmen.The notes successfully made their way up the trail to Green and Murray.""As we got closer and closer to Namche Bazaar, all of a sudden people started walking up to us on the trail with these notes, and they were like, ""Oh we've got a note for you guys,"" -- you know, in the middle of the mountains in Nepal,"" recalls Green. ""We open the note and it's from Mandy.""The two men couldn't believe it.""More and more people started giving us these notes,"" says Green. ""So we wrote some notes back.""They passed these replies to trekkers walking the opposite way, describing Halse and Kirsty, and hoping the notes would make it to the two women successfully.Here's Halse and Green on the trek to Everest Base Camp.Lee & Mandy/Frugal TravellersMeanwhile, Halse and Kirsty were walking as fast as they could to catch up -- so much so, they ended up overtaking Green and Murray. Eventually, the group were reunited in the small village of Jorsale, between the entrance to the Sagarmatha National Park and Namche Bazaar.From there, they headed to the 5,357-meter Gokyo Ri peak, because Kirsty had read that the view of Everest was more impressive and that the trail didn't have as many trekkers. It turned out to be a highlight of the trip.""We were walking on a frozen lake, which if I'd thought about it, I think I would have been scared, but the snow was up to our thighs,"" says Green.Related contentThe couple who fell in love in AntarcticaSix weeks in IndiaHalse and Green went on together from Nepal to India, here they are at the Taj Mahal.Lee & Mandy/Frugal TravellersBy the time they returned to Kathmandu at the end of April, Halse and Green were certain their connection was more than a fleeting holiday romance.""We realized that we wanted to be together,"" says Green.After Murray decided to fly back home to the UK and Kirsty went off on her next adventure, Green and Halse were suddenly alone for the first time. They both had six weeks before they were due to fly on to the UK -- Halse to visit her friend on a pre-arranged trip, and Green to return to work -- so the two decided to fill the time with a trip around India.They traveled largely by rail, whiling away the long journeys staring out the window and chatting to one another and fellow travelers. They reunited with Kirsty in the southern India state of Kerala, and again at Agra to visit the Taj Mahal. The trio traveled together to New Delhi, before Kirsty parted ways again.It was an amazing six weeks for Halse and Green, but they also navigated some trickier moments together -- such as when, towards the end of their trip, they fell ill. But they supported one another through these ups and downs, and ended the journey stronger than they'd started.""You can tell whether you're compatible with someone if you have to go through tough times together, and we went through some challenging traveling experiences in India, and we came out of it really well,"" says Green.By coincidence, the friend Halse was set to visit in the UK lived in Birmingham, which was only 30 minutes away from where Green was based in Coventry.""This was the amazing thing -- two people from the other side of the world met halfway, and were going in the same direction and heading to the same place,"" says Green.When Green got home, he dumped his backpack, went to see his parents and told them he'd be heading to Birmingham the following day to see Halse.""I met this Kiwi girl. I quite like her and she's just down the road,"" he recalls saying.Green had sent his family postcards from his travels, but hadn't mentioned that he'd met a girl. Halse, meanwhile, had written long letters home to her sister describing her chance meeting with Green.""I told my sister everything,"" Halse recalls.Her sister still has the 11-page letter Halse wrote her from Nepal, describing in detail how she felt about Green. ""Lee and I slowly developed a wonderful relationship,"" Halse wrote on March 16, 1996. ""I've never experienced anything like this before.""Related contentBoy meets girl.

The two recall walking part of England's South West Coast Path from Newquay to Penzance. They also visited cities including York, Oxford, Blackpool and London.Then Halse had to return down under -- her brother was getting married in Australia, and her grandparents were celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary in New Zealand. Halse arranged to meet up with Green again in New Zealand in six months time. Green had negotiated another sabbatical with his employers, so the couple planned a second stint traveling together. Meantime, they navigated a long distance relationship.""I think we racked up $1,000 worth of phone calls,"" says Halse of this period. ""We wrote to each other, we wrote aerograms.""Back in Auckland, Halse busied herself working. She missed Green, but she worried that he was finding the separation even harder going.""Lee was pining, he was working crazy hours at the Post Office,"" says Halse. ""He was sounding more and more depressed as the time went on.""""I decided 'screw it.' We discussed things and I decided to fly back to the UK to spend the four months with Lee and then start traveling together from there.""Halse arrived back in the UK on Christmas Day 1996. Green was waiting for her at the airport. ""I'd just come from New Zealand and everyone was tanned and because it was December, Lee was pale, and he looked very different,"" says Halse. ""It was a bit of a shock at first. But then we got on the bus, went back, and we were together in Coventry for four months.""It was an opportunity for Halse to get to know Green's family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly. And when these four months came to an end, Halse and Green flew to New Zealand, before traveling together through Central and South America for the next six months.Related contentShe flew from Australia to England for a first dateA lifetime of travelGreen and Halse at Auckland Airport in 1997, about to embark on their travels.Lee & Mandy/Frugal TravellersFrom there, Halse and Green started a pattern that would continue for many years.

Their nuptials took place in New Zealand in August 2001, and Green's family flew over from the UK for the celebrations. The couple were married in Halse's mother's backyard.""We set up food and drink in the double garage, then later on various family members played guitars, and we sat around singing until the early hours of the morning,"" recalls Halse. ""It was such a great day, and definitely not a conventional wedding.""The couple in Thailand in 1999.Lee & Mandy/Frugal TravellersThe couple had also bonded early on over a commitment to living frugally, and prioritizing spending money on travel. They say years avoiding splurging allowed them to retire in 2017, when they were in their late 40s.""We worked out that if we live on a budget of between 20 and 25 US dollars a day, we can travel indefinitely,"" says Halse.Post-retirement, one of the first items on their travel agenda was a return trip to Nepal, just over 20 years since they'd first met there. This time round, Halse and Green completed the Annapurna Circuit, and also trekked to Everest Base Camp, sans porters or guides.The two say Nepal had changed in the intervening two decades, but it was incredible to be back. The couple returned to some of the teahouses they'd stayed in on that first trip, and even reencountered local people they'd met the first time round.""It's still my favorite country in the world, I think, of all the places I've been,"" says Green.

world,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/watkins-tower-london-eiffel/index.html,How London almost got its own Eiffel Tower,,"(CNN) — Somewhere beneath the pitch of England's national stadium in Wembley, London, lie the foundations of what could have been the city's tallest building. Inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Great Tower of London was poised to surpass it in height and reach almost 1,200 feet.Instead, it never went past the first construction stage, which came to be known as the ""London Stump."" It was demolished almost 120 years ago, leaving behind an unfulfilled dream and large concrete foundations that were rediscovered in 2002, when the current stadium was built to replace an older one. So what went wrong?The tower was the brainchild of Edward Watkin, a British politician and railway tycoon whose previous endeavors included a failed attempt to build a tunnel under the English Channel, more than 100 years before the current Eurotunnel began construction.'Bigger the better'One of the tower designs that didn't get picked. The Public Domain Review""Watkin was a born entrepreneur and he loved big ideas -- the bigger the better,"" says Christopher Costelloe, an expert on Victorian architecture and an inspector of historic buildings at public heritage organization Historic England. ""I think he had a tendency to get so excited with his ideas that he often plowed ahead before thinking about how practical or financially viable they were.""The Eiffel Tower, which opened in 1889, quickly became a popular tourist attraction and its construction costs were recouped in a matter of months. At the same time, Watkin was looking for ways to attract more passengers onto his Metropolitan Railway -- which would later become the Metropolitan line on the London Underground.The railway passed through Wembley, then a rural hamlet northwest of central London, where Watkin had purchased land to create an amusement park: ""It was meant to be the Disneyland of its day, or the successor to the early 19th-century leisure parks like Battersea Park in London or Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen,"" says Costelloe. What better than a tower taller than the Eiffel to convince Londoners to board a train to get there?Watkin had the audacity to ask Gustave Eiffel himself to design it, but the French engineer refused on patriotic grounds. His plan B was an international design competition, with a first prize of 500 guineas, about $80,000 in today's money. He received 68 submissions, not all of them realistic. One was 2,000 feet tall and was meant to have a train running halfway to the top, on a spiraling railway. Another was designed as an ""aerial colony"" with sky gardens, museums and galleries, as well as a reproduction of the Great Pyramid at the top. Most, however, matched the aesthetics of the Eiffel, and it was one of these that Watkin selected as the winner, submitted by London architects Stewart, McLaren and Dunn. ""The winning proposal was a more slender version of the Eiffel Tower. Very similar in its overall profile, but the structure was sort of skinnier,"" says Costelloe. At 1,200 feet, it was also about 175 feet taller than its Parisian counterpart, which was the world's tallest building at the time.Related contentRobert Bartini: The world's most mysterious aircraft designerA not-so-popular attractionThe first, and only, completed stage of the tower.AlamyAll entries were collected in a catalog, published in 1890, which described the project in detail and revealed that the London tower would be ""much more spacious"" than the Eiffel and include ""restaurants, theaters, shops, Turkish baths, promenades, winter gardens and a variety of other amusements,"" all reachable via a recent invention, the electric elevator. An observation deck would offer panoramic views and astronomical observations, facilitated by the ""purity of air"" found at such an ""immense height.""After the initial fanfare, however, the proposed design was scaled down to make it cheaper to build, and the legs were reduced from the original eight to four, the same number as the Eiffel. Construction began in 1892, and the first stage -- approximately 150 feet tall -- was finished three years later. Wembley Park had opened the year before and was enjoying moderate success, but the tower still had a long way to go -- and there was something wrong with it. ""When they reached the first stage, it soon became clear that the building was subsiding. Not so badly that they couldn't use it, but they certainly realized they'd have big problems if they carried on building it higher, increasing the strain on the legs,"" says Costelloe.Although it was opened to the public and elevators were installed, the tower was doomed. ""One of the main problems was that Watkin died in 1901,"" Costelloe adds. ""He had been the driving force behind the project and with his death all that was left was a rational calculation of costs and benefits. People could go up to the first stage, but that wasn't quite high enough to get the sort of panoramic views you'd get from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and the surrounding area wasn't particularly developed or spectacular. ""There just weren't enough visitors to pay for finishing it."" Related contentThe UK wants to build one of the world's most ambitious bridgesTallest in townOnce Watkin died, the impetus for building the tower was lost.Herbert Barraud/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesA year after Watkin's death, the tower was declared unsafe and closed down. Shortly after, it was demolished with dynamite. The surrounding Wembley area, however, continued to flourish as an industrial and residential London suburb. In 1923, a stadium, which would later be known as the original Wembley Stadium, was erected on the former site of the tower. Its demolition to make way for the current Wembley Stadium eventually unearthed the tower's foundations, when work to lower the level of the new pitch was undertaken. It was a late reminder of the failed tower, also referenced by a pub in the area called ""Watkin's Folly"" (it closed permanently in 2019).Remarkably, Watkin's Tower would still be London's tallest building today, surpassing The Shard skyscraper by almost 160 feet. But would it be an iconic landmark like the Eiffel Tower? Probably not, says Costelloe: ""It would still have been a very big structure on the skyline, but seen only in certain views,"" he says.  ""Not being in the center of London, it would never have had the sort of dominating focus that the Eiffel Tower has in Paris."""

world,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-travel-covid-19/index.html,Traveling to Italy during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,,"Editor's Note — Coronavirus cases are in flux across the globe. Health officials caution that staying home is the best way to stem transmission until you're fully vaccinated. Below is information on what to know if you still plan to travel, last updated on February 9.(CNN) — If you're planning to travel to Italy, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic. The basicsItaly renewed its state of emergency status on December 14 and will remain so until at least March 31. Case numbers are being continuously monitored, and regions are following a traffic light-style system with varying restrictions dependent on hospital capacity and infection rates.New restrictions on entry have been brought in, including testing requirements for EU arrivals for the first time. Entry is largely limited to residents of the European Union, plus a select list of non-EU countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. The entry regulations differ depending on a traveler's vaccination status and whether they've recently recovered from Covid.Since December 6, a tightening of rules means it is now difficult for unvaccinated people to carry out day-to-day activities. Masks must be worn at all times, including outside.What's on offer in ItalyThis is one of Europe's big hitters, known for its historic cities of art such as Florence, one-off wonders such as Venice and the seat of the Roman Catholic Church in Rome. Incredible food, fantastic wine, unspoiled countryside and a string of beach resorts mean it's always in demand. Who can goItaly's borders have been open to visitors since early 2021, with some restrictions in place. The rules were last updated on February 1 and are valid until March 15.Countries currently allowed in are divided into two lists:List C is for Europe: Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Denmark (including Faroe Islands and Greenland), Estonia, Finland, France (including Guadalupe, Martinique, Guyana, Reunion and Mayotte), Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal (including the Azores and Madeira), Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. List D, which was updated on February 1, now comprises the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, UAE, Indonesia, Japan, Israel, Kuwait, New Zealand, Peru, Qatar, Rwanda, UK, South Korea, USA, Uruguay, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Note that Kosovo has been removed from this list.The rest of the world is classified as List E. Only essential travel is allowed from these destinations. However, leisure travel is allowed from Aruba, Cuba, Dominican Republic, French Polynesia, Maldives, Mauritius, Oman, Phuket (Thailand), Seychelles, Sharm El Sheikh and Marsa Alam (Egypt), Singapore and Turkey on ""Covid-free touristic corridors."" The criteria for this is strict: Travelers must travel in a controlled group with specific tour operators, staying in government-selected accommodation. See below for entry regulations. On January 14, Italy lifted the travel ban on arrivals from eight southern African countries: South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini. They now move to list E.What are the restrictions?As of December 23, anyone flying to or from Italy must wear an FFP2 mask -- for more information, see below. Regardless of their vaccination status, all visitors must fill in a self-declaration form. Additionally, the following requirements must be met, depending on where you are arriving from.Arrivals from List C (EU countries) must present a certificate of a completed vaccination cycle within the last nine months, certificate of recovery from Covid-19, or a negative test result, taken within 24 hours (antigen) or 48 hours (PCR) of departure.Non-vaccinated and partially vaccinated EU arrivals must additionally quarantine for five days on arrival, and then test negative before exiting quarantine.Non-vaccinated children under 12 do not have to quarantine, as long as they are traveling with fully vaccinated adults.Travelers arriving from List D countries must present proof of vaccination (with the conditions above), along with a negative test, taken within 72 hours of arrival (PCR) or within 24 hours of arrival (antigen). For those coming from the UK, the PCR test must be taken within 48 hours. Travelers from Canada, Japan and the US may show proof of recovery from Covid-19, instead of proof of vaccination.Those who do not present the correct evidence -- or unvaccinated arrivals -- must quarantine for five days, and test at the start and end of quarantine.Arrivals coming from List E countries (essential travel only) must also present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival, or a negative antigen test taken within 24 hours of arrival. They must then quarantine for 10 days, and test negative to leave quarantine.If traveling on a certified ""Covid-free touristic corridor"" from valid List E countries, you must must be fully vaccinated or have a recovery certificate. You must also present a negative test 48 hours before travel, take another test on arrival, and a third in Italy if staying more than seven days.Wherever they are arriving from, children under six years old do not have to take a test, though those aged between six and 18 do. Furthermore, unvaccinated kids follow the rules their parents are following -- in other words, if their accompanying parent does not have to quarantine, neither does the child.What's the Covid-19 situation?As the first hit European country, Italy has been through a lot. Restrictions have consistently brought things under control, with Italy holding out longer than European neighbors in each subsequent wave. However, the winter waves of 2020-21 and 2021-22 have taken huge tolls.Italy holds Europe's second highest death toll (after the UK), passing the milestone of 100,000 deaths on March 8, 2021. Nearly 11.8 million people have been infected to date, with the death toll at 149,512 as of February 9. With the arrival of the Omicron variant, case numbers soared. Cases reached a record high the week of January 10, with 1,269,976 cases recorded. Before Omicron, the record infection rate for the pandemic was 248,000 infections in a week, registered in November 2020. Having said that, it looks like the peak may have been reached. In the week leading up to February 9, new infection rates stood at just under 650,000. That's half what they were at their January peak.Around 90% of the adult population has now been fully vaccinated, and children are now being vaccinated as well. A vaccine mandate for the over-50s was announced on January 6. All over-18s can now receive a booster dose four months after their second dose.App Immuni uses Bluetooth to track contact with potential infection. ""Green passes"" were introduced in summer 2021 with ""super green passes"" from December 6 (see below). What can visitors expect Italian regions are currently graded by their infection and hospitalization rates, running from white (lowest risk) through yellow and amber to red (highest risk). The zoning rules have changed for 2022, meaning that the previous severe restrictions of orange and red zones are a thing of the past. This year, what you can and can't do depends more on your vaccination status than the zone you are in. Those who are fully vaccinated and boosted, with a super green pass (see below) are not subject to any zone restrictions, even in a red zone.Note that, even if you're happy to abide by the zoning rules, proof of vaccination is required for most everyday activities, from entering shops to taking public transport.Note that children under the age of 12 are exempt from the vaccination requirements. As of February 7, there are no red regions, but six orange regions: Valle d'Aosta, Abruzzo, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Marche, Piedmont and Sicily. There are three white zones: Basilicata, Molise and Umbria. That leaves the rest of the country yellow. A nationwide mask mandate since December 23 means that you must wear a mask at all times, even when walking outside in the street, or risk fines of around $450. The outdoor part of this mask mandate will end February 11. However, masks must still be worn indoors, including FFP2 masks on public transport. Individual cities can also bring in outdoor mask mandates in crowded places.That mask must be a safer FFP2 model on public transport (including flights to and from Italy), and during any kind of performance whether indoors or outdoors -- cinemas, theaters, music venues and sporting events. Eating and drinking inside at these events is also banned. Any kind of event, party or concert that involves crowding in open spaces is banned until January 31. Nightclubs have also been closed.Social distancing restrictions remain in place, including on public transport -- except for high-speed trains, which can run at capacity. Authorities will be given the authority to halt any train on which a passenger is showing any symptoms of Covid-19.Only two people may sit in the back of a taxi, if they are part of the same family.The 2022 rules for the white, yellow, orange and red zones are as follows:White zones:The least restricted. The mask mandate and green pass restrictions are enforced.Yellow zones:White zone rules apply, plus: • Cinemas and live entertainment venues are capped at 50% capacity. Orange zones:Yellow zone rules apply, plus: • Numbers allowed on the ski slopes have been restricted (the exact number depends on the region). Only a limited number of ski passes will be sold each day. • On weekends, only those with a super green pass (or three vaccinations) are allowed in shopping malls. • Stadium capacity is capped at 35% indoors, 50% outdoors.• If not fully vaccinated with a booster, traveling from one comune (council area) to another is only allowed for essential reasons. Red zones:No region has so far turned red in 2022, but if they do, this would see the return of 2020/2021 restrictions -- even for the fully vaccinated and boosted.Red zone status would still mean closures of bars, restaurants, museums and entertainment venues. Restrictions on travel and a nightly curfew would be reintroduced.Green passes and super green passes:Enter almost anywhere in Italy and you will be asked to show your ""certificazione verde,"" or green pass.As of January 2022, there are two types of green pass: a basic one and a ""super green pass"" or ""certificazione verde rafforzata.""The regular pass shows that the holder has been vaccinated, has tested negative within the past 48 hours, or has recovered from the virus within the past six months.The ""super green pass"" can only be obtained through vaccination (including a booster) or previous infection, but not through testing negative.As of February 4, these are valid for six months after completing the vaccination cycle or recovering from previous infection. This has been reduced from nine months' validity. However, the government has announced plans to make the super green pass valid indefinitely for those who have been boosted. No further details have yet been announced.Currently, a green pass is required to enter any nonessential shops and services, including hairdressers, post offices and shopping centers. Only supermarkets, pharmacies, gas stations and pet stores are exempt. A super green pass is now required to eat both indoors and outdoors in bars and restaurants, as well as to access entertainment venues, museums and exhibitions, gyms, nightclubs, theme parks, ski lifts, pools, wellness centers, spas and stadiums. You must also hold the super green pass to use public transport (including internal flights and ferries), stay in hotels or attend events such as fairs, festivals and conferences.Those vaccinated in other countries are not eligible for the Italian pass, but EU vaccination passes are recognized and scanned as domestic ones are. Those holding a certificate with a QR code -- including UK NHS certificates -- can normally have their passes read as an Italian one. Check whether yours is valid by downloading the VerificaC19 app. If your QR code is not recognized by the app, or you don't have one, you must show a paper copy of your certificate from your home country. Foreign vaccine certificates are not subject to the same time limits as Italian green passes. For now, a full cycle including booster is valid indefinitely. A full initial cycle with no booster is valid six months.

world,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/18/us/jonah-santa-letters-covid-cec/index.html,This 10-year-old boy asked Santa last year for a cure for Covid-19. This year he has a new request,"By Faith Karimi, CNN","This is part of a CNN series, ""The Helpers,"" which seeks to showcase people who are going the extra mile to help others and make their communities a better place. (CNN)In their letters to Santa Claus, most kids ask for toys, dolls or maybe a new Xbox. All Jonah Simons said he wanted was a coronavirus cure to save the world. That was last year. Jonah's letter was collected through the US Postal Service's Operation Santa program and published on CNN. It was one of many that revealed the pandemic's toll on children around the country. This holiday season, the 10-year-old Florida boy is back with a different request for Santa.""Dear Santa, it's me Jonah. Do you remember me? I was the one who asked for a covid cure,"" he wrote in a letter addressed to the North Pole and shared with CNN.  ""btw, ty so much for the vaccine! You helped save lives. This year, can I please have a Santa costume to spread your joy around the world?""Read MoreLetters to Santa reveal the toll the pandemic is taking on kidsHis mother, Doe Simons, says Jonah composes his Santa letters himself, without help from his parents.With a relentless virus and threats of the Omicron variant still plaguing a weary nation, Jonah has big plans for the Santa suit.""I want to wear it and go around the neighborhood and spread Santa's joy, ask people what they want for Christmas,"" the fifth-grader told CNN. Jonah Simons' letter to Santa last year. Jonah's mother says she's not positive whether her son still believes in Santa Claus.""But Jonah has experienced Santa-like moments. For example, last year he sent his Xmas wish out into the universe and it came true to a certain extent,"" she says. ""I think writing that letter, even if he didn't believe in Santa, for him was the ability to exert some control over the problem (of the pandemic). It was his way to communicate his feelings and express what he wished would happen.""Helping others is nothing new for Jonah Jonah has been spreading joy in his community of Parkland for years. Growing up in Parkland, where a 2018 massacre left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has had an effect on Jonah and other local children, his mother says. ""What happened here had a lot of impact on children here. He was in middle school, and his school was on lockdown that day,"" she says. ""I think that like Jonah, you're getting kids here who are civic minded and want to make a difference ... When he sees the impact his help has on others, he wants to do more to help."" Jonah turned 10 in July, and in lieu of gifts he asked his family and friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. His birthday effort raised $1,000 in donations from family and friends all over --  even his favorite employees at the local Publix store, his mother says. Jonah Simons holds a photo showing his long hair before he donated it to charity for his 10th birthday this year. He also marked his birthday by donating his hair to Locks of Love, the charity that makes wigs for kids with cancer or other medical conditions.  During a year of lockdown, he teamed up with some friends and grew out his hair to nine inches. ""It was so long, I got bullied for it,"" he says. ""Some people called me a girl.""Jonah's good deeds are not limited to birthdays. He works to help his community all year, including donating and sorting food for the homeless with the organization Feeding South Florida, and packing holiday gifts for children.Doe Simons says her son's charity begins close to home with his grandparents, who are in their 90s and live nearby. Jonah takes out their garbage every week, holds car doors open for them and helps them with their walkers up the elevator, she says.Jonah with his grandparents, Nancy and Jay Simons. He's a would-be doctor whose medicine is love Jonah has long found ways to spread happiness. At age 3 he started dressing up as a doctor to visit loved ones who were ill. ""Ever since he was a little kid, he always wanted a doctors' outfit,"" says his father, Joe Simons. ""He would dress as a doctor because his medicine was love. He would visit family members at the hospital, check their vitals, talk to the nurses and prescribe a special medicine for them: love.""At the start of the pandemic, Jonah asked his parents to buy him a ""pandemic suit"" with the personal protective equipment that health care workers wear at the hospital. He told them he wanted one in case he needed to visit relatives at the hospital and prescribe his love medicine. Jonah hasn't needed to do that yet, so he mostly wears the outfit at home when he's treating his stuffed bear.""His bear is very well taken care of,"" his mother says.When family members are hospitalized, Jonah Simons dresses up as a doctor to visit them. Then he prescribes a special medicine: love. Jonah has big plans for his 11th birthday Jonah's inspiration is Heather Khalil, a Parkland woman who volunteers a lot in the community and has been awarded the Mayor's Medal of Charitable Service. ""She really turned him on to being a public servant,"" Doe Simons says. Jonah wants to be a lot of things when he grows up. Most days he tells people he wants to be a doctor, a lawyer or a police officer. But he thinks he can make a bigger difference as the leader of the free world. ""My best goal is to be a president,"" he says. ""That way, I can make changes to a lot of things and make decisions that help other people."" Until then, he'll continue helping people in his community.Jonah already has big plans for his 11th birthday next July. He's hoping that Covid-19 will be a thing of the past by then, so he can go to sleepaway camp without a mask. He's also signed up to be an ambassador for the homeless. And once again he plans to use his birthday to raise money for charity. Maybe he'll even wear his Santa suit."

We're not talking about raising money to buy people a vacation; this is food, a very, very basic thing,"" Parker said. ""We need to make sure we take care of our schools, because when we take care of our schools, we're taking care of our community.""Her endeavor, which she named Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraiser, used the money she raised to purchase, pack and distribute more than 5,200 bags full of food to students at 12 schools throughout the Durham Public Schools district.Read MoreIn the dozen schools the project helps, 98% of the students rely on the low-cost or free lunches provided by their school. For many children, it is their main source for food. But once the holidays come around, the schools close and so do their cafeterias.""Mrs. Parker has always had an army of donors and volunteers at the ready, to champion the needs of her students,"" Lakewood Elementary School Principal James Hopkins told CNN in a statement. ""What's so impressive is that these efforts have provided students across Durham the same fortune; in this case, of receiving a substantial portion of food over the extended holiday break.""""I need them to know that I love them""Parker knew she wanted to be a teacher since she was 4 years old, sitting on her mother's bedroom floor, setting up her teddy bears and pretending they were her students. ""I wanted to be a teacher all my life,"" said Parker, who has been a teacher for 11 years. ""This is what I love, it's all I ever wanted to do, I am living my dream.""Now the mother of one teaches more than 400 students, from kindergarten to fifth grade, and her love for them goes beyond the classroom.""I call my students Mrs. Parker's professors. If that tells you anything, it's that I believe in them and I love them so very much,"" Parker said. ""'I need them to know that I love them, to remind them that love is an action word. I will tell them all day, but I will also show them all day.""Her promise to keep all her student's fed began in 2015, when one of her student's parents confided in her they would not have enough food for the children to eat through the holiday break.""She told me, 'I'll be okay, I can go without eating, but I can't let my kids go without eating for two weeks.' It's really hard to know they have stuff like this going on and not to do everything I can,"" Parker said through tears. ""My husband and I started thinking, if one family is asking this question, then there must be more.""Turquoise LeJeune Parker and her husband.On December 14, 2015, Parker sent a text to everyone she knew, asking if anyone would be interested in donating money, so she could provide bags full of food to last them for the whole holiday break.Progress was slow but steady. The first year, she raised $500. Last year, she reached $55,000. But this year proved to be a record, with more than $106,000 donated from people all over the country.""It has left me speechless. I've cried about it a little every day,"" Parker said. ""It took off in a way we could have never expected.""A lifelong effort Within two weeks, Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraisers raised the money needed to purchase enough food to fill up big, brown grocery bags for thousands of children in the district.Each bag contained kid-friendly food, such as cereal, canned goods, granola bars and macaroni and cheese that can be cooked regardless of a family's living situation.""This is a community effort. This is not $106,000 out of my pocket, this is the result of us operating as a collective,"" Parker said. ""It's because of all the people who gave their time, their money, their talents to make sure our kids are taken care of.""With the help of more than 60 volunteers who accompanied Parker to a local Costco, the group purchased the food and spent days packing the bags before delivering them to each school by December 11.Volunteers packing the bags of food.""Mrs. Parker is a school district's dream teacher, a perfect mix of competence and compassion who is committed to serving young people holistically,"" Durham Public Schools said in a statement. ""Her Foodraiser addresses food insecurity head-on, particularly during a time of year when commercialism brings need to the forefront,"" the statement continued. ""Through her efforts, our food-insecure students have access to sustenance when schools are closed for the holidays. She is their lifeline.""The fundraiser's success has inspired Parker to make it a lifelong project, she said, with an aim to feed as many children as possible during both winter and spring breaks."

""People need physical touch. That's what was hard when the pandemic hit. We had to stop doing hair, we had to stop doing barber services. And that might be the nicest touch they've had all day.""As the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year, Raines will receive $100,000 to expand her work.

""You never know what anyone's going through, you know?""Raines' twin sister urged her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.""I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,"" she said. ""I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.""Initially, Beauty 2 the Streetz was small, with just Raines and her children helping to hand out food, drinks, hygiene kits and beauty products. Raines alone would color people's hair and do their makeup.But then she started livestreaming the events and posting pictures to Instagram, and Beauty 2 the Streetz soon became more well known.Licensed hair stylists, barbers, makeup artists and even big makeup companies reached out to Raines saying they wanted to help.By 2019, Raines had registered Beauty 2 the Streetz as an official non-profit with about two dozen volunteers generously offering their time and efforts to help Skid Row's residents feel beautiful.A happy ending after homeless woman's story featured on TVAs Raines' efforts evolved into a full-scale operation, with music playing and lines forming around the block, she began providing more supplies and essentials: rape whistles, tents, sleeping bags, hygiene items -- and she teamed up with local health officials to offer more services. Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to Downtown Los Angeles to feed and bring supplies to people.Then, as Covid-19 affected many organizations' efforts, services dried up. But Raines pivoted, opting for bagged lunches and a tweaked schedule -- and she kept going.In tandem with the health department, which provided masks, sanitizer and other personal protection items, Raines said her group and other L.A. County non-profits and community projects worked tirelessly to serve the unseen.

Today, as vaccination rates are on the rise and a sense of normality is returning, Raines is offering help by way of food and supplies twice a week and expanding partnerships with local groups to let this often-overlooked population know there is hope.""My sun didn't come out for 30 years. It was 30 years' worth of tomorrows before I even saw the break of day. I would be lying if I said I was always completely happy from doing this. It didn't take away the pain of my son dying.

entertainment,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/entertainment/severance-review/index.html,'Severance' puts a creepy sci-fi spin on the idea of work-life balance,"Review by Brian Lowry, CNN"," (CNN)The best kind of science fiction sometimes feels set about 10 minutes in the future, and so it is with ""Severance,"" an extremely creepy, slow-moving but instantly engrossing Apple TV+ series. Produced by Ben Stiller, the project features a stellar cast, in a show about memory that proves appropriately hard to forget.The title refers to a procedure practiced by corporate giant Lumon Industries in which employees sever their memories of what transpires at work from what happens outside, and vice versa, theoretically bringing new meaning to the phrase ""work-life balance.""Yet when a member of the team suddenly leaves, and a newcomer arrives, it upsets the chemistry within the office, triggering thoughts about what really might be motivating the practice -- and what the company might actually be doing that its robotic, happy-talking top brass appear eager to avoid.Answers don't come quickly, but the scenario becomes utterly fascinating, with Adam Scott as Mark Scout, the low-key new leader of the team; and Britt Lower as Helly, the new arrival who asks way too many questions.All told, it's enough to make even those pining for the office appreciate Zoom calls. As for the aforementioned cast, Lumon's personnel roster includes John Turturro, Christopher Walken, Zach Cherry, Tramell Tillman and Patricia Arquette, the last reuniting with Stiller after the splendid 2018 prison drama ""Escape at Dannemora.""Read MoreFor Mark, the severed memories have served a particular purpose, allowing him to create distance between work and the pain he was experiencing after the loss of his wife.Scott turns out to be the perfect Everyman, but the cast is uniformly good. Why the others would agree to this Faustian bargain is only one of the breadcrumbs that ""Severance"" takes its time sprinkling, in a series that leaves plenty of runway for more at the end of its nine episodes.Created by Dan Erickson, there's a ""Twin Peaks""-esque quality to some of the quirkier aspects of the series, such as Arquette's monotone-voiced boss informing Mark that ""A handshake is available upon request,"" the walks down impossibly long hallways or the odd obsession with melon balls at the awkward company celebrations. The show also invites comparisons to the under-appreciated AMC drama ""Rubicon"" and ahead-of-its-time 1960s series ""The Prisoner,"" given the confined setting and uncertainty about who can be trusted.""Severance"" won't be for everyone, but those drawn into its antiseptic, maze-like workspace won't be able to get enough of its provocative implications about messing around with the brain and memories, a la the movie ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""Light escapism it isn't. But until the show's fictional technology becomes reality, a series like ""Severance"" is just the sort of cerebral concept to help take one's mind off the daily grind of working 9 to 5.""Severance"" premieres Feb. 18 on Apple TV+. (Disclosure: My wife works for a division of Apple.)"

""On the way up the stairs, Defendant Trey Songz repeatedly asked Plaintiff Jane Doe if Defendant could 'get that  a**' Plaintiff Jane Doe repeatedly told Defendant Trey Songz NO and to stop asking.Read MoreAfter the alleged assault, she fled the home and ordered an Uber.

""The Police attempted to access Jane Doe's Uber account to find the location of the violent rape, but Plaintiff Jane Doe was too afraid to let them see it.

entertainment,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/entertainment/peacemaker-finale-cameos/index.html,'Peacemaker' flexes its muscles with crazy surprises in its finale,"By Brian Lowry, CNN","The following contains spoilers about the ""Peacemaker"" season finale. (CNN)Given how protective outfits like Marvel and DC are when it comes to their major characters, the ""Peacemaker"" finale on HBO Max felt genuinely surprising -- a major muscle pose by writer-director James Gunn, reflecting the extent to which he has been turned loose to play in the DC Comics sandbox.The ultra-violent series/spoof featuring John Cena closed with a pitched battle to save the world, after someone had proposed sending in the Justice League instead of relying on his ragtag group of misfits.Then, lo and behold, the Justice League actually appeared (a couple of them strictly in silhouette) once the fight was done, with cameos by Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller as Aquaman and the Flash, respectively, dropping more F-bombs than they ever could in the PG-13-rated confines of the DC universe.John Cena, Danielle Brooks and Jennifer Holland in 'Peacemaker.'For Gunn, who spun ""Peacemaker"" out of his directing stint on ""The Suicide Squad,"" that playful climax felt like a victory cigar, underscoring the extent to which DC and Warner Bros. (like CNN, units of WarnerMedia) were willing to grant him access to its characters. It also reinforces the significance of HBO Max, the company's streaming service, which has already renewed the series for a second season, announcing that Gunn would write and direct all the episodes.""They let me do whatever I want,"" Gunn told Rolling Stone, which was obvious practically from the get-go, but even more so in the finale.Read MoreThe latitude that Gunn enjoyed in producing the show further highlights why feature-film talent has been drawn to the realm of streaming, which provides creative opportunities that wouldn't be as readily available in the confines of a theatrical blockbuster. That included capping off the finale with a clear environmental message, with the alien threat noting that humans are already well on their way to destroying the planet on their own.Indeed, the hunger for such content has birthed an entire subgenre of dark and satirical superheroes, including Netflix's ""The Umbrella Academy"" and Amazon's ""The Boys,"" which will return (at least, sort of) with a series of blood-drenched animated shorts next month.At times, ""Peacemaker"" felt like it was trying too hard to be irreverent, but that reflects Gunn's creative sensibility, while sending a message to talent about what's possible in the world of streaming -- including dragging Aquaman into your show, just for fun.Want to make that project you never thought that you could? ""Come on in,"" ""Peacemaker"" seemed to say, ""the water's fine."""

Yet that front-row view of West's meteoric rise in the first two parts of this docu-trilogy then gives way to the public figure, whose quirks, contradictions and headline-making actions complicate and muddy that narrative arc.In the broadest terms, there's something fascinating about this Netflix presentation, which had its roots in Clarence ""Coodie"" Simmons identifying West's potential in 1998, while hosting a public-access show in Chicago.Within a few years, Simmons had essentially become West's videographer and companion, chronicling the ups and downs of his efforts to win the respect of Roc-a-Fella Records and launch a solo career.It's an unusually intimate portrait, following West to shows, into the studio, during his recovery from a car accident, and as he hangs out with his late mom, Donda. ""He plays tracks like Michael Jordan shoots free throws,"" Donda says.That also includes a who's-who of cameos by those who crossed his path, from Mos Def to Pharrell Williams, Jamie Foxx to Jay-Z.Read MoreAlong the way, Simmons -- who narrates the docuseries, and shares directing credit with Chike Ozah -- details his own journey, which included becoming a father and giving up the project at West's request, before returning years later and eventually putting it together as hands were idled by Covid.""Every great story begins with a vision,"" Simmons notes near the outset, and clearly, West saw himself as a major presence before he had the resume to back that up, then delivered on those promises.

At one point he chooses to turn off the camera as West embarks on an extended rant, saying that he at times found it difficult watching him on TV, ""knowing he had issues with his mental health.""Part three reflects that tension, offering rapid-fire glimpses of West controversies. In the process, ""A Kanye Trilogy"" shifts from the leisurely pace employed during his hungry years -- letting long conversations and exchanges play out -- to fast-forwarding through what's unfolded since he achieved stardom. (For those wondering, West's estranged wife, Kim Kardashian, is glimpsed briefly, but not in a significant way.)At more than 4 ½ hours over its three parts -- subtitled ""Vision,"" ""Purpose"" and ""Awakening"" -- ""jeen-yuhs"" is already the equivalent of a director's cut. Yet the film has value as what plays like a sort-of real-life version of ""A Star is Born,"" including the familiar notion that artistic genius comes at a cost.""I knew he was destined for greatness,"" Simmons says, and West's road to that pinnacle is first remarkable, then uneven once he achieved stardom. As the filmmaker says, ""A Kanye Trilogy"" could have -- and just in terms of presenting a more cohesive story, probably should have -- ended there.""jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy"" premieres Feb. 16 on Netflix."

Director Joel Souza was also injured in the shooting which occurred when Baldwin practiced a draw with a revolver and fired the weapon.The lawsuit, filed in Santa Fe, alleges numerous industry standard violations by Baldwin and others charged with safety on the set, attorney Brian Panish announced in a news conference Tuesday.The lawsuit claims the production companies and producers ""cut corners"" and ""chose to hire the cheapest crew available,"" specifically noting that they ""knowingly hired a wholly unqualified armorer,"" and required her to split time in a second role as assistant props master.""We continue to cooperate with the authorities to determine how live ammunition arrived on the 'Rust' set in the first place. Any claim that Alec was reckless is entirely false. He, Halyna and the rest of the crew relied on the statement by the two professionals responsible for checking the gun that it was a 'cold gun' -- meaning there is no possibility of a discharge, blank or otherwise,"" Aaron Dyer, attorney for Baldwin and other producers of ""Rust,"" said in a statement to CNN. ""This protocol has worked on thousands of films, with millions of discharges, as there has never before been an incident on a set where an actual bullet harmed anyone.""Read MoreBoth armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed and prop master Sarah Zachry are named in the lawsuit, along with assistant director Dave Halls, who, according to a previously filed affidavit, handed the gun to Baldwin just prior to the shooting. Halls' attorney said he was not responsible for checking the gun.Serge Svetnoy, a ""Rust"" crew member, shared what he called the ""last photo"" of Halyna Hutchins on the film set in New Mexico. Svetnoy tagged Hutchins in the photo, which he posted to Facebook. Hutchins -- wearing a pair of headphones over a tan hat, with a puffy jacket -- is seen to the right of the film camera, with Alec Baldwin in the background.  It's unclear from Svetnoy's Facebook post when the photo was actually taken.
During an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos late last year, Baldwin said he and Hutchins were going over how she wanted to position his hand before the gun went off, saying then, ""I would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger.""""The gun was supposed to be empty; I was told I was handed an empty gun,"" Baldwin said in the interview. ""There's only one question to be resolved ... only one. And that is, where did the live round come from?""Two crew members have told CNN that Gutierrez Reed mishandled weapons on a previous film project. She did not reply to CNN's request for comment regarding those allegations. Gutierrez Reed is now suing the movie's gun and ammunition supplier, accusing them of mixing up dummy rounds with live ammunition.Safety concerns raised by the crew remained unaddressed, the lawsuit states, citing 15 specific safety protocols they allege were violated, including the use of a real gun instead of a dummy weapon, use of live ammunition on set, and improper storage.""There are regulations and guidelines in place today that should prevent something like this from happening, but they need to be enforced,"" Panish said. ""Had they been followed, this never would have happened.""Panish, who represents Hutchins' husband and young son, also showed a nearly 10-minute video that included a short, highly-produced, animated reenactment of the shooting that led to the ""senseless and tragic death of Halyna Hutchins."" The details of the reenactment are based on ""factual allegations in the complaint made by the Hutchins Family,"" according to a slate at the beginning of the video.CNN has also reached out to Halls, Gutierrez Reed, Zachry, and the 'Rust' production company for comment.CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report."

Though often ridiculed, or dismissed as ""chick flicks,"" these movies appeal to something we all crave: love. To watch these movies is to be charmed -- don't we all, on some level, want to believe in a happy ending? That everything will work out, that everyone is worthy of love?The rom-com is a genre that has existed for decades, since the very beginning of film. But, like any genre, it has had its duds; films that ring hollow, shallow depictions of one of the most beautiful aspects of life. In honor of Valentine's Day, and a celebration of love, CNN pondered that eternal question: What makes a romantic comedy click?We picked and prodded, we studied and surveyed. This is what we found.ChemistryRead More""Pretty Woman"" (1990)Together, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts hum synchronously; even their chemistry has chemistry, were it possible. Gere reportedly refused the role initially, but he was eventually talked into it by Roberts -- her charm was apparently irresistible, and it spills onto the screen. Who could deny Roberts' Vivian? She melts both the icy Gere and the audience. The tension between them crackles; the improvised scene when Gere snaps a necklace box shut shows an easy playfulness between the two. Good chemistry can't be manufactured, but audiences will immediately know if it's not there. Lucky for us, Gere and Roberts swim in it. Believable couple""Brown Sugar"" (2002)Childhood best friends make the most believable couples, and nothing exhibits that more than ""Brown Sugar."" Sanaa Lathan's Sidney is a passionate hip-hop journalist and Taye Diggs' Dre an idealistic talent scout for a record company. Their love is a playful one, and though he's with another woman, they are experts in each other the way only long time friends can be. At a bridal shower, Sidney knows more about Dre than his betrothed, an uncomfortable moment that shows how skewed the situation is. It's not just the script: Lathan and Diggs sell the deep friendship in their mutual casual manner -- a nonchalant hand on a shoulder, a secret smile. The couple isn't just believable, we believe in them. It's what makes the movie, and any good rom-com, work.Romantic rivalDarryl (Eriq La Salle), ""Coming to America"" (1988)Every rom-com needs a romantic rival -- a person at whom we can joyously jeer while rooting for the main couple. Of course, sometimes this trope is slightly averted, like in ""You've Got Mail,"" where Tom Hanks seamlessly takes on the role of both love rival and interest. Nevertheless, as exhibited by ""Coming to America,"" to appreciate the goodness of Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy), we must have the counterweight of Darryl (Eriq La Salle). Victory tastes sweetest when it's fought for, and the rivals make it a battle. Obstacle ""Starstruck"" (2021)When Jessie (Rose Matafeo) gets on that bus to the airport, she is going home, far away from the arms of Tom (Nikesh Patel). The obstacles that plague this couple are endless, and a product of the different worlds they inhabit: His glitzy movie star lifestyle clashes with her broke, odd-job existence. Over the show's first season, the audience sees the way the couple is held back both externally and internally, their subtle relationship insecurities revealed slowly across six episodes. Will they actually get together? There are moments where we're unsure. But, in the end, they do -- a rekindling made all the more fiery by the work it took to get there. Comic relief best friendGeorge (Rupert Everett), ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" (1997) Were it not for the charming George, deliciously portrayed by Rupert Everett, Julia Roberts' Julianne would be completely unsympathetic, the villain of her own story, a selfish conwoman trying to break up an innocent couple. Here is a companion so willing to meet his friend at her most deranged that he pretends to be her extremely eager fiancé. He may be miffed at Julianne for dragging him into her mess, but he goes along with the facade and takes it to the nth degree. True, George fills the stereotypical ""Gay Best Friend"" role, and faking heterosexuality for much of the film is the punchline to most of his jokes. But Everett elevates the role to nearly run away with the film. See also: Judy Greer in ""27 Dresses,"" Kathryn Hahn in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" DeWanda Wise in ""Someone Great"" Humor""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (2001)If romance is the beating heart of a film, comedy is every other organ that supports it. It's right there in the genre's name, and comedy is essential to a romantic film's success -- audiences want to be charmed, not reminded of their own relationship woes.A rom-com heroine who falls flat as often as she falls in love, Bridget Jones is endearingly embarrassing. The unlucky-in-love Brit wraps herself up in bed comforters to down a pint of Ben & Jerry's, sings karaoke poorly but wholeheartedly, and generally feels uncomfortable in her own skin -- that's an everywoman audiences can relate to. Though they may giggle at her pratfalls, they see themselves in her, too. And because her relatable failures are stretched to a cinematic degree, it's funny and not heartbreaking -- it's likely that few viewers have ever been left to fend for themselves at a garden party dressed like a Playboy bunny. Absurd job""The Incredible Jessica James"" (2017)A great rom-com transcends the bounds of our reality by casting its protagonists in roles that a.) allow them to purchase enviably spacious, well-furnished homes and b.) often introduce them to their love interest. Take the three stars of ""The Incredible Jessica James"" -- LaKeith Stanfield plays a man who designs wooden phone cases for a living. Jessica Williams' titular character works with a children's theater, and Chris O'Dowd developed an app that texts users' parents for them. The men, especially, do well for themselves. These jobs do not exist, or if they do, they are available only to the very wealthy (with the exception of a children's theater staffer -- that's real, if typically low-paying). And this is one of the great powers of a sharp rom-com: It exists in a world similar to our own, but fantastical, too -- one where you can date a techbro in New York City who's actually tolerable. Speech""10 Things I Hate About You"" (1999)The speech scene in a rom-com is a common one, but here it is given the Shakespearan treatment. Taken by itself, Kat's (Julia Stiles) poem about Patrick (Heath Ledger) is almost saccharine, an edge some rom-com speeches teeter. But when Stiles' voice cracks and eyes water while reading it aloud, there is nothing cheesy about the moment. ""But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, Not even close, Not even a little bit, Not even at all,"" she recites, and the camera switches to Ledger's anguished gaze. It's a pain the audience feels, too. Perfect bedroom/apartment/home""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" (2018)Lara Jean's bedroom, like those of most teens, is often cluttered with clothes, her desk overflowing with books and beauty products and the general paraphernalia of a teenage girl with a tendency to swoon. But her room is also painted a divine turquoise with a mural of blossoming branches. It contrasts perfectly with her pale pink bedspread and magenta throw. For a high schooler, she certainly can decorate. See also: Mia Thermopolis's converted fire house in ""The Princess Diaries,"" complete with a fireman's pole for easy exits.Larger-than-life city""Sleepless in Seattle"" (1993)New York City tends to be a mainstay of a rom-com, but here Nora Ephron focuses on the Pacific Northwest as a backdrop to Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's love. Though other cities are featured in the movie, none are portrayed as elegantly as Seattle. There's the oysters, Pike Place Market, and so, so much water -- the beach, the lake, the houseboat. Here, Seattle's gorgeous blues replace the usual generic skyscraper-filled city, and to great effect. When Hanks gazes out to the sea from his houseboat, the lights sparkling off the water's surface, the magnitude of his grief is palpable. It's as deep as the water beneath him. Rom-com MVPMeg Ryan (in everything)When all else fails, cast Meg Ryan. Her effusive charisma, sharp wit and gusty takes on lovesick women are the pinnacle of the genre. To use our aforementioned ""Sleepless in Seattle"" example, who else could have sold a burgeoning romance based solely on the sound of someone's voice over the radio? Who else could have made that diner scene in ""When Harry Met Sally"" so charming? Or believably fall in love with a time-traveling 19th century duke in ""Kate & Leopold""? Her very being elevates even the most mundane rom-com into authenticity. Whatever love story she sells, we want in. "

entertainment,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/entertainment/marry-me-review/index.html,'Marry Me' shines the spotlight on Jennifer Lopez in a 'meet dumb' rom-com,"Review by Brian Lowry, CNN"," (CNN)Designed to showcase Jennifer Lopez playing a character that could hardly be called a reach, ""Marry Me"" trades in the ""meet cute"" rom-com formula for ""meet dumb."" Lopez still gets ample opportunities to sing a hummable soundtrack, but even within the genre's parameters, the silly premise deals the movie a blow from which it never entirely recovers.The fascination with Lopez's personal life -- and her romantic history with other famous folk -- sometimes overshadows her talents, which is an underlying theme in this film that she also produced. Her return to this territory will surely represent a cause for Valentine's Day celebration in some quarters, after past entries like ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""Maid in Manhattan.""That said, the set-up feels especially strained, even before you get to the ""Notting Hill""-like notion of the special challenges when an ordinary guy becomes involved with a glamorous entertainer. In a movie that hinges on an impulsive decision, it's hard not to wish somebody had spent at least a little more time agonizing about the script, which is actually based on a graphic novel.Lopez's Kat Valdez is on top of the world, about to marry fellow musical superstar Bastian (played by singer Maluma) during a televised concert.

But of course, the plot calls for Kat and Charlie to try maintaining the pretense of a connection a few months for face-saving purposes, just long enough for the pop princess and public-school proctor to begin appreciating each other's qualities, with the threat that she might reconcile with Bastian looming over the nascent relationship.A nice guy and a single dad, Charlie is quick to admit that ""I don't fit"" in Kat's under-the-spotlight sphere, which hinges to an unhealthy degree on live streams and followers. The Universal release also goes out of its way to synergistically incorporate sister NBC properties, with ""Today's"" Hoda Kotb and ""The Tonight Show's"" Jimmy Fallon receiving nearly as much screen time as any of the supporting players except perhaps Bradley and Sarah Silverman as Charlie's friend and coworker.Marking the feature debut for TV director Kat Coiro (""Dead to Me"" and the upcoming ""She-Hulk""), ""Marry Me"" conjures a few sweet moments, lots of music, and a ""King for a Day"" quality in Charlie's plight, with Kat's jet-setting lifestyle and paparazzi suddenly stalking his every move.A genre reborn: Inside the evolution of the rom-comYet while the movie is unabashed about its rom-com roots, such fare isn't exactly rare these days, having simply migrated from theaters to venues like Netflix, which seems to churn them out in bunches. (Notably, the movie will premiere simultaneously on NBC's streaming service Peacock as well as theaters.)Admittedly, the mere union of Lopez and this light-hearted premise will be enough to prompt some to say, ""I do."" Strictly on its merits, though, ""Marry Me"" is the kind of generic offer all but the most hopeless romantics can afford to refuse.""Marry Me"" premieres Feb. 11 in US theaters and on Peacock.

(CNN)With the benefit of hindsight, ""The Book of Boba Fett"" was part epilogue, a whole lot of prologue, and one giant valentine to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, attempting to put a different spin on peripheral players and underdeveloped life forms.That was a lot (indeed, a bit too much) to juggle, as became clear when the series took an abrupt turn back into what felt more like a third season of ""The Mandalorian"" in the midst of its seven-episode run. Boba Fett might have great armor, but as characters go, the series exposed a rather hollow shell.Still, series creator Jon Favreau and collaborators Dave Filoni and Robert Rodriguez clearly had plenty of action figures with which they wanted to play, all while maneuvering to reunite the central duo from ""The Mandalorian.""The action-packed finale included a protracted showdown between Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) and his ragtag roster of allies against the criminal Pyke syndicate, which not only had them outnumbered but seemingly outflanked. The ensuing battle -- in the season's longest installment -- contained numerous last-minute rescues and an old-style western gunfight, pitting Boba against the bounty hunter Cad Bane (again voiced by Corey Burton), another fan favorites imported from the ""Star Wars"" animated universe, which planted fertile seeds for the live-action fare.One recurring theme in ""Book of Boba Fett"" sought to showcase residents of Tatooine that played minor roles in the original trilogy in a different light. Here, that included Boba's (somewhat) tamed Rancor monster joining in the final battle, which followed the more sympathetic view of the Tuskens during Boba's time with them in earlier episodes.Read MoreDespite rousing moments the series couldn't entirely overcome its awkward structure, which underscored that ""Boba Fett"" existed as an offshoot of ""The Mandalorian."" The final episodes thus went about the task of bringing that title character back together with Grogu, a.k.a. Baby Yoda, after he had found a new home and destiny under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker. (An encore appearance by Mark Hamill, along with Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka Tano, elevated ""fan service"" to almost giddy extremes.)While that term is usually evoked derisively, Favreau and Filoni have embraced the idea of giving the audience what it wants -- less out of a sense of obligation than because that's what they want to see too.That said, after the crescendo of that Luke cameo at the end of season two, one suspects the reunion was motivated at least in part by Disney's desire to ensure that it can keep peddling ""Baby Yoda"" merchandise. Overall, ""Book of Boba Fett"" represented an interesting if not wholly successful experiment, adding pieces to a ""Star Wars"" live-action arsenal for Disney+ that can now look forward to eagerly anticipated series featuring Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka -- characters with more heft than Boba Fett ultimately brought to the party.Given the tone of these shows, think of this as a very expensive ""B"" western. As for those who might have been skeptical whether Boba Fett, given his limited screen time through the years, could sustain his own program, the way ""The Book of Boba Fett"" unfolded, for better and worse, basically rendered that question moot."

""My brother would never do something like that, but I'm still guilty by association. That's what they call it, right?"" Janet said. ""He didn't have that in him.""'Janet Jackson' tells the singer's story, but it's clear who's in controlShe also said that although her brother made a monetary settlement with the boy's family, it was not an admission of guilt. ""He just wanted it to go away, but (the payout) looks like you're guilty,"" she said.Read MoreIn the second hour, Jackson spoke about the 2004 incident in which Justin Timberlake ripped off part of her top at the end of their Super Bowl halftime performance, exposing her breast. ""We talked once, and he said, 'I don't know if I should come out and make a statement,'"" she said. ""I said, 'Listen, I don't want any drama for you. They're aiming all of this at me.' So I just said if I were you, I wouldn't say anything.""Jackson said that she experienced backlash not just from fans but professionally. The documentary touches on her being disinvited to the Grammy Awards as a result. Her boyfriend at the time, Jermaine Dupri, spoke on camera about that time period and said that he ultimately stepped away from his duties on the Grammys' board because, ""I felt like they were disrespectful to Janet, and I resigned at that point."" Jackson also said, ""Honestly, this whole thing was blown way out of proportion. Of course, it was an accident. That should not have happened, but everyone is looking for someone to blame, and that's got to stop. Justin and I are very good friends, and we will always be very good friends. We spoke just a few days ago, and he and I have moved on, and it's time for everyone else to do the same.""Shortly after the documentary aired, Timberlake began trending on Twitter.The first part of the ""Janet Jackson"" documentary premiered Friday night. Both parts cover her decades-long career, growing up with her brothers as they rose to fame in The Jackson Five and the complicated family dynamics with her father Joe Jackson as her manager -- as well as her becoming a mother later in life.

Shonda Rhimes caught lightning in a bottle for Netflix with ""Bridgerton,"" but her latest creation is less likely to have tongues wagging.Rhimes has populated the show with a number of familiar faces from her ABC/""Scandal"" days, but the marquee parts go to Julia Garner (""Ozark""), sporting an accent seemingly patterned after Balki in ""Perfect Strangers,"" and Anna Chlumsky (""Veep""). Even if Garner's character, Anna Delvey, actually sounded this way, listening to it for nine episodes borders on becoming a distraction at best, and an ear-bending ordeal at worst.While taking liberties with the story, the underlying bones of it are pretty sensational: Delvey, a ""fake heiress,"" beguiled the Manhattan elite and banks alike, worming her way into high society before the walls came crashing down and landed her in a courtroom.Julia Garner as Anna Delvery in 'Inventing Anna' (David Giesbrecht/Netflix).Delvey lived the good life, creating an image that fooled plenty of people and left many reluctant to discuss their relationships with her. That included running up expenses like a $62,000 trip to Morocco, with a friend (played by ""Scandal's"" Katie Lowes) holding the bill.Anna's story was a tough one to crack, due in part to the reticence of those she fooled. Enter Chlumsy's Vivian, who doggedly pursues Anna and her friends, trying to expose not just what happened but who Anna really is and where that peculiar accent might have originated. (The show is based on a New York magazine article by Jessica Pressler.)Read MoreStrictly as a viewing proposition it doesn't help that most of the episodes run more than an hour, which breeds a certain flabbiness in the storytelling. The same goes for a structure that shifts the focus to a different one of Anna's marks in each chapter, jumping back and forth in time before reaching the trial and eventually deciding her fate.Along the way Vivian and Anna have several prison interviews, but we're expected to accept that the reporter has bonded with her — or at least finds her oddly endearing, for reasons that frankly seem mystifying — even as she struggles to meet her deadline, hold her life together and, oh yeah, have a baby.If that sounds like a lot, it is, with a tone that's often whimsical. The flashbacks generally work better than Vivian's part of the story, which provides a reminder that portraying the practice of journalism in drama can be a thorny proposition, with a whole lot of misfires for every ""All the President's Men.""Those criticisms don't completely undercut the meatiness of the story, and the schadenfreude of how all these privileged masters and mistresses of the universe were so easily deceived. But it does make ""Inventing Anna,"" finally, a bit of a slog — a series that seeks to be a little too inventive for its own good.""Inventing Anna"" premieres Feb. 11 on Netflix."

africa,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/africa/elephant-ivory-trafficking-dna-scn/index.html,Tracing DNA of related elephants reveals illegal ivory trafficking networks,"By Ashley Strickland, CNN","Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. (CNN)African elephants have drastically dwindled as targets of the illegal ivory trade, but the DNA contained within their tusks is pointing to the very criminal networks that poached them.Researchers used genetic testing on ivory shipments seized by law enforcement and were able to trace the international crime ring shipping the ivory from Africa. The team tested more than 4,000 elephant tusks from 49 different seizures, made between 2002 and 2019, across 12 different African countries. The findings published Monday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.The study establishes familial connections between the elephants that are being poached for their ivory tusks and reveals the poaching and shipping practices and interconnectedness of the traffickers. This kind of DNA detective work can expose the tactics employed by transnational criminal organizations, believes the research team, comprised of scientists and US Department of Homeland Security special agents. These illicit organizations have operated out of Africa for decades, leading to the heavy decline of thousands of elephants in recent years, according to the study.Read MoreElephant DNA helps authorities make $3.5 million international ivory trafficking bust""These methods are showing us that a handful of networks are behind a majority of smuggled ivory, and that the connections between these networks are deeper than even our previous research showed,"" said lead study author Samuel Wasser, a University of Washington professor of biology and co-executive director of the Center for Environmental Forensic Science, in a statement. Linking elephant family membersDrawing connections between the separate seizures of ivory made at ports that were thousands of miles apart can create a trail of evidence and strengthen cases against those arrested for poaching and smuggling the tusks.This study builds on previous work, published by Wasser and his colleagues in 2018, which showed tusks from the same elephant were often separated and smuggled in different shipments before being seized. These identifications linked the trafficking networks that smuggled ivory from three African port cities in Kenya, Uganda and Togo.The new research broadened the DNA analysis to find elephants that were related in some way, including parents, offspring and siblings. Drawing connections between families of elephants, rather than trying to match individual tusks, helped the researchers understand the scope of the trafficking network.The three networks established in the 2018 study ""are involved with many more seizures and more connected to each other than previously discovered,"" according to the new paper.""If you're trying to match one tusk to its pair, you have a low chance of a match. But identifying close relatives is going to be a much more common event, and can link more ivory seizures to the same smuggling networks,"" Wasser said.Special Agent John Brown, study coauthor and  a criminal investigator with US Homeland Security Investigations, has worked on environmental crime issues for more than 25 years. The forensic analysis in the study can provide ""a roadmap for far-reaching multinational collaborative investigations,"" Brown said.Targeted populationsThe tusks came from both forest elephants and savannah elephants. Forest elephants represent about 6% of the remaining African elephant population and live in the humid forests of West Africa and the Congo Basin. Based on the tusk data from the seizures, tusks were heavily poached from Gabon and Republic of the Congo.DNA tests on elephant tusks expose 'three major export cartels operating in Africa'Savannah elephants roam across the grassy plains and bushlands in West and Central Africa and most of East and Southern Africa. Many of their tusks were poached in Tanzania, northern Mozambique and southern Kenya -- including some from the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area of southern Africa most recently. Then, the tusks were shipped from ports in different countries. But the fact that the separated tusks were still shipped from the same ports helped the researchers determine there were fewer networks moving mass ivory shipments than previously suspected, Wasser said.In elephant populations, females tend to remain in the same family group and males don't move very far even when they emigrate. The genetic connection between the tusks showed how the poachers were targeting specific populations. Dozens of shipments were found to have tight familial connections, some of which spanned years.""Identifying close relatives indicates that poachers are likely going back to the same populations repeatedly -- year after year -- and tusks are then acquired and smuggled out of Africa on container ships by the same criminal network,"" Wasser said. ""This criminal strategy makes it much harder for authorities to track and seize these shipments because of the immense pressure they are under to move large volumes of containers quickly through ports.""Holding traffickers accountableA small group of smuggling networks are the most likely ones responsible for large ivory shipments, which can move mass quantities of tusks on container ships. The genetic data from the tusks linked seizures from the Ivory Coast along the Atlantic Ocean to Mozambique, bordering the Indian Ocean.""There has been a lot of movement to make the sale of ivory illegal in many countries around the world,"" Wasser said. ""However, it has not had a great impact on the kinds of trade that we are talking about when we're getting these big seizures. And when I say a big seizure, it's a minimum size of a half-ton and that can go up to 10 tons or more.""The 17-year span of the study also showed how the networks have shifted to different ports over time, moving from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda to Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Criminals are often linked with one ivory shipment seizure, or ""one block of physical evidence,"" Brown said. But tracking this kind of data could help prosecutors establish links and ensure the criminals are held accountable for everything they've done. ""Extinction of species and ecological collapse through wildlife trafficking can have long-lasting, irreversible, catastrophic impacts on our global community as a whole,"" Brown said. ""So the global effort to combat these illicit crimes is paramount to protecting our environment."""

As long as we remain vigilant, and we act intensely particularly on vaccination, the continent is on track for controlling the pandemic,"" Moeti told a press briefing Thursday.Read MoreAfrica CDC says severe lockdowns no longer tool to contain COVID-19Africa has seen nearly 11 million Covid cases (3% of total cases reported globally) and around 242,000 Covid-related deaths (4.2% of globally reported fatalities) as of February 10, according to the Africa CDC. The continent still lags behind other parts of the world in vaccination as only 11% of its adult population has been fully vaccinated, the WHO said in a statement Thursday.A new phase of the pandemic Africa has battled four waves of the highly transmissible virus. The WHO Africa office said each wave of the coronavirus had come ""with higher peaks or more total new cases than the previous one."" But compared to previous waves, the fourth wave ""was over in six weeks"" and ""represents the first time a wave's surge in cases has not led to a commensurate increase in hospitalizations and deaths,"" WHO stated.Moeti, however, acknowledged that Africa's Covid infection rates could be much higher than the known figures.""We're very much aware that our surveillance systems problems that we had on the continent, with access to testing supplies... have led to an underestimation of the cases,"" she said.Pfizer-BioNTech to start producing Covid-19 vaccines in South Africa in 2022Moeti added that as Africa transitions into a new phase of the pandemic, the continent must strengthen its health systems so it is better prepared to manage future waves of infections.The WHO Africa office said it was spearheading an initiative in 15 African countries to ramp up Covid testing and provide infection prevention tools such as face masks and hand gels. The health agency also said it has, among other initiatives, increased the number of Covid laboratories in the continent from two to over 900 in two years.Last month, the head of the Africa CDC, Dr. John Nkengasong, said he feared that Covid-19 could become endemic on the continent given the slow pace of vaccination, but warned that severe lockdowns were no longer the best way to contain the virus.An estimated 40 million people were plunged into extreme poverty by the pandemic in Africa, according to a World Bank report last April, and containment measures such as lockdowns have cost the continent billions of dollars in lost gross domestic product."

Reuters could not immediately verify the images and has not spoken to other witnesses to the incident.An American teacher held in Libya for 6 weeks is now back home in the United StatesIf confirmed, an attempt to assassinate Dbeibah could aggravate the crisis over control of Libya after he said he will ignore a vote scheduled by the eastern-based parliament later on Thursday to replace him.Armed forces have mobilized more fighters and equipment in the capital over recent weeks, raising fears the political crisis could trigger fighting.Read MoreLibya has had little peace or stability since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Moammar Gadhafi, and it split in 2014 between warring factions in east and west.Dbeibah was installed in March as head of the UN-backed Government of National Unity (GNU) that was meant to unify the country's divided institutions and oversee the runup to an election in December as part of a peace process.Rival factions have been jostling for position after the election process fell apart amid disputes over the rules, including over the legitimacy of Dbeibah's own candidacy for president after he pledged not to run.The parliament, which mostly backed eastern forces during the civil war, has declared the GNU invalid and will hold a vote on Thursday to name a new prime minister to form another government.Son of former Libyan ruler Gadhafi runs for presidentDbeibah said in a speech this week that he would only hand over power after an election and the UN's Libya adviser and Western countries have said they continue to recognize the GNU.The parliament said this week that no elections would be held this year, after it and another political body amended the country's temporary constitution, dismaying the many Libyans who had registered to vote.The parliament's move to choose a new prime minister may lead to a return to the situation before Dbeibah's unity government was installed, with parallel administrations seeking to rule Libya from different cities.However, analysts say that may not immediately trigger a return to civil war.

The discoveries were made at the site of Athribis, an ancient settlement built around 200 kilometers north of Luxor. Marked with ink using reeds or hollowed sticks, the recovered pottery pieces, known as ""ostraca,"" are the remains of jars or vessels that were used as writing materials.

But the two ground technicians with Ethiopian Airlines, both of Tigrayan origin, said they felt a threat from the Ethiopian authorities that left them no choice but to stow away among crates of fresh flowers.   Both men said family members had been detained under sweeping emergency laws that have targeted ethnic Tigrayans -- and that they feared it was their turn next. The laws were imposed in November as Ethiopian government troops battle forces from the northern Tigray region in a bitter conflict that has now dragged on for 14 months. The government denies the laws targeted any particular group and recently lifted the state of emergency. A view of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on November 27. Witnesses and Ethiopia's human rights commission accused authorities of arresting people in the capital based on ethnicity, using the wider powers granted by the state of emergency.So, in the early hours of December 4, Yohannes and Gebremeskel, both 25, made a spur of the moment decision to climb into the storage section of a converted Ethiopian Airlines cargo plane that was sitting in one of the hangars at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, waiting for the early morning flight to Brussels, Belgium. As ground technicians with Ethiopia's flagship commercial airline for the past five years, they had access to the compartment for routine inspection purposes. But if their hiding place was discovered, they would face harsh punishment, they said. CNN has changed both men's names at their request for security reasons.   Read MoreFor more than three hours before take-off, they hid in the cold among the cabin crew's luggage, not far away from the plane's cargo shipment -- crates loaded with roses ready to be delivered to Europe.    ""We took the risk.

Yohannes believes these killings and detentions were motivated by their Tigrayan ethnicity and actioned under Ethiopia's new emergency laws. ""I don't know where she [his fiancée] is currently,"" he added. CNN has not been able to independently verify the deaths or imprisonment of Yohannes' relatives.

A spokeswoman for the office of Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed noted in an emailed statement to CNN that the state of emergency was lifted on January 26, 2022.  ""You would note that the Council of Ministers have today decided to lift the State of Emergency. Individuals apprehended under the SOE [State of Emergency] have been released in great numbers, over the past weeks by the security sector, following investigations,"" spokeswoman Billene Seyoum Woldeyes said. ""The SOE was never enacted to 'persecute' any group of people based on their identity,"" she said. The pair are not the only airline employees to attempt a risky escape from their home country in recent weeks. On December 1, shortly before Yohannes and Gebremeskel fled to Belgium, two other Ethiopian Airlines technicians concealed themselves in a passenger aircraft destined for Washington, DC, a spokesperson for the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed to CNN via an emailed statement. Yohannes and Gebremeskel decided to flee from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport after reports that security was more lax there following the suspension of dozens of Tigrayan guards. They had concealed themselves in the ceiling space above the seating, according to a source at Ethiopian Airlines with firsthand knowledge of the internal investigation that was launched afterward. Their journey would last more than 36 hours in total, as the plane flew from Addis Ababa via Lagos, Nigeria, and Dublin, Ireland, before finally landing at Dulles International Airport in Washington, DC.  Upon arrival in the US, the individuals were detained by the US Department of Homeland Security before later being transferred to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  CNN has also spoken to several other Tigrayan employees of Ethiopian Airlines who have fled Ethiopia in recent months through their jobs as flight crew. They told similar stories of widespread detentions of Tigrayans in Ethiopia and of targeted ethnic harassment from within the airline.      Concealed above plane crew's bunk   CNN has been unable to speak directly to the stowaways who reached Washington, DC, but the source at Ethiopian Airlines said that both men were also of Tigrayan origin.   A CBP spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that after an identification and security examination, officers discovered the two ""possessed Ethiopian Airlines employee identification cards, and that they stowed away with the intent of claiming asylum in the United States.""   ""The two Ethiopian males are presently housed at a federal detention facility pending a hearing before an immigration judge,"" the statement added. ""CBP issued a civil penalty to Ethiopian Airlines for the security breach and were briefed on measures the airline is undertaking to enhance the airline's aircraft security plan.""   CNN has obtained photos of the inside of the Boeing 777 aircraft as it looked during an inspection in the aftermath of the escape. In some pictures, it is possible to see the crew bunk in the center of the plane's seating area, which the two men reportedly entered before lifting a mattress to reveal a maintenance access panel.  A top view of their hiding place in the ceiling of the plane.The maintenance access panel that the two men enlarged in order to crawl through.The images indicate they then cut a larger hole in the panel to enable them to smuggle themselves through the gap into the plane's ceiling. They hid in this spot, not far above the aircraft's toilets, for over a day and a half. CNN showed Boeing the photographs and a Boeing representative deferred to Ethiopian Airlines for comment.   The source at the airline told CNN they believed the fact that the stowaways were former maintenance technicians for the airline enabled them to know exactly where to hide inside the plane to go undetected without damaging the structure of the aircraft.    That they had the necessary tools with them to cut through the panelling might suggest the pair had planned the attempt in advance, the source at the airline added.   In total, 16 Ethiopian Airlines technicians appeared to have escaped via any possible means, either by boarding as cabin crew and walking off or stowing away, he said. CNN has been unable to independently verify this number.  For Yohannes and Gebremeskel, the decision to flee was an impromptu one, they said. They picked the first scheduled flight to a European country that was available and had to leave possessions including their cell phones behind in their lockers.   For the whole of their seven-hour flight to Brussels, they sat in the cargo area of the Airbus A350 with no food, no water, in the freezing cold, unbeknownst to the other members of the crew on board.     ""I didn't even have any clothes with me, I was wearing the uniform for maintenance [...] I'm still wearing it,"" Yohannes said.     ""We don't have anything to change into here, no underwear, no shoes, even the shoes [...] we tried to cover our feet and the legs with what we had, it was night shift, on night shift we have the jacket of Ethiopian Airlines crew,"" Gebremeskel, who also obtained asylum in Belgium, told CNN.  It was not how Gebremeskel imagined he would experience his first trip out of Ethiopia. Despite working for five years at Ethiopian Airlines, he had never boarded an international flight.    Airline employees claim discrimination against Tigrayans Many people have left Ethiopia by land since the conflict began in November 2020. As of mid-December 2021, more than 50,000 people had fled into neighboring Sudan, according to UN figures. At the peak of the influx, ""more than 1,000 people on average were arriving each day, overwhelming the capacity to provide aid,"" a UN report said.     A refugee camp in Um Rakuba, Sudan, pictured in August. More than 50,000 Ethiopians have fled to Sudan since the Tigray conflict began in late 2020, according to the UN.Meanwhile, attempts to leave Ethiopia by air by legal means have become increasingly difficult for Tigrayans, according to Ethiopian Airlines employees CNN spoke with.   Several attempted to leave by boarding planes from Addis Ababa's Bole Airport as legitimate passengers but were denied access due to their Tigrayan ethnicity, they claimed. One former employee told CNN there were four checkpoints at the airport where passengers had their passports checked before departure.    ""They check place of birth and name,"" they told CNN, recalling three of their own failed attempts to leave. If the person was born in Tigray or had a Tigrayan name they were denied exit from Ethiopia, the former employee said.     As a result, several employees told CNN they escaped by working on board international flights as flight crew and fleeing when the aircraft landed abroad, often when the destination was in Europe or the US.    CNN has obtained IDs that confirm the identities of all four men who stowed away. Flight paths of the two flights -- the one to Brussels and the one from Addis to Dulles airport through Dublin -- have also been crosschecked on FlightRadar24.   Ethiopian Airlines has not responded to CNN's request for comment regarding the stowaways' journeys or the allegations of discrimination against Tigrayans. This is not the first time Ethiopian Airlines has made headlines during the conflict in Ethiopia. In October last year CNN revealed that the airline had been ferrying weapons between Ethiopia and Eritrea at the outset of the conflict in November 2020, an act that was condemned by the international community as a potential violation of aviation law.  CNN's investigation triggered calls by US lawmakers for sanctions and investigations into Ethiopia's eligibility for a lucrative US trade program. Ethiopia was kicked out of the program over human rights violations at the start of 2022.   The airline has issued multiple denials about transporting weapons.      'We were shaking'   After the aircraft carrying Yohannes and Gebremeskel landed in Brussels, the two waited for their chance to reach the terminal building.     ""There were two guys working on the aircraft. One was unloading the cargo shipment and the other was coming with a torch around the plane,"" Yohannes said. ""So when the first was unloading the flowers we jumped to the ground -- me and my friend -- we jumped, and we ran to the terminal.""     Inside, employees gave them water and something to eat, but Yohannes and Gebremeskel were still in shock. ""We were afraid they were going to send us back [...] The guards, they brought us tea, but we were kneeling down on the ground, we were shaking,"" Yohannes added.    Slowly, they felt a sense of relief, perhaps for the first time since they took off from Addis Ababa.  Their decision to flee had been prompted in part by reports that 38 Tigrayan security guards had been recently suspended at Bole Airport, meaning security was more lax than usual, they said.  

""We were afraid of course ... Luckily, we were not found. If we had been found, the punishment would have been harsh.""
Gebremeskel
But NISS, Ethiopia's national intelligence security service, was still searching every part of the aircraft before departure, Gebremeskel explained, in order to prevent escapes. The Ethiopian Prime Minister's spokesperson, Billene Seyoum, did not comment on these allegations. Ethiopian Airlines has not responded to CNN's request for comment on the security situation at Bole Airport""We had some tools with us, we were afraid they were going to catch us because they check -- the guy from the national intelligence security service checks every flight before departure,"" Gebremeskel said.     ""We were afraid of course. We were sitting with some tools with us. Maybe they will come to check that we're working on it. Luckily, we were not found. If we had been found, the punishment would have been harsh.""    Yohannes hopes that in Belgium, he will find a country that will ""respect my demands, the right to life.""   Pieter-Jan De Block, their lawyer, confirmed in a statement to CNN that both his clients had ""obtained international protection in Belgium"" and that they'd been released from the center where they were staying.   For Gebremeskel, the picture is bittersweet. With his family still far away -- his parents are in a refugee camp in Sudan -- and no money or job in Belgium, life is not easy. Although he has accommodation now, his first two nights after being granted asylum were spent sleeping at a train station.   He told CNN he hoped one day to return to Ethiopia but that until the country is a place where ""people aren't treated differently for their ethnicity,"" that hope feels very remote.   "

africa,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/africa/africa-coups-resurgence-intl-cmd/index.html,Why are coups making a comeback in Africa? ,"Analysis by Remi Adekoya, for CNN  ","Remi Adekoya is a political analyst and Associate Lecturer at York University. (CNN)In just over a year, Africa has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one more recently in Guinea), one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, and an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president. These power grabs threaten a reversal of the democratization process Africa has undergone in the past two decades and a return to the era of coups as the norm. According to one study, sub-Saharan Africa experienced 80 successful coups and 108 failed coup attempts between 1956 and 2001, an average of four a year. This figure halved in the period from then till 2019 as most African nations turned to democracy, only for it to once again be on the ascendance. Why?Different decade, same problemsIn the early postcolonial decades when coups were rampant, Africa's coup leaders virtually always offered the same reasons for toppling governments: corruption, mismanagement, poverty. Read MoreThe leader of Guinea's recent coup, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, echoed these justifications, citing ""poverty and endemic corruption"" as reasons for overthrowing 83 year old president Alpha Conde. The soldiers who led a coup in neighbouring Mali last year claimed ""theft"" and ""bad governance"" prompted their actions. Likewise, the Sudanese and Zimbabwean generals who toppled Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and Robert Mugabe in 2017 respectively, deployed similar arguments.  Guinean military officer says President Alpha Conde arrested, as apparent coup unfoldsWhile well-worn, these justifications still resonate with many Africans today for the simple reason they continue to accurately depict the reality of their countries. Furthermore, in many countries, people feel these problems are worsening. The research network Afrobarometer conducted surveys  across 19 African countries which showed 6 in 10 respondents saying corruption is increasing in their country (the figure was 63% in Guinea) while 2 in 3 say their governments are doing a poor job fighting it. Furthermore, 72% believe ordinary citizens ""risk retaliation or other negative consequences"" if they report corruption to authorities, a sign Africans believe their public institutions are not just partakers in, but active defenders of, corrupt systems. When it comes to poverty, an already tragic situation has been worsened by the battering Africa's fragile economies took from the coronavirus pandemic.  One in three people are now unemployed in Nigeria, West Africa's largest economy. The same goes for South Africa, the most industrialized African nation. It is now estimated the number of extremely poor people in sub-Saharan Africa has crossed the 500 million mark, half the population. This in the youngest continent in the world with a median age of 20 and a faster-growing population than anywhere else, further intensifying an already fierce competition for resources.  These conditions create fertile conditions for coups and for increasingly desperate young Africans who have lost patience with their corrupt leaders to welcome coupists promising radical change, as was witnessed on the streets of Guinea following the takeover, with some elated Guineans even kissing the soldiers.  But as with the coups of the 1970s these scenes of joy will likely be shortlived, says Joseph Sany, Vice President of the Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace. ""The initial reaction of what you see on the streets will be of joy, but very soon, people will be demanding action...  and I'm not sure the military will be able to deliver on the expectations, basic service delivery, more freedoms,"" he says.Threat to democratic gains  What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades. Worryingly, research shows that many Africans are increasingly ceasing to believe elections can deliver the leaders they want.  Surveys conducted across 19 African countries in 2019/20 showed just 4 in 10 respondents (42%) now believe elections work well to ensure ""MPs reflect voters' views"" and to ""enable voters remove non-performing leaders.""  In other words, less than half believe elections guarantee representativeness and accountability, key ingredients of functional democracies. Across 11 countries polled regularly since 2008, the belief elections enable voters remove non-performing leaders has dropped by 11% points among citizens, according to the survey. It is not that Africans no longer want to choose their leaders via elections, it is simply that many now believe their political systems are gamed.  Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem. The only reason he was still in power until the coup was because he engineered constitutional changes in 2020 to enable himself serve a third-term as president, a common practise by several leaders on the continent, from Uganda's Yoweri Museveni to Alassane Ouattara in Côte d'Ivoire.  Mali's President resigns after he was arrested in a military coupThe African Union is rightly condemning Guinea's coup, but its response to such constitutional abuses has been muted. These double standards and perceived elite conspiracies create the perfect environment for young swashbuckling officers like the 41-year-old Doumbouya to step in and promise to save the day. ""If the people are crushed by their elites, it is up to the army to give the people their freedom,"" said Guinea's new leader, quoting the former Ghanaian president Jerry Rawlings who himself led two coupsIt is perhaps no coincidence Doumbouya quoted the feisty Rawlings, who was very effective at expressing the anger Ghanaians felt towards their political elites when he led military juntas in the 1980s. Desperate citizens living in political systems they often rightly believe are fixed can easily be seduced by anti-elite, anti-corruption rhetoric coupled with the promise of the new. We should, unfortunately, prepare ourselves for the eventuality of more coups in Africa in the coming years. They are not to be expected in richer countries with strong institutions such as South Africa, Ghana or Botswana but in the poorer more fragile states. As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred. Fifteen of the twenty countries topping the 2021 Fragile States Index are in Africa, including countries like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan as well as larger nations like Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia (which has been experiencing violent internal conflict for close to a year now) and Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.Men are marched out of prison camps. Then corpses float down the riverThis increasing probability of coups will make Africa in general less predictable and stable, a negative for investors that could end up worsening the economic situation. Can this undesirable trend be reversed? Yes, but while the international condemnations of coups in Guinea and elsewhere are crucial as deterrents to other would-be power grabbers, the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend are African leaders themselves. They are the ones in charge on the ground and it is their response to these recent events that will be the deciding factor. They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans. But if the problems still being cited to justify coups continue to worsen in today's African democracies, then the temptation to try something else will continue to be dangerously seductive, both for coupists and citizens alike.

How children were used in a 48-hour deadly rampage for goldBy Saskya Vandoorne, Adama Koné, Nick Paton Walsh, Dalal Mawad and Jo Shelley, CNNUpdated 1040 GMT (1840 HKT) December 22, 2021 (CNN)The men were shot as they slept outside, having spent their days underground, choking in the Sahel dust, digging and panning for gold. They were killed by children -- some apparently as young as 12 -- and men who had arrived on dozens of motorbikes and were egged on in their murderous spree by women who knew the village well, according to witnesses. The local militia had left. The army came to the rescue for a matter of hours in the morning but then left before dusk, letting the attackers return the following night to burn the village down and most likely steal what gold it had. In the end, somewhere between 170 and 200 people died, according to estimates by a local police source and other officials, and it still remains unclear who the killers were. The massacre in Solhan, northern Burkina Faso, took place over two nights of extraordinary brutality in June 2021. The killings soon faded from international headlines, absorbed into the rhythms of persistent violence in the Sahel region, an arid stretch of land sandwiched by the Sahara Desert and the African savannah, and wracked by the climate emergency. In the lawless and remote communities of the Sahel, jihadists increasingly hold sway. Yet one likely culprit in this incident, al Qaeda's local affiliate JNIM, condemned the attack's brutality. And the other main suspect, ISIS, chose to blame it on al Qaeda, according to an ISIS-affiliated newspaper. Read MoreDozens of interviews by CNN with survivors, local witnesses and Burkina Faso officials paint the most complete and disturbing narrative yet of a rampage perpetrated over 48 hours, partially by children, that the US-backed and trained Burkina Faso military was powerless to stop. Yet few officials or witnesses agree on a coherent and consistent motive for the attack. Were the child attackers sent for Solhan's gold, as currency for their Islamist masters? Was it a punishment killing ordered by jihadists against villagers loyal to the government? The story of Solhan is a notable mark in the patina of brutality spreading across the Sahel. The intervention -- and now ongoing drawdown -- of the French military, the arrival of European Union forces, and the Pentagon's sustained support mean billions have been spent in attempts to bolster the local security forces. Yet violence has spiraled instead, particularly in Burkina Faso over recent years. The crisis in some of sub-Saharan Africa's poorest states presents an imminent threat to Europe's security, and by extension the United States, analysts say, in providing a secure and spacious breeding ground for terror networks. US officials have described the ""wildfire of terrorism"" in the Sahel, with al Qaeda and ISIS ""on the march"" in West Africa, aiming to ""carve out a new caliphate.""Illicit gold has emerged as a key source of funding for jihadist groups, who have been seizing so-called ""informal mines"" -- small-scale mining sites which rely largely on physical labor and basic technology to extract precious metals and minerals -- in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger since 2016, according to a Crisis Group report from 2019. In this file photo taken in February 2020, miners work at a gold mine in Bouda, Burkina Faso. A growing number of small-scale gold miners are out of work in Burkina Faso as jihadists try to seize control of the country's most lucrative industry.Bachir Ismael Ouédraogo, Burkina Faso's minister of energy and mines, told CNN the country lost 20 tons of gold through informal mining and exports every year, worth roughly $1 billion on the open market. Ouédraogo describes it as a ""war economy,"" a system that uses well-coordinated routes across the African continent. ""The gold you end up buying is financing terrorism, and affecting our families here,"" he added.The first night: MassacreTrapped in the arid plains around 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of the capital Ouagadougou, Solhan's gold is the village's only asset, and its curse. Satellite images of the village show the damage that informal mining has done to the terracotta soil -- the charred grey tailings and spoil from the intense activity of men who spend so many hours digging underground that they must sleep outdoors to recover. A satelite view of the site of the attack on Solhan in Burkina Faso.A local government-backed militia called the VDP (a French acronym meaning Volunteers for the Defense of the Country) provides some security. Yet on the night of June 4, Solhan was left mostly defenseless.More than 100 jihadists, on dozens of tricycles and motorbikes, had been spotted 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Solhan that afternoon, according to Boureima Ly, the emir of the local region of Yagha. The army was warned of a possible attack, but it was unclear if it would target Solhan or nearby Sebba -- according to Aly Bokoum, an activist with the Sahel Regional Youth Council in Burkina Faso -- so the local unit chose to stay in Sebba, where it is based. The VDP in Solhan also contacted the army about the threat but were told to leave the village, according to Bokoum. There were women who came and instructed the children on who to kill.A police sourceCNN has made multiple attempts to contact Burkina Faso's army for comment.Gold appeared to set the attackers' priorities. Mines at Mousiga, a tiny settlement to Solhan's east, were hit first, according to a mining official and a miner who were present. Many of the survivors, witnesses and officials requested anonymity for their safety.""Their faces were hidden with scarves,"" the miner said of the assailants. ""There were many of them on bikes and they started shooting. I started running for my life -- for 30 kilometers, all night, to safety."" This miner said he did not see children among this group and two other officials denied the involvement of children at the Mousiga mines. The distant gunfire from Mousiga was misinterpreted by the Solhan miners, who ""thought it was the army coming"" on a routine patrol and so ""stayed next to their wells,"" said the mining official. The attackers then hit a VDP base on the road into the village, before moving on to their main target.On entering Solhan, the convoy of children, women and likely some men split. One group turned left towards the mines. Another drove calmly into the center of the village. A local shop in Solhan was completely destroyed in the attack. The first shots in Solhan, heard by witnesses at 2:08 a.m., were at the mines, the police source said. ""The gold-diggers were first ... ambushed ... killed at random,"" he said, while describing the typical night-time scene. ""Most of the [miners] sleep outside, on site. They can't sleep indoors, and they don't go home either. Usually only a few of them get into the well late at night, and most come out because of the heat.""One miner said some victims were shot dead as they slept outside and others were slaughtered as they worked, trapped underground. ""All [the attackers] found outside were people sleeping,"" he said. ""That's what made it possible for them to massacre them like that."" Another miner said: ""People started coming out of the pits and running ... running for our lives."" He added that others hid inside the 30-foot-deep wells.We saw the light from the bullets all over the place. It was only God who saved us, otherwise they were going to exterminate us all.A survivor of the attackThe mining official described how a large gun was positioned beneath a nearby tree for use in the attack. ""Many ran away, but when you run, you're going to be seen and they shoot,"" he said, adding that some miners survived by hiding in the pits until 8 a.m. ""The first person who went down to the site [the following day] called me, and said the bodies were lying like fish,"" the official said. Several witnesses and officials told CNN that the attackers had in-depth knowledge of Solhan's layout. ""These are people who take the time to study their target,"" confirmed the police source, who said witnesses mentioned distinctly hearing women's voices among the attackers. ""They indicated to 'go to into this guy's house, do this and that,' and told children to 'go here and there,' that they couldn't let one person leave,"" the source said.Local activist Abdou Hoeffi, from the human rights group Burkina Faso Movement for Human and People's Rights (MBDHP), said the women played a cheerleading role with the child assailants, with shouts of: ""You are a good shooter! You go!""One witness, who said his parents were killed in the attack, told CNN in Solhan: ""They came with women and little children holding guns. Francois, a shopkeeper, he was taken away, my friend. If it was a man, they killed him -- a boy, they kidnapped him. A little one like that,"" he said, gesturing the embrace of an infant in his arms, ""who was breastfeeding [was taken away]. His mother lost her mind.""The road leading into Solhan. The attackers arrived on motorbikes, according to eyewitnesses.One Solhan woman, her bright blue dress glistening as she sifted grains through a sieve, described surviving the night: ""They destroyed everything ... I fled into my house with my child on my back ... I couldn't sleep all night. We saw the light from the bullets all over the place ... It was only God who saved us, otherwise they were going to exterminate us all.""Another witness said he and his wife were in bed with their 5-day-old baby when they heard the gunfire. ""Three terrorists passed by my house, in front of me, talking. They did not stop. I could see the bullets raining down everywhere in the night."" The witness, a former security guard for the local cellphone antenna, said the attackers disabled the phone mast that night and removed its battery, cutting the village off from the outside world and a chance of help.The attackers left at dawn, and the same witness said that the villagers started to venture outside again by 5 a.m. ""I couldn't count the number of corpses that were on the side of the road,"" he recalled. ""Everywhere you go, there are bodies lying around.""The mine was also an apocalyptic scene. ""We found that everyone died at the well. I made up to eight trips with a motorcycle cab to carry corpses,"" said another survivor.""  The mining official added that ""everyone was loaded on and off the motorbikes like bags of grain.""The area around the mine at Solhan was left damaged.Then the army finally arrived. One miner told CNN the attackers depended on the military's slow reaction when launching their assault. ""This is Burkina Faso. There is no fast response,"" the miner said. ""If they knew that in 30 or 40 minutes the army would come, they wouldn't [attack]. But they took all their time."" When the military did arrive, there was little to do but bury the dead, he said. ""They dug a big hole. There was no other solution."" The ex-phone antenna guard said the security forces asked villagers ""to go back home and lock the door, and to not hide any terrorists.""Six bodies were found at this location after the attack on Solhan in June 2021.Two officials said the militants' convoy did not really leave at first light but instead relocated to a hideout in the brush, and waited. The mining official specified a remote border area where he believed they had hidden. The police source said it was not clear if they met leaders there for further instructions, or just waited for the cover of night.Some of the villagers who remained in Solhan tried to flee, said the police source. ""They didn't know if it was over or not,"" he said. The hospital in the nearest city, Dori, was ""overwhelmed,"" he said. But it was unclear if the attackers were finished with Solhan. At dusk, the answer came.The second night: Destruction""I heard the sound of their motorcycles and said, 'Ah, they are [here] again,'"" one witness said. ""I went back to my yard, turned off the lights in my house, took my mat, took my blanket."" He said he left for another village -- traveling on foot with a group of Solhan's children, elderly residents and pregnant women. But the convoy's focus was different this time: They wanted to eradicate or loot all that remained. ""They started to burn. They entered the houses,"" said one survivor. ""At the stores, they took clothes, drinks, money, put them in their vehicles.""""They came back, they found four motorcycles at our place,"" another survivor said. ""They burned everything. They burned all our houses, until even the sheet metal was gone. They took rice, sugar, oil and boxes of other things.""Showing a cameraman around what remained of his home, the survivor gestured to the devastation -- the walls black with soot, apart from a patch where the TV was fixed before it too was looted. ""The grenade went through the wall and went to the other side,"" he said, pointing at a missing patch of plaster. ""The whole roof is gone.""The mining official said 80 sheep were also slaughtered in the violence. Young men who survived the onslaught sought medication for the psychological trauma in nearby Dori, he added. ""They were given pills or injections, because they say they couldn't close their eyes, because they could still see the dead bodies.""Video filmed in July shows the charred village clinic -- the hospital beds and consultation room beyond use. Shops and homes were incinerated, and rows of buildings left collapsed or with only their metal gates remaining. Motorcycles were torched. Even the mining machinery used to break rocks was half-smashed, yet in the video some of it still hummed around the mines that remained functioning.   Shell casings still lay on the ground. The scale of destruction -- fueled, it seemed, by something more nihilistic than just looting -- surprised some officials. Shell casings were found at the site of the attack in Solhan.Since June, officials, experts and survivors have been seeking to understand more about the massacre. The government, facing protests in Dori over its inaction and security failings, blamed jihadists. Government spokesperson Ousseni Tamboura told Radio France Internationale that two suspects had been detained before the attack and the arrests had led officials to link it to a little-known group called Mujahed al Qaeda, which is connected to the al Qaeda affiliate JNIM. Tamboura said gold was also a motivating factor. In the immediate aftermath, the government fired some security personnel and declared three days of national mourning.Tamboura told CNN in November the government believes al Qaeda affiliate JNIM was behind the massacre. He put the death toll at 132, which includes attackers killed in the incident, and fatalities from a neighboring attack. Tamboura declined to comment on the army's absence in Solhan that night, and said that the Burkina Faso military followed all protocols set between them and the US as a condition for aid. The spokesman added that the jihadi groups were fueled by hunger to control resources, not by ideology.A French military intelligence official, who didn't want to be named discussing sensitive information, agreed that jihadists were likely responsible, saying the massacre was likely committed by a group ""in the process of being formed,"" linked to JNIM. The official said attacks against the general population, as indiscriminate as those on Solhan, were more the hallmark of ISIS, however.Display of violenceBeds inside the local health clinic were burnt. The display of violence has once again highlighted the rapid deterioration of social structures and security in the Sahel region. A US intelligence official said: ""There is absolutely a continued need for Western involvement and engagement to address the expansion of the al Qaeda- and ISIS-based groups in the area and not give them complete freedom of movement -- as well as to build [the] capability [and] capacity of African partners.""The US official added that the crisis seemed to be fueled by local partnerships between jihadists and not an influx of ISIS fighters from the collapse of the former ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They said that they have not noticed a broad trend of ISIS fighters moving from the Middle East to the Sahel area, with the exception of one or two persons of interest. The official said the main concern was how ISIS affiliates across Africa were able to share tactics and build each other's capabilities. ""Whether it's physical facilitation capabilities from a group like ISIS Somalia with more skilled fighters [or] better media coordination from other groups, and being able to rapidly disseminate those capabilities more widely ... it is hugely concerning,"" they explained. ""You could take a group that is probably not very effective and make them very effective quickly, if they're able to leverage some of that skill set.""In Burkina Faso and its Sahel neighbors Mali and Niger, armed Islamist groups have killed more than 800 civilians in attacks during 2021 alone, according to Human Rights Watch.  Three days of mourning was declared in Burkina Faso after an August attack in the village of Gorgadji, about 50 kilometers west of Dori, where militants killed 80 people, reported Agence France-Presse. Fourteen soldiers were reportedly ambushed and killed in October near Yirgou, also in the north, the site of a similar attack that killed 15 police in June, according to Reuters. Gunmen killed dozens of people in another massacre in Yirgou in 2019, according to Amnesty International.People protest on June 22, 2019 in front of the Ouagadougou courthouse to demand ""truth and justice"" for the victims of a terrorist attack in Yirgou that left 49 dead.This rise in violence has occurred despite the US's enduring, low-profile military mission in Burkina Faso, which pumped in tens of millions of dollars in aid during 2018-19.Dozens of advisers are reported to mentor elements of the country's military, while a US embassy factsheet said the US has trained and equipped 3,000 soldiers and gendarmes. Yet significant swathes of Burkina Faso's volatile north remain outside of the government's control. Long-running accusations of abuses by the military have also complicated its relationship with its key military backers, specifically France and the US.Human rights organizations also face difficulties in Burkina Faso. The government suspended the operations of the Norwegian Refugee Council in September after the humanitarian group noted the country's speed at registering displaced people.  For the police source, however, the massacre at Solhan was particularly methodical and unparalleled in its brutality. ""These are people who take the time to study their target,"" he said. ""It is painful to see a woman instructing a child to kill such and such. Painful.""And for the survivors, the initial absence of the army, as well as its departure as night fell, are indications of the dark place they live in. ""If the [army] are not with the people, how is that possible?,"" one survivor said. ""As soon as the army left, [the attackers] came again. This is a strange country. It's a strange country."""
africa,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/british-vogue-february-cover-african-models-lgs-intl/index.html,Is British Vogue's latest cover the best way to celebrate Black beauty? ,,"Written by Stephanie Busari, CNNLagos, NigeriaStephanie Busari is CNN's Supervising Editor for Africa based in Lagos, Nigeria. All opinions expressed in the article below are the author's own. ""Sis have you seen this wonderful cover ... it's amazing,"" a friend wrote to me in an Instagram message.  It was the British Vogue February 2022 cover, which features an all-star team of African supermodels. It is one of two cover photos released this month (a second cover image features one of the group, supermodel Adut Akech, posing alone) and, according to British Vogue's British Ghanaian editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, the images aim to spotlight the rise of the African models  shaping the industry. However, my heart sank when I saw the picture of the models. I wanted to love it, but the image left me confused and raised questions about the execution of this important cover.Why are the models depicted in a dark and ominous tableau, the lighting so obscure to the point they are almost indistinguishable on a cover meant to celebrate their individuality? Why were they dressed all in black, giving a funereal air, and an almost ghoulish, otherworldly appearance? Why were they sporting strangely-coiffed wigs? Many of these women wear their natural hair normally and it would have been great to see that reflected on a cover celebrating African beauty. Additionally, on the cover, the models' skin color appeared to be several shades darker than their normal skin tone. 'Skin is a terrain': Nigerian-American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola on drawing intricate portraits of black lifeThe photographs were taken by Afro-Brazilian photographer Rafael Pavarotti, and the images -- published in numerous glossy magazines over the years -- are consistent with his visual style of presenting Black skin in an ultra-dark manner. ""This is a celebration of women, of matriarchy, and of the beauty of Black women,"" Pavarotti said of his first British Vogue cover shoot in an article accompanying the pictures online. ""They are the past, the present, and the future,"" he added. But the lighting, styling, and makeup, which purposefully exaggerated the models' already dark skin tones, reduced their distinguishing features and presented a homogenized look. Was this the best way to celebrate Black beauty? Would it not have been better to let their natural, unique beauty shine through?Pavarotti did not respond to requests for comment and Enninful declined CNN's request for an interview, while British Vogue has not responded publicly to the criticisms. A behind-the-scenes video of the shoot  was released along with the cover images. Shot with more natural light, before the women are fully styled, the short clip reveals more individuality, and a variety of dark skin tones, in dramatic contrast to the final result. Vogue's Anna Wintour pays tribute to André Leon Talley, calling his loss 'immeasurable'In an article published on the Vogue website, Enninful describes the models (Adut Akech, Anok Yai, Majesty Amare, Amar Akway, Janet Jumbo, Maty Fall, Nyagua Ruea, Abény Nhial, and Akon Changkou) as ""a powerful cohort of reigning and emerging superstars who have not only come to rule catwalks and dominate campaigns but have shifted the lens through which fashion is seen the world over."" He added: ""No longer just one or two dark-skinned girls mingled backstage, but a host of top models took a meaningful, substantial and equal place among the most successful women working in fashion today. It means so much to me to see it.""Adut Akech on the cover of British Vogue  Credit: From Rafael Pavarotti/British Vogue 'We want us as us' A cover is the highest accolade a magazine can give to a subject, and, historically, Black women have rarely been bestowed this honor.Former British Vogue editor-in-chief Alexandra Shulman famously noted in a 2017 interview in the Guardian that unknown Black women on the cover sold fewer copies.So, when Black women appear on the cover of global high-profile magazines like Vogue, these images circulate widely; we feel seen, celebrated, and acknowledged. That is why for many Black women, particularly dark-skinned ones like me, this Vogue cover feels personal. Kwame Brathwaite's powerful photos of the 'Black is Beautiful' movementWhen the February issue was first unveiled last week, I saw many people, like my friend, saying how stunning and beautiful it was.  So, I took to Twitter to see if others were as conflicted as I was. Hundreds of people replied to my tweet saying they found the images to be a poor representation of Black women.What I found is that many of us want to love these images, but can't shake off a feeling of disquiet that is rooted in deeper issues around beauty standards that have excluded us for so long.British Vogue under fire over February cover Many online critics felt the images were fetishized and pandering to a White gaze, ironic, considering the editorial team behind them consisted almost entirely of people of African descent. Ghanaian writer  Natasha Akua wrote in a private message on Instagram: ""When I saw it I immediately was shocked ... I feel like I know what statement he was trying to make visually but turning these black models into this strange tableau straight out of a horror movie just felt instinctively wrong.""""Why darken their skin beyond recognition?"" she asked. ""To make some statement about being unapologetically black? Unapologetically black means being who you are and does not require this manner of hyperbole."" ""I find the lighting and tones beautiful,"" Daniel Emuna wrote. ""But my personal complaint is that publications and brands are constantly communicating that the deepest darkest hue in complexion represents the truest essence of Blackness or even Africanness. This is clearly a mark of the white gaze."" While South Sudanese stand-up comic and social commentator Akau Jambo wrote: ""This is not art, this is Black Skin Porn. Black Fetish. Reverse Bleaching.""""This image is pure manipulation,"" he told me during phone conversation. ""This is what they do to South Sudanese models to tell a story about Africa and people are saying we don't understand the artist's perspective but you can tell a story and be projecting a false narrative.""""We don't want you to make us the Black you want. We want us as us."" It is undeniable that Enninful and his team have made excellent strides in championing diversity since he replaced Shulman as editor-in-chief of British Vogue. His first cover was the mixed-race model Adwoa Aboah and he has also featured Dame Judi Dench, who at 85 was the magazine's oldest cover star. He dedicated the September 2020 issue cover to 20 activists, including Manchester United footballer and free school meals advocate Marcus Rashford, photographed by Misan Harriman -- the first Black man to shoot a British Vogue cover. Many of the people who contacted me didn't want to criticize the February cover because of this work Enninful has done at Vogue, but we must not be afraid to hold even our African brothers and sisters accountable when it is needed. Change doesn't happen overnight and open conversation and debate are essential as we make strides to achieve the representation that we all want to see. "

africa,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/sport/joel-embiid-cameroon-afcon-football-76ers-spt-intl/index.html,'We've got a chance to win it all!': NBA superstar Joel Embiid discusses his love of Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations,"By Glen Levy and Amanda Davies, CNN"," (CNN)At approximately 11am on Saturday, January 29th, in the Philadelphia area of the United States, a 27-year-old man is intending to ease his seven-foot frame into a chair -- or perhaps remain standing -- and turn on the device of his choosing, to spend 90 minutes consumed by the events unfolding on a soccer field in his birthplace of Yaoundé, Cameroon.Warning: People in the vicinity may hear cheering -- loud, loud cheering. The fact that said sounds could be emanating from one of the best basketball players on the planet merely adds to the intrigue.When he's not playing Most Valuable Player-caliber ball for the Philadelphia 76ers -- and his definition of ""a bad night"" was a near triple-double of 26 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists in a 105-87 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday -- five-time NBA All-Star Joel Embiid is rooting for his nation of Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which his homeland happens to be hosting. Saturday's quarterfinal pits the Indomitable Lions against The Gambia in a match Embiid's team is expected to win. Victory would mean Cameroon is two games away from lifting a sixth AFCON title, with the most recent coming in 2017, the center's rookie year for the 76ers.Embiid was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month just three days before Cameroon defeated Egypt 2-1 in the 2017 final; a match-up which, if all things fall into place, could happen again on Sunday, February 6th.Read More""The excitement level has always been huge,"" Embiid tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies about his love of the Cameroon national team dating back to childhood. ""The crazy thing is that when Cameroon would always play, anytime they would score, everybody would just scream. You could hear the whole country just scream.""Joel Embiid is playing at an MVP level this season.The love of the LionsWhile his remarkable journey brought Embiid to America at the age of 16 -- first via high school and college in Florida and Kansas, and subsequently selected 3rd overall in the 2014 NBA Draft by Philadelphia -- he was born a few years after Cameroon's fairytale run to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy.The first African nation to advance to the last eight, a mere seven minutes away from reaching the final four, Cameroon eventually succumbed to England in extra-time. Along the way, the Indomitable Lions wowed the world, starting with the upset of reigning champion Argentina in the opening match. ""Obviously, Roger Milla kind of put us on the map,"" recalls Embiid about the then 38-year-old striker Milla scoring four times at Italia '90, gaining further fame for his trademark goal celebration of dancing by the corner flag.""Going back through history and watching the games, and learning through the history before I was born, and obviously the celebration was a huge part of that history ... we have a lot of history coming from Cameroon, and any time I get the chance to kind of be part of it, I always enjoy.""READ: Iranian women allowed to watch landmark moment as Iran qualifies for World CupEmbiid has watched all of Cameroon's matches at AFCON.Embiid believes that the class of 2022 can reign supreme at Africa's showpiece tournament. ""We're playing at home so any time you've got the support from your home fans that usually adds a lot to your motivation to go on and win every single game,"" he observes.""Playing at home is a huge advantage for us, and I think we've got a chance to win it all ... I'm excited to keep watching and keep supporting.""Cameroon's success at AFCON notwithstanding, the fortunes of a football team pale in comparison to the deaths which occurred at the Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé last Monday due to a stadium crush. At least eight people were killed and 38 injured during the Round of 16 game between Cameroon and Comoros.A somber Embiid says: ""I'm a man of God, so I pray for those families to find peace and also for their loved ones to find peace and be at peace. It is tragic that it happened and I'm extremely sorry for it."" Given the horrific events, what would it mean to Embiid and Cameroon if the team does go on to lift the trophy?""As a country, we've been through a lot,"" he reveals. ""We haven't had any competition [held] over there for a long time, so to be able to finally get it and to be able to win, I think is going to be huge for us.""Embiid tells CNN he's set his sights on winning the MVP award this season.AFCON getting more creditIn the build up to AFCON 2022, there was discussion in some quarters that stars such as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (Egypt) and Sadio Mané (Senegal), Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez (Algeria), Paris Saint-Germain's Achraf Hakimi (Morocco) and Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal) temporarily leaving their club sides behind was such a bitter pill for their club sides and supporters to swallow, it overshadowed the prestige which comes from representing one's country, to say nothing of elevating the tournament to the levels attained across other continents. Embiid follows European football closely, so does he concur that AFCON fails to get the credit it deserves on the global stage?Substitute keeper Abo Gabal the shootout hero as Egypt advance""It's messed up,"" Embiid quickly concludes. ""When it always comes to Africa, I feel like there's always kind of double standards. I never hear any complaints when it comes to the European Cup or any other cups.""[AFCON]'s a little different because obviously it's going on during the season over there, and some of the best players, when you talk about someone like Mo Salah or Sadio [Mané] they're supposed to be playing for their clubs. But I also appreciate them wanting to just go back and represent their country, which is good.""I think we're still earning our respect ... when you look at the success that Africa has in general, we have a lot of talent. Not just in football but in basketball or other sports too. Over time, we're going to overcome that but it's getting there slowly.""As for the big man himself, when asked what would mean more to him -- Cameroon triumphing at AFCON or Embiid winning MVP -- he smiles. ""That's tough! I want both -- both would be great!""It would have been a better question if you were to ask me between Cameroon winning or me winning a championship!"" Asked then which he would prefer, Embiid said, ""Both would be great, like I said, I'm a competitor -- I want to win.""Embiid will be tuning in to watch Cameroon's quarterfinal against The Gambia.After detailing the hard work Cameroon made of their previous opponents Comoros, as the continental minnows played much of the match with 10 men and the entire game with an outfield player in goal, Embiid gives a message to the team of his heart ahead of the challenges which await.""Go out there and keep doing whatever they've been doing. At the end, they've been doing great. They have our full support to continue to do so and I really hope that they're able to keep that cup in our home territory, so I'm gonna keep supporting them. Like I said, I'm going to be watching the rest of the games.""Will we see another iconic celebration like Embiid's Twitter video of Max Verstappen's maiden Formula One title if the Indomitable Lions pull off their sixth AFCON crown? ""I hope the excitement of when we get to the final is the same thing [as the F1 finale]. We might get one!"""

SingaporeThe multitude of dishes served in the hawker centers entice the appetite in this Asian city-state. These open-air food courts are always open for business, and it's not uncommon to see hungry people scooping up bowls of savory curry noodles first thing in the morning.For a traditional hawker-style breakfast, kaya toast is a must-have. This unassuming-looking toasted sandwich is spread with flavorful kaya, a sweet jam made with coconut milk, eggs and sometimes pandan leaf for vibrant green color and flavor. It's great with coffee or tea, and each stall or shop makes kaya toast its own way -- so why not try a few?MoroccoAlong with mint tea, semolina breads are mainstays on the Moroccan breakfast table.

ArgentinaThere's one word that defines the Argentinean breakfast spread: facturas. The overarching term for pastries encompasses a sweet and doughy world of shapes, sizes and flavors.Some of the more popular offerings include medialunes, a croissant-shaped brioche pastry; bombas and bolas de fraille, or fried doughnuts; and churros, which are often dipped in chocolate. Many are filled with dulce de leche or crema pastelera, a vanilla custard.Pair a platter of facturas with highly caffeinated yerba mate or coffee.GermanyIn the land of many wurst, it's not surprising that sausage and other meats take a starring role in frühstück, the traditional German breakfast.This buffet spread is filled with variety: sausages, cold cuts, cheeses, bread and rolls (including pretzels), as well as fresh fruit, soft-boiled eggs and condiments such as homemade jam.

Sirene is a feta-style cheese that's creamier and softer than many of the Eastern European brined cheeses, so it doesn't give the dish as much of a salty flavor and more of a fresh, goat cheese-like tanginess.TurkeyKahvalti, the traditional Turkish breakfast spread, is a lavish affair that has a little something for everyone.

And while pancakes can be dressed up by adding in everything from fresh blueberries to chocolate chips to pecans, the classic toppings of butter and maple syrup remain the gold standard.RussiaThough it sounds indulgent, caviar is actually a Russian breakfast food. Whether red or black caviar, it remains a favorite topping for large, folded crepe-like blini or small, thick oladyi pancakes at weekend brunches. On weekdays, however, breakfasts are simpler. On these mornings, caviar is spread across dark, sweet rye bread, known simply as black bread, sometimes with a smear of butter as well.Most importantly, a pot of black tea is a fixture on every breakfast table.This story was first published in May 2019 and last updated and republished in January 2022.Casey Barber is a food writer, photographer, and illustrator; the author of the cookbooks ""Pierogi Love: New Takes on an Old-World Comfort Food"" and ""Classic Snacks Made from Scratch: 70 Homemade Versions of Your Favorite Brand-Name Treats""; and editor of the website Good.

africa,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/09/health/black-fetus-medical-illustration-diversity-wellness-cec/index.html,A viral image of a Black fetus is highlighting the need for diversity in medical illustrations,"By Harmeet Kaur, CNN"," (CNN)At first glance, the image looks like a standard drawing that could easily be found in the pages of a medical textbook or on the walls of a doctor's office.But what sets apart the illustration of a fetus in the womb that recently captured the attention of the internet is a simple, yet crucial, detail: its darker skin tone.The image, created by Nigerian medical student and illustrator Chidiebere Ibe, struck a chord with countless people on social media, many of whom said that they had never seen a Black fetus or a Black pregnant woman depicted before. It also brought attention to a larger issue at hand: A lack of diversity in medical illustrations.(While most fetuses are red in color -- newborns come out dark pink or red and only gradually develop the skin tone they will have for life -- the medical illustration is intended to represent patients who aren't used to seeing their skin tones in such images.)Ibe said in an interview with HuffPost UK that he didn't expect to receive such an overwhelming response -- his fetus illustration was one of many such images he's created as a medical illustrator, most of which depict Black skin tones. But it underscored the importance of a mission he's long been committed to.Read More""The whole purpose was to keep talking about what I'm passionate about -- equity in healthcare -- and also to show the beauty of Black people,"" he told the publication. ""We don't only need more representation like this -- we need more people willing to create representation like this.""CNN reached out to Ibe for comment, but he did not expand on the topic further.Ni-Ka Ford, diversity committee chair for the Association of Medical Illustrators, said that the organization was grateful for Ibe's illustration.""Along with the importance of representation of Black and Brown bodies in medical illustration, his illustration also serves to combat another major flaw in the medical system, that being the staggering disproportionate maternal mortality rate of Black women in this country,"" she wrote in an email to CNN.What medical illustration isMedical illustrations have been used for thousands of years to record and communicate procedures, pathologies and other facets of medical knowledge, from the ancient Egyptians to Leonardo da Vinci. Science and art are combined to translate complex information into visuals that can communicate concepts to students, practitioners and the public. These images are used not just in textbooks and scientific journals, but also films, presentations and other mediums.There are fewer than 2,000 trained medical illustrators in the world, according to the Association of Medical Illustrators. With only a handful of accredited medical illustration programs in North America, which tend to be expensive and admit few students, the field has historically been dominated by people who are White and male -- which, in turn, means the bodies depicted have usually been so, too.Black or 'Other'? Doctors may be relying on race to make decisions about your health""Historically [medical illustrations] have always featured white able bodied male figures and still do in the present day,"" Ford said. ""Bias towards one body type in medical illustration marginalizes everyone else.""Studies have backed up this lack of diversity. Researchers at the University of Wollogong in Australia found in a 2014 study that out of more than 6,000 images with an identifiable sex across 17 anatomy textbooks published between 2008 and 2013, just 36% of the depicted bodies were female. A vast majority were White. About 3% of the images analyzed showed disabled bodies, while just 2% featured elderly people.Why diversity in the field mattersDiversity in the field of medical illustrations (or lack thereof) matters because these images can have implications for medical trainees, practitioners and patients. ""Without equitable representation and the perpetual use of only white able bodied patients depicted in medical textbooks, medical professionals are limited in their ability to accurately diagnose and treat people who don't fit that mold,"" Ford said. ""Medical professionals can then tend to rely on racial stereotypes and generalizations because of this knowledge gap on how symptoms present differently on darker skin tones, leading to poorer care.""A study by the same University of Wollogong researchers published in 2018 found that gender-biased images from anatomy textbooks increased medical students' scores on implicit bias tests. Another study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery -- Global Open in 2019 found that White patients were overrepresented in the images of plastic surgery journals, which the authors suggested could potentially influence the care non-White patients received. Black adults report bias in health care at higher rates than White and Latino people, study finds""For decades, peer-reviewed academic publications have used photographs and images that inadequately portray the diversity in demographics of patients affected by particular diseases,"" the researchers wrote. ""This is particularly striking in the lack of diversity in medical illustration. These inequities in medical reporting can have lasting downstream effects on the accessibility and provision of healthcare.""Ford said that those who aren't often depicted in medical illustrations ""can feel left out and unacknowledged in a healthcare setting, leading to feelings of distrust and isolation when receiving care."" She also said that medical professionals might feel less empathy for groups who aren't represented -- people who are Black, brown, women, transgender or nonbinary -- which can lessen the quality of care they receive. Inequities in health care have been well-documented, with studies showing that Black patients are more likely to experience bias and be misdiagnosed for certain conditions. Research has also shown that a substantial share of White medical students and residents hold false notions about biological differences between Black and White people, which can lead to racial bias in the ways their pain is perceived and treated.Despite the persistent need for medical illustrations to depict the full scope of human diversity, the field is beginning to see changes, medical illustrator Hillary Wilson told CNN.Wilson, whose illustrations depict Black people in infographics about eczema, sun damage, alopecia and other conditions, said both patients and practitioners could benefit from seeing diversity represented in medical illustrations. And through her work, she's attempting to humanize people of color and other marginalized groups by doing just that. ""The reality is that there are so many different types of people that exist,"" she said. ""To me, a resource isn't complete if I didn't at least consider that and try my best to account for the fact that there are so many different types of people.""While Ibe's image of the Black fetus seemed to mark a departure from the norm, Wilson said she hopes that in the future, seeing Black skin tones in medical illustrations will become routine.""Eventually, I hope it can just become one of the things that's expected,"" she added."

Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu is a Rolex Awards Laureate. (CNN)In the bustling Ogere Market in Ogun State, Nigeria, the race is on to sell fresh produce early in the day. By noon, the sun is at its peak, and with temperatures soaring, food spoils fast. As the day wears on, food can sell at less than half of its original value, slashing profits for retailers and farmers. That's why Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu decided to take a fresh approach to food waste. He's the founder of ColdHubs, which provides solar-powered food storage units designed for markets and farms. The 39-year-old has won countless awards for the initiative and has just been announced as the joint winner of the $1.5 million AYuTe Africa Challenge, for promising young innovators who are using technology to reimagine food production on the continent.

More than 5,250 smallholder farmers, retailers, and wholesalers use its cold rooms and in 2020, the company stored 40,000 tons of food, reducing waste and increasing farmers' profits.  ""This is food meant for human consumption that we typically lose along the supply chain, either during harvesting, transportation, or distribution,"" says Ikegwuonu. ""The mission really is to reduce food spoilage due to lack of cold food storage at key points along the food supply chain."" Read MoreTackling a food waste crisisNigeria is ranked 100 out of 113 countries on the Global Food Security Index. Over 88 million people in the country face food insecurity and 12% are undernourished. The problem isn't a lack of food, though: it's an excess of waste. An alarming 40% of the food Nigeria produces every year is lost before it even reaches consumers. That's equal to 31% of its total land use, according to the World Bank, and accounts for 5% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. How floating islands can make urban waterways green and clean Ikegwuonu's ColdHubs are 10-foot-square cold storage units which keep produce fresh for up to 21 days. Conventional cold storage units of this size would be powered by diesel generators and require 20 to 30 liters of diesel every day, says Ikegwuonu -- but by using solar panels instead, he says that across all its units, the company prevents over 1 million kilograms of CO2 entering the atmosphere each year, while powering the units 24/7. According to the UN, food waste accounts for up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so finding solutions to reduce waste could be vital in the fight against climate change. Storing a crate of produce in the ColdHub costs around 25 cents per day, and has helped farmers and retailers double their monthly earnings, says Ikegwuonu: ""This has been achieved by selling produce that was previously thrown away, sold off at the right price."" ColdHubs are now available at farms and markets in 22 Nigerian states.Scaling upLooking to the future, Ikegwuonu says ColdHubs is also developing technology to freeze produce, for fishing communities in the Niger Delta. ""Most of the coastal communities don't have access to energy at all,"" he says, adding that these freezer storage units would also have the capacity to produce ice blocks. Ikegwuonu also wants to extend his social impact by creating gender parity and jobs in a country where around 35% of all employment is in agriculture, and 90% of rural livelihoods depend on it.""We have been able to create about 66 new jobs for women,"" he says. ""Many of these women have become empowered and change agents in their households and communities.""Ikegwuonu says his current focus is on expanding the business further in Nigeria -- but in the next decade, he has his sights set on other countries struggling with similar food waste problems. ""The big dream for us is to solve the problem of food spoilage in Nigeria, and expand our technology and service to other African countries that have these challenges,"" he says.

europe,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/14/europe/europe-covid-vaccines-opposition-populism-intl/index.html,Why Europe's fight against the pandemic is about to get much more dangerous ,"By Melissa Bell, Dalal Mawad and Richard Allen Greene, CNN","Paris (CNN)""Despite months of persuasion, despite intensive media campaigns, despite discussions in various media we have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated."" Those were the words of former Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg last month as he announced the first nationwide vaccine mandate in Europe. Now, Germany looks set to follow where Austria has led. Others have made vaccines mandatory for parts of the population and imposed restrictions that increasingly explicitly target the unvaccinated, as Europe battles the twin challenges of sharply rising Covid figures and plateauing vaccination rates. Nearly one year into the EU's vaccination campaign, and with around one in three Europeans still unvaccinated, it is not so much hesitancy that European governments are now facing as outright opposition, with the danger that as governments get tougher so too will popular anger towards them. The crucial question of trustRead MoreOnly 19% of Europeans include their government among their most trusted sources of reliable information on Covid-19 vaccines, according to a survey conducted in May 2021 by the European Barometer, a collection of cross-country public opinion surveys conducted regularly on behalf of the EU's institutions.Even before the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy in Europe was strongly correlated to a populist distrust of mainstream parties and governments. One study published in the European Journal of Public Health in 2019 found ""a highly significant positive association between the percentage of people in a country who voted for populist parties and the percentage who believe that vaccines are not important and not effective."" What the pandemic has provided is a Europe-wide real-time test of that correlation. Nearly two years in and with most countries having exhausted what means they had of encouraging people to get vaccinated, the map of those who remain unvaccinated shows that where there is distrust in government and traditional political parties -- as measured by the strength of populist movements -- many people have yet to get vaccinated.Essentially, people who trust institutions need no convincing in the face of a pandemic; people who don't are unlikely to be influenced at all. Bodies pile up outside hospital morgue as Romania struggles with fourth wave of CovidEastern Europe is where vaccination rates are the lowest. Bulgaria has the lowest rate of all, with just 26.6% of the total population vaccinated, according to government data. The country has also been going through a major political crisis with three parliamentary elections held this year. Difficulties with vaccine rollouts and in reaching more remote and elderly rural populations are also to blame in Eastern Europe, but in some of the countries where vaccine take-up has been lowest, populist parties are either in power or strong electorally. Further west, lower vaccination rates are also to be found in countries and regions with either popular or voluble populist or extremist movements, as in Germany, Austria and Northern Italy.In a paper published by the journal Psychological Medicine in October, Michele Roccato and Silvia Russo from the University of Turin argue that their study shows ""people with a populist orientation tend to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine, in line with previous research showing that vaccine refusal is often politicized, but that its politicization is not limited to the traditional left-right cleavage."" A new common enemySophie Tissier, who organizes protests against Covid-19 restrictions and vaccines in France, says that these protests have created a new political force that is radical but goes beyond party political lines. She says her group seeks to ""create a citizens' opposition which is beyond electoral considerations and much more like a watchdog that sits outside the world of politics to be able to tell it: 'Look here, you are no longer protecting our rights, you are no longer protecting our rights under the law.'"" Demonstrators march during a protest against coronavirus measures in Brussels, Belgium, on December 5, 2021.In August, more than 230,000 people took to the streets across the country in one day after France became one of the first European countries to announce the use of relatively strict vaccine passes.""It really set things alight because people realized that life as it was, was coming to an end,"" she said. ""People would no longer be free, or able to go out as they did.""Since then, protests have tapered off in France, partly because no mainstream party has been openly encouraging its supporters to join them. France's vaccine rates are among the highest in Europe, suggesting that even in countries where there is strong vaccine hesitancy -- as there was in France even before the pandemic -- far-right or populist parties' stance on the vaccine can have an impact. Elsewhere in Europe, such groups are clearly fanning the anti-vaccination flames. In Austria, several protests planned since the government announced its nationwide vaccine mandate last month have been planned by the far-right Freedom Party.The mandate is due to come into force in February 2022.Even as he announced the move, Schallenberg accused the Freedom Party of being responsible for the country's low vaccination rates and of having stirred up vaccine hesitancy. ""We have too many political forces in this country that are fighting against [vaccination] vehemently, massively and publicly. That is irresponsible,"" Schallenberg said, adding: ""Incited by these radical opponents of vaccination, by specious fake news, unfortunately too many of us have not been vaccinated. The consequence is overcrowded intensive care units and enormous human suffering.""The world has the tools to end the coronavirus pandemic. They're not being used properlyIn other European countries, populist parties have also jumped on the bandwagon. And the divide in opinion over pandemic measures is no longer about extreme left and extreme right, said French political scientist Jean-Yves Camus, but ""between the mainstream and the periphery."" ""It's much more about the extreme,"" Camus said. ""The most extreme fringe groups taking advantage of the pandemic to say: 'This virus is fake, there is no pandemic and you are being tricked by your governments. It's a worldwide conspiracy of your national governments. They are using the pandemic to infringe on your individual rights and using vaccination passes to have your personal data,' and so on."" In parts of Eastern Europe, but also in and around Germany -- from Northern Italy to the Netherlands and Austria -- parties which once focused on immigration or Europe have been tapping into the widespread anger of those opposed to vaccines and Covid-19 restrictions, shifting their attention to an issue far more likely to appeal to the apolitical and to cut across traditional party political lines. Their new enemy is far more federating: The Covid-19 measures and vaccination campaigns that they say threaten their freedom. A protester wearing a mask depicting syringes applauds in Geneva, Switzerland, on October 9, 2021, during a rally against coronavirus measures.Vaccine mandatesThe World Health Organization has cautioned against vaccine mandates, because of their potential impact on public confidence and public trust. Dr Hans Kluge, WHO's Europe Director, said they should be used as ""an absolute last resort, and only applicable when all other feasible options to improve vaccine uptake have been exhausted.""In a part of the world where the fight against the pandemic has already been hampered by vaccine hesitancy, such mandates could fuel more resistance. ""The worry is that anti-vaxxers could come to hold even more extreme positions,"" said Russo, of the University of Turin. ""That's one risk. But we should also consider that where vaccines become mandatory, there will need to be controls and that could further undermine institutional trust. ""In other words, forced vaccination might push people into vaccination centers but it will also drive some of them to the streets, confirming and further fueling their deeply held suspicion of ""the system."" The fight against the pandemic may one day come to an end, but the fight against populism in Europe could be just beginning."

europe,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/cell-phone-calls-airplanes/index.html,Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,,"(CNN) — Ah, holiday travel. Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States. But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law. Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in. ""No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,"" he says. ""These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.""Keeping cabins calmFlight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight.  As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline. Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.""We are strongly against voice calls on planes,"" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: ""NO CELL PHONES."" Related contentIs it OK to recline your seat? The great reclining debateFlight attendants' opposition is significant.  They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.""At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,"" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas. ""If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.""Passengers advocating for quietMost passengers don't want to listen to their fellow travelers talk on their cell phones. Shutterstock Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an ""annoying"" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate. Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.""I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,"" he says. ""It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.""Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.Related content17 best Christmas markets around the worldBusiness travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.""For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,"" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. ""In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.""One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.Is the technology safe?Newer planes are designed to not be affected by passengers' technology.  Shutterstock The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.The rise of smartphones changed everything. As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable. Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.Related contentHow to split a check: Evenly or itemize? Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.""There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller.  ""But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been."" ""The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,"" says Miller. ""There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.""Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.""Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,"" he says. ""When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.""Regulatory, practical obstaclesTexting is already permitted on some airlines. ShutterstockThough it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted. ""Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,"" he said.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance. Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, ""The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation."" The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.Who calls people anyway?What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.""When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,"" he says. ""On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.""Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition. This means you may not be able to join that upcoming work call from 35,000 feet over the Mississippi Delta. It also means your holiday travel adventures likely won't include having to listen to your seat neighbor shout to a loved one grandma's recipe for Christmas struffoli. Consider yourself lucky.

The story behind Taiwan's newest airline, STARLUX  ",,"(CNN) — Debuting its first flights in January 2020, Taiwanese start-up STARLUX Airlines could be the first new player in 30 years to upend the island's duopoly aviation market. And even before the carrier, dubbed Taiwan's first luxury boutique airline, set its first aircraft into the air, it's been creating a stir. Eleven minutes after opening ticket sales online on December 16, the Taipei-based carrier sold out all seats on its  first three flights -- Taipei-Macau, Taipei-Penang and Taipei-Danang. But both aviation watchers and the general public are abuzz for another reason: A succession drama involving STARLUX founder Chang Kuo-wei that's so juicy he's being referred to as the aviation industry's ""Prince Hamlet"" by local media.   Chang Kuo-wei founded STARLUX Airlines after being ousted from his family business, EVA Airways.courtesy Starlux AirlinesThis Shakepearean tale took root in 2016, when Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group and airline EVA Airways, passed away at the age of 88, sparking a battle over who would take over one of the island's biggest family-run conglomerates.  Chang, 49, who had been the chairman of EVA since 2013, revealed that his late father had named him the successor of parent company Evergreen in his will. A well-loved figure in the aviation industry, known for his outspokenness and expertise, the son had experience working for EVA Airways as both an aircraft technician and a pilot.

He was soon ousted from EVA as chairman at a board meeting called by fellow family members. A few months later, he announced that he was going to launch his own airline -- STARLUX Airlines. ""He doesn't think that he's 'Hamlet'""Local media have called it a Hamlet-like retaliation plan. The anticipation of the new airline's launch has grown as both EVA Airways and China Airlines, Taiwan's two main airlines, have been plagued by strikes and internal conflicts.China Airlines and its crew reached a deal after a week-long strike in February 2019 whereas EVA Airways experienced a 17-day strike in July, the longest in Taiwanese aviation history.

Indeed, STARLUX is the first Taiwanese airline to be equipped with A321neos -- all 10 of them will be delivered by the end of 2021.

The interior of the narrow body cabin, designed by BMW's Designworks studio, is fitted with sleek seats, leather headrests and inflight entertainment systems across all classes. Economy class seats will feature a 10.1-inch 720p screen while business class seats -- equipped with narrow-body seats that can recline into an 82-inch fully flat bed -- will offer a 15.6-inch 1080p inflight entertainment system. Free Wi-Fi with basic access (texting only for economy passengers) will be offered for both classes on all STARLUX flights -- also a first in Taiwan.Local touches abound as well.

Instead, its tickets will be reasonable but more expensive than its competitors. ""We consider flying as an enjoyable part of the journey,"" adds Nieh. ""We offer top-notch and exquisite services. It differentiates STARLUX from other companies in the market.""We position ourselves as a boutique airline, targeting the higher-end market.

europe,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/metro-cityring-copenhagen-denmark/index.html,Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,,"Copenhagen (CNN) — In Copenhagen, traffic is usually caused by the two-wheel variety of transportation: the bicycle. Ever since bicycles were imported into Denmark from France in 1869, they have become the main form of transportation in the Scandinavian city. In the 1920s, it wasn't unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro's new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around. While Copenhagen's Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility. In addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey. Related contentThese are predicted to be the safest countries in the world to visit in 2020 Greater accessibilityThe circular line has 17 new stops, nearly doubling the number of existing stations.DA MARIE ODGAARD/AFP via Getty ImagesCityring, a 15.5-kilometer (approximately 9.63 miles) circular line with 17 new stops — which nearly doubles the number of existing stations —  now connects outlying neighborhoods that radiate far from the city center. Residents won't need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen's hygge-inducing winters. The impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. ""First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,"" he said. ""But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center."" Courtesy The Copenhagen MetroPublic squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing. ""We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,"" said Olsen. Building the line was not without its challenges. Olsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people's daily lives. ""We had the machinery right outside people's windows for quite a substantial number of years,"" he said. Glass and light are key design elements, and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings.Reginaldo Sales/Metro CompanyTechnical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik's Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station. Controlling groundwater was also imperative during construction. ""A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,"" explained Olsen, ""If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they'll rot."" In addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system. Related contentWorld's most livable city for 2019, according to the Economist Intelligence UnitShiny, new railsThe new M3 line allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level.Reginaldo Sales/Metro CompanyThe line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.The system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).Unlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing. For today's iTouch culture, screens by ticket machines supply riders with route information and maps.Not just easy on the ride, Cityring's stations are easy on the eyes. Glass and light are key design elements and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. At the Frederiksberg Allé station, for example, the green interior color scheme is a segue to the outdoor park that greets riders when they reach street level. Cleanliness and efficiency are two tenets of the Metro system. Revenue generated from ticket sales is reinvested into maintenance, and quarterly surveys of passengers give Metro operators direction on what's working, what's not and where they need to direct funds. Related contentThe Copenhagen artificial ski slope atop a power plant is now openBike-friendly The Cityring doesn't want to compete with bikes, but instead integrate itself into existing transportation infrastructure. ""Metro actually supports the thoughts of the having bikes being either last mile or first mile mode of transportation, so you could use it in combination,"" said Olsen. Bikes are allowed on the Metro during non-rush hours, and cellars at every station provide storage for the two-wheeled vehicles when not in use. Screens at exit points announce nearby bus and train departures for easy connections.This shiny new rail line is conductor-less and runs automatically.Reginaldo Sales/Metro CompanyWhile these features have residents excited about the new system, Olsen believes ""the most important thing is that you don't have to look up time table,"" he said. ""You can just go through the station and there'll be a train right after."" To him, freedom from the shackles of a schedule exemplifies the ease of using the Metro.The new M3 line — and the expansion of the Metro in general — not only services the city internally, but allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Citing Hamburg, Germany, and Stockholm, Sweden as nearby rivals, Olsen hopes to attract both businesses and tourists to Copenhagen via opportunities presented by the Metro. With the opening of the M3 Cityring, ridership is expected to rise from 65 million to 122 million by 2020, and two extensions to the existing M4 line are due to open over the next five year.While projections are ambitious, Olsen's definition of success is more modest. ""The less people have to think about us, the better,"" he said. ""So if you can just rely on us and don't have to think much about using the Metro, because it's easy to use and you don't have to plan your journey, then I guess we're a success."" "

In fact, the hotel's designer Zoltán Varró admits he had ""likes"" in mind when conceptualizing the property.""Instagram has really changed the hotel industry,"" Varró tells CNN Travel.

""There's a lot of competition in Budapest. We had some difficulties with the engagement of people at first. ""But we've had lots of guests who come here because they saw the pictures on Instagram.""One of the many intriguing areas of the hotel is the Great Hall, which serves as a dining area, a bar, as well as a lobby.Varró decided to make it the building's main focus after seeing photographs displaying the significance of the room during the 1890s, when Hungarian Freemasons regularly congregated here.Freemasonry pastThe grand staircase is among the  elements preserved from the old building.Courtesy Mystery Hotel BudapestOne of the most influential and well-known secret societies, Freemasonry was founded in the UK, but quickly spread to Europe and the rest of the world. The secular movement models itself upon the fraternities of medieval stonemasons, who used secret words and symbols to recognize each others' legitimacy.After the former Republic of Councils in Hungary and later the Interior Minister of Hungary, Mihály Dömötör, banned the activities of Freemasons in 1920, the building went on to serve as a military hospital. It was also used by the Hungarian National Guard Association, before returning to Freemasonry use after World War II. But during the communism era it went on to house the Ministry of the Interior until the fall of the regime in 1989.Needless to say, the building changed considerably during its many different incarnations and its Freemasonry elements were concealed.""After communism, the room was destroyed,"" says Varró. ""The Freemason aspects were completely covered, as no one wanted to talk about this.""I didn't want it [the Great Hall] to be hidden away. This is the heart of the building.""Its vaulted ceiling, which has been completely restored, is decorated with beautiful motifs, while the walls are adorned with bright columns and light boxes.Although the entire hotel is filled with chandeliers, the largest hangs directly over a marble chess board floor area in the Great Hall.At the far end of the room, two iron spiral stairs lead up to the gallery, where a private dining area aimed at larger groups can be found.Lit up by candles, the grand staircase is one of various elements preserved from the original building, which dates back to 1896, along with the main doors.You can see elements of the facade of the old building and the new building alongside each other from the sixth floor.Varró has preserved various motifs used in Masonic symbolism around the buildings, along with sculptures of a sphinx, a square and compass.Even the paintings in the corridors are linked to Freemasonry, some are the work of Freemasons background, while others are by artists from countries with strong links to the secular movement.However, Berényi stresses the Mystery Hotel represents far more than just Freemasonry, noting the organization, which has been blighted by conspiracy theories, may hold negative connotations for some.""As much as we are proud of the history, we can't make everything about the Freemasons, as they represent different things to different people,"" she says.Related contentThe best luxury bars in BudapestUnique suitesSome of the suites feature headboards with a modernized version of Leonardo Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa.""

europe,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/fine-dining-budapest/index.html,How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with,,"(CNN) — While Budapest may be primarily known for its architecture, geothermal springs and communist heritage, the city's gastronomy scene has been gaining considerable travel attention in recent years.New and exciting fine dining spots are constantly opening up in the Hungarian capital, many headed up by prolific chefs keen to inject imagination and prestige into the Budapest dining experience.Two restaurants in the Hungarian capital were awarded new Michelin stars in the past 12 months alone, bringing the total of Michelin-awarded establishments in Budapest to six.Hungary only received its first Michelin star nine years ago, so this is a pretty remarkable turnaround.There's little doubt a culinary revolution is underway in the ""Pearl of the Danube,"" but what's brought about this burgeoning movement?Record numbers of tourists and a booming economy have definitely played a part.With Hungary's difficult past well documented, it's fair to say that fine dining hasn't necessarily been a high priority for locals haunted by Communist austerity.""Hungary was always a pretty poor country,"" explains Hungarian food critic Andras Jokuti. ""So the main goal of Hungarian cuisine was to stay alive. It was very important to have lots of proteins and carbs -- it was based around potato and meat."" Related content10 of the best restaurants in BudapestCulinary movement Miguel Vieira at Budapest restaurant Costes tells CNN Travel what makes great, creative cuisine. Shifting this perception has been a lengthy process, which continues today. However, the tide is definitely turning.Portuguese chef Miguel Rocha Vieira believes this is partly due to good quality produce becoming more readily available in the country during the past decade.""We'd have to buy butter from abroad [before] because there was no good quality butter here,"" he tells CNN.""Everything is completely different now.""Vieira heads up Costes, based in Raday Street, and was at the restaurant's helm when it became the first in the country to earn a Michelin star back in 2010.He produces modern takes on classic Hungarian dishes, serving up four to seven-course set menus with various wine pairings.Jokuti feels that Vieira injected life into the dining scene by merging both Hungarian and Portuguese influences into his dishes early on.""When Miguel arrived in Budapest, it was like the very beginning of the fine dining story in Hungary,"" he says.Vieira admits he knew little about Hungarian cuisine when he came to the country all those years ago and was often ""hammered by critics.""""My cooking has changed a lot,"" he adds. ""Now I can tell you proudly that my stamp is in the food.""""One of the biggest compliments we can have here is if somebody says, 'I felt this dinner had personality.""While Vieira tries to incorporate Hungarian traditions in his dishes, this isn't the ""ultimate goal"" and he certainly doesn't have Michelin stars in mind while in the kitchen.""I always say to the boys, 'We should cook for ourselves. We should do what we believe.' It's not about cooking for awards,"" he adds. ""It's not looking for stars or for recognition.""That's the cherry on top of the cake. But that's not why we work 14, 15 or 16 hours a day."" Related contentBest attractions in Budapest: What you can't missModern interpretationsChef Tamas Szell from Budapest restaurant Stand on his modern interpretations of traditional Hungarian dishes.Hungarian chef Tamas Szell has been credited with putting Hungarian food on the map back in 2016, when his modern interpretations of the country's traditional dishes won him the gold medal at the prestigious 'Bocuse D'or Europe' competition.Szell and co-chef Szabina Szulló head up the kitchen at Stand, which was awarded its first Michelin star this March, has a similar approach to cooking to Vieira.""Food is the best communication between a chef and the guests,"" Szell tells CNN.""Hopefully our dishes contain the sweet memories from childhood. When I cook a dish, it should be acceptable to both our grandmothers and a Michelin inspector. This is the most difficult [part] I think.""Stand opened in Budapest in 2018 following the success of market hall bistro Stand25, which Szell and Szulló also ran together. ""My inspirations definitely come from my childhood,"" he adds. ""My mother had a saying, 'we are poor but we are living well'.""Szell says his fisherman's soup, which contains carp, paprika, water and tiny ravioli type pasta known as deraya in Hungary, is the second most popular soup after goulash. ""When I was a child, my mother often made it this way,"" he explains.Szell's dishes appear to be having the desired impact. Stand, based on Székely Mihály street, has been a big hit since it launched. In fact, Jokuti describes it as the ""the perfect Hungarian restaurant,"" praising the inventive way Szell manages to tone down the richness of traditional Hungarian cuisine.""This, I think, is his biggest achievement. To somehow recreate the traditions into something modern,"" says Jokuti.Szell sources his dairy products from a tiny farm just outside Budapest, which supplies to a handful of fine dining restaurants in the city.Within 48 hours of the milk leaving the cow's udder, it's being served up back at Stand in the form of cottage cheese,""I think the ingredients are the most important thing,"" adds Szell. ""The good ingredients always try to find the chef and the chef always tries to find the best ingredients.""Find out why Budapest restaurant Babel is a unique feature of the city's culinary scene.  Situated in Budapest's downtown, Babel is one of the most recent restaurants in the city to be awarded a Michelin star.It's relatively small, with around a dozen tables, exposed brick walls and dim lighting, offering an intimate dining experience.Inspired by Hungarian traditions and the Romanian region of Transylvania, chef Istvan Veres presents five to 10 course tasting menus containing simple ingredients such as nettle or lichen.Veres says cooking is an ""obsession"" rather than a passion for him, describing how he'll often dream about a dish and then attempt to bring it to life the very next day.""In fine dining, you have to do something special, something unique,"" he says.""You put your soul on the plate.""""I'm never scared about new things."" According to Jokuti, it's this fearlessness that makes Veres such a trailblazing chef.""Istvan's taste is not that easy to follow,"" says Jokuti.

"" In its original form, it's a very, very simple dish.""Just a piece of bread with some fat. We put some bacon on it, some caviar and some lambskin."" Only time will tell whether Salt will gain a coveted Michelin star, but the restaurant does seem to be winning over may diners in the short time it's been around for.""I think he [Toth] shows that it's possible to create a very hedonistic, but still very modern meal from sometimes humble, but very Hungarian ingredients,"" says Jokuti.A restaurant like Salt would have seemed inconceivable in the Hungarian capital a few years ago.Its emergence is a clear indication of the adventurous direction the city's culinary scene is currently moving in.""It's really fascinating to witness these times in Hungarian cuisine,"" says Jokuti.""I'm traveling a lot, visiting the world's best restaurants. It's amazing to see that I can come home and eat at these fine restaurants.""It's not like, 'Okay, it's not so good, but it's at least it's Hungarian.'

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.(CNN) — From traditional souks, mosques and UNESCO World Heritage sites, to futuristic skyscrapers, Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, offers an eclectic mix of old and new. Among the most startling additions to the modern skyline are the Flame Towers, a trio of sky-high structures that resemble tongues of fire reaching high over the Caspian Sea. Designed by US architecture firm HOK, and with Tower 1 standing at 182 meters, they're the tallest buildings in Azerbaijan.And visitors can stay in them -- one building's residential, one is for office use, while the third, the 165-meter-tall Fairmont Baku, is a contemporary five-star hotel. Related contentThe mud volcano capital of the world Enter the flameThe towers can be seen from almost anywhere in the city, but night is when they truly come alive. Orange, red and pink LED lights dance across the towers like burning flames. For some in Baku, they're now a symbol of home.""You can see Flame Towers as you fly into the airport, lit up with multicolored lights and shining the way,"" fashion designer and media professional Nina Zandnia tells CNN Travel. ""They're the sign that lets everybody know they've reached Azerbaijan.""So what's it like to stay in one of the country's most familiar landmarks? It's certainly no ordinary hotel.The bold, sometimes bombastic statements begin with the dramatic exterior and keep going all the way inside.  The venue's seven-story lobby is dominated by an extravagant chandelier, using five kilometers of strands, decorated with 840 lights and more than 600,000 crystal beads, and weighing a whopping two metric tons. Taking pride of place below is a limited edition black and red Fazioli, one of the most expensive pianos in the world. The M Liminal, designed by NYT Line and Philippe Gendre, was purportedly accompanied Nigar Jamal and Eldar Gasimov in the performance that took Azerbaijan to victory in the 2011 edition of the annual Eurovision song contest. Guests shouldn't expect to hear it used in any casual jam sessions, it's now only played by top pianists on special occasions. Come evening, the Flame Towers put on a light show enjoyed across the city. Courtesy Fairmont BakuSea viewsThe tower is home to more than 300 rooms, suites and serviced apartments, that range in price from $170 to upwards of $5,000 a night. Even the most basic offer ceiling-to-floor windows and sumptuously large double beds. The décor is a contemporary luxury mix, with plush carpets and modern furniture. Spacious and comfortable, each room in the hotel either looks out over the city or across the bay into the sea. Crisp and glamorous as it is, it does have an edge of corporate blandness that falls short of the regal vibes felt, for example, in the nearby Four Seasons. A typical one-bedroom suite on the 17th floor offers views of the Caspian Sea and, if eligible, access to the Fairmont Gold lounge on the 19th floor, which comes with a private check-in area and concierge service. The super-fast elevator to the 17th opens onto a spectacular landing with views across the bay. Once inside the suite, there's a lobby area, are more jaw-dropping views, an office-slash-dining room, with wooden desk and a four-seater dining table. Then there's a generous, richly carpeted lounge with an oversized sofa and jazzy signature chair.  The separate bedroom has a huge king-sized bed. There's an enormous walk-in closet stacked with hangers, drawers and laundry essentials that leads into a large bathroom complete with bath and shower room. In both of the suite's two bathrooms, there are bespoke toiletries -- yes, your name is printed on the shampoo, moisturizer and conditioner bottle. It's a souvenir just asking to be taken home.

Yes, says, Zumrud Ismayilova, the hotel's PR and marketing manager. Names are not named, but  the list apparently includes leaders, royals and celebrities.  ""We have had many VIP guests stay at the hotel, but we would never disclose who they are,"" she tells CNN Travel. ""When our guests come to stay with us, they expect privacy and confidentiality and that is exactly what we give them.""Positioned at the very tip of the flame, the Royal Suite offers panoramic views of both city and sea. There are two bedrooms, both with en suite bathrooms, a lounge, private dining room, study, a guest bathroom, a kitchen and a grand hallway with chandelier -- 375 square meters (4,036 square feet) of living space in total.""The VIP or family will stay in the suite, but the rest of their party tends to take over the entire floor. We have additional rooms for security and staff, and a suite for extra family members,"" explains Ismayilova. There's an open-plan living area, private study, a dining room fit for for 12 or more guests and a fully equipped kitchen (for the servants, of course). But the main attraction is the grand en suite bathroom with a vast oyster-shaped bath complete with window view over the bay. WellnessThe hotels amenities are a mixed bag. There's an elegant spa spread over two floors of the hotel with indoor pool, sauna, hot tub, hammam and spaces to unwind. There's also a fully equipped gym. The beautifully designed Sky Garden allows guests the luxury of relaxing on the sundeck or taking advantage of the poolside sauna while looking out at the sea. There's an S-shaped rooftop pool and outdoor bar, which look better from a distance than close up. It's best visited come evening. When the sun's up, the towers reflect the sun and magnify its heat, making this area a frying pan.

There's also the Nur lounge which is a funky setting serving cocktails and snacks, and is a good pre-drinks site to soak in the atmosphere before moving onto the hotel's Jazz Club, a local institution.""We always recommend people to check out the Jazz Club after 9 p.m., because that's when it really gets going. It's very popular with both the hotel guests and the locals, and we always offer something new to keep people entertained,"" Ismayilova says.There are two things that most hotels are unable to provide -- a shopping mall and cinema. Fairmont Flame Towers offers both.Park Cinema provides guests (and members of the public) with six screens, including IMAX, showing the latest Arabic, English and Russian language films. Next door is the Flame Towers Shopping Mall, due for completion in early 2020. Luxury brands, high street names, cafes and restaurants are all set to take up residency.

europe,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/long-life-lerik-azerbaijan-wellness/index.html,Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air ,,"(CNN) — There are a number of destinations around the world famed for the longevity of their residents. In Japan, Okinawa's sprightly centenarians have earned it the nickname ""Land of the Immortals."" Campodimele, Italy's ""Village of Eternity,"" is testament to the Mediterranean diet. In the sunny Californian town of Loma Linda, a community of Seventh-Day Adventists reaping rewards of clean living. There's one long-lived corner of the globe you won't have heard talked about as much, and it's home to the world's only Museum of Longevity. That's Lerik in southern Azerbaijan. The South Caucasus country is home to several regions known for producing residents who live to triple-figure ages, including  Lankaran and Nagorno-Karabakh. But another, Lerik, is reputed to have the highest concentration of centenarians. In this emerald land high above the clouds in the Talysh Mountains, reached by loop after loop of a serpentine road, people seem to have discovered a secret to a long and healthy life. The Museum of LongevityThe two-room Museum of Longevity, built in 1991 and renovated in 2010, holds more than 2,000 exhibits documenting the lives and memories of the region's oldest inhabitants. It charts individual lifespans with the household items that they've outlived, such as three generations of clothing irons. There are chests filled with headscarves and shirts, silver pitchers and bowls, beautifully knitted socks, and hand-dyed rugs that are still brightly colored despite their age. And then there are the letters, written in both Azerbaijani and Russian -- personal artifacts so old that the ink is starting is fade. Perhaps the most captivating features are the portraits of centenarians that cover the museum's walls. These images, dating from the 1930s, were donated by French photographer Frederic Lachop. The museum, and official Azerbaijan statistics, define ""centenarian"" more loosely than you'd expect: Here, it means anyone over 90 years old. However, back in 1991, there were more than 200 people in Lerik registered as being more than 100 years old, out of a population of 63,000.Numbers have been less impressive since then, which locals blame variously on radiation from communication towers and environmental decline, but could just as easily be down to more rigorous record-keeping. Today, there are 11 people more than 100 years old, out of a local population of 83,800. Related contentEternal flame: How Azerbaijan became the 'Land of Fire'The tale of the 168-year-old manIs this the world's oldest man ever? Perhaps not. Kamilla RzayevaLerik's current oldest citizen is Raji Ibrahimova, at 105 years. That's a fine vintage, but it pales in comparison to the age reputedly reached by area's most celebrated centenarian, Shirali Muslumov, a shepherd who supposedly lived to be 168. The yellow pages of his passport claim that he was born in 1805 and his gravestone states that he died in 1973. If true, it would make the the oldest person to have ever lived. Unfortunately, back in the early 19th century, birth registrations rarely took place in such remote villages as his birthplace of Barzavu, so there is no certifable record of when he was born. Countless letters sent from all over the world on his various birthdays leave no doubt that he was indeed of a very respectable age, but it's perhaps best to factor in a minimum 20-year margin of error.  Among those corresponding with Muslumov were Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who sent a postcard greeting him with the endearment, ""Dear Grandpa.""This longevity gene seems to run in the family. His 95-year-old daughter, Halima Qambarova, tells CNN Travel that -- while she might not live to 168, like her father -- she at least hopes to live to the age of 150, like her grandfather, or 130, like her aunt. 'Stillness of the mind' When the weather turns cold, most centenarians relocate to the kinder coastal climes of Lankaran, but Qambarova was still in the Lerik village of Barzavu when CNN Travel dropped by her father's modest two-story home, surrounded by massive apple and pear trees (probably contemporaries of her famous father). Sitting by the window, wrapped in a shawl, she speaks with a slight accent, switching often to her native language of Talysh, a dialect spoken by just 200,000 people and classified as ""vulnerable"" by UNESCO. She shows off her passport, which doesn't list a month or date of birth, only the year: 1924. She may be 95, but she is fully present, interacting with her great-grandchildren, and demonstrating her lively sense of humor. When asked her age, she cheerfully replies, ""15."" ""Stillness of the mind is part of their secret,"" the museum guide says. ""They stay away from stress, thinking about life quite philosophically, living one day at a time, without much planning or worry for the future.""Good nutrition and natural remediesHalima Qanbarova is a young thing of 95. Her grandfather is said to have lived to 150, her father to 168, and her aunt to 130. Kamilla RzayevaQambarova's day starts at dawn; she doesn't let herself sleep in. ""I get up as soon as my eyes open,"" she says.She spends the whole day working in the garden or around the house. Her room is small, with a thick soft carpet and pillows on the floor. Many people here prefer sleeping on the ground, with just a thin blanket instead of a mattress, as it's believed to be the healthiest way to rest the back. Contrary to popular belief, the centenarians of Lerik do eat meat, but they inherited a preference for fresh dairy products such as shor (cottage cheese), butter, milk and the yoghurt drink ayran from earlier centenarians, for whom the abstinence from meat was more due to economic circumstance. Qambarova's daughter-in-law brings in a big plate with pears and apples from their garden and some aromatic tea. It's herbal, floral and refreshing. Back at the museum, the guide shows a table with the various herbs native to Lerik. ""The secret of long life is good nutrition, the minerals in the spring water and the herbs that we add to tea to prevent illnesses, so people don't have to take any medicine, only using the natural remedies,"" says the guide. Indeed, Qambarova insists she's never taken any medication. Related contentAzerbaijan: Culinary gateway to the East Generations living side by sideBeyond her windows, it may seem that the village is quiet and still. But the physical work that villagers put in every day is immense. From sunrise until sunset they work in gardens and fields as well as around the house. They sew and knit and take care of big families. Such was the lifestyle of Mammadkhan Abbasov, a 103-year-old from Jangamiran village. Sitting on the carpet, across from the window, the centenarian has almost completely lost his sight and can barely hear his son telling him that guests have arrived, but when he finally catches it, he starts singing, offering prayers and good wishes. At Abbasov's side is his great grandson -- a century gap between them. Just like Qambarova, Abbasov has been a busy villager his whole life, working in the fields until about seven years ago, when his vision deteriorated.'Whatever God gives'Lerik is testament to the benefits of fresh mountain air. Kamilla Rzayeva""He has always been a good man and lived his life properly,"" his son says. In terms of food, he eats ""whatever God gives"" with just one restriction -- he never drinks alcohol. Abbasov attributes his long life to daily physical activity, not to the point of exhaustion, but enough to challenge the body. Along with the good nutrition from the farm products, he also used to drink liters of ice-cold spring water, which is rich with minerals said to contribute to longevity. The headache-inducing altitudes of mountains may also be a factor. A 2017 study by the University of Navarra, Spain, found that living at high elevation decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A 2011 study by the University of Colorado Denver found that these sky-high residents also live longer. The ages of some of these celebrated centenarians may still be disputed, but here in Lerik their legacy lives on through the people that still abide by the simple secret of Lerik's longevity: physical activity, good nutrition, lots of water and an attitude to life that says: We only live once, but if we do it right, once is enough.

This is Yanar Dag -- meaning ""burning mountainside"" -- on Azerbaijan's Absheron Peninsula, where Rahila works as a tour guide.A side effect of the country's plentiful natural gas reserves, which sometimes leak to the surface, Yanar Dag is one of several spontaneously occurring fires to have fascinated and frightened travelers to Azerbaijan over the millennia. Venetian explorer Marco Polo wrote of the mysterious phenomena when he passed through the country in the 13th century. Other Silk Road merchants brought news of the flames as they would travel to other lands. It's why the country earned the moniker the ""land of fire.""

It's purifying, life-sustaining and a vital part of worship.

When snow falls, the flakes dissolve in the air without ever touching the ground, says Rahila. Despite the claimed antiquity of the Yanar Dag flames -- some argue that this particular fire may only have been ignited in the 1950s -- it's a long 30-minute drive north from the center of Baku just to see it.

Fire rituals at this site date back to the 10th century or earlier. The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for ""home of fire"" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent. A natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku's main gas supply and is only lit for visitors. The temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it's as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented.

These were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end. The temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold. The complex became a museum in 1975, was nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998, and today welcomes around 15,000 visitors a year. "

While in the United States, he finished writing ""Le Petit Prince,"" which was eventually published in New York in 1943 in both English and French. Some 600 items related to ""The Little Prince"" are featured in the exhibition.The simple tale, which has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide, is about a child who travels the universe gaining wisdom. Since its initial publication, it has been translated into nearly 500 languages, according to the Museum of Decorative Arts, making it one of the most translated works in the world.The best books of 2021, according to global tastemakersSaint-Exupery, however, did not live to see that reach. He went missing while flying a mission in 1944 and was declared dead in 1945. It took Rivière, who is the head of Saint-Exupery's estate, three years to bring the exhibition to the public -- partly because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. His efforts were supported by publishers and collectors, including the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, which houses the manuscript.Photographs, poems and newspaper cuttings about the book are featured in the exhibition.Saint-Exupery wrote and drew on razor-thin paper nicknamed ""onion skin."" This made the task of transporting the pages of the manuscript, which were all the more fragile due to their age, even more challenging, Rivière said.To ensure their safe transportation, the pages were carefully and professionally framed in New York by the Morgan Library and Museum, he said.The exhibition opened February 17 and is set to run through June 26.

europe,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/europe/russia-us-diplomacy-ukraine-analysis-intl/index.html,"Russian-US diplomacy stalls, with a shelled Ukrainian kindergarten a stark reminder of the lives at stake ","Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN","Moscow (CNN)On any other week, the high-level diplomatic drama that unfolded in Moscow on Thursday should have been the main headline. But the images of a shelled kindergarten in eastern Ukraine shifted international focus to the Donbas region, where the world braced itself for signs that the simmering conflict there might escalate very seriously and catastrophically.    Thankfully, the shell that hit the Stanytsia Luhanska school took no lives. But they were a reminder of the very real stakes for people living near the Line of Contact that separates Ukrainian government forces from Russian-backed separatists.   For weeks, world leaders have been shuttling back and forth to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and making high-level phone calls to try to put the brakes on a confrontation between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis.   Yet in Moscow today, there's been no signs of a breakthrough, but a clear ratcheting up of tension. On Thursday afternoon local time, US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan paid a visit to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he received a long-awaited response from the Russian government to a written document delivered to Russia three weeks earlier.  Is Putin creating a pretext for war? The document made clear that the Russians laid full blame on the US and its allies for stoking the Ukraine crisis, even as evidence continues to mount of that as many as 150,000 Russian troops are arrayed around Ukraine's borders.   Read More""There is no plan for a 'Russian invasion' of Ukraine, as the U.S. and its allies have been alleging at the official level since last Autumn,"" the document, released by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti said. ""Therefore, claims about 'Russian culpability for the escalation' cannot be interpreted as anything other than an attempt to pressure and devalue Russian offers of security guarantees.""  At about the same time, the US State Department confirmed Russia had expelled the second-most senior diplomat at the US diplomatic mission in Moscow, a move that US President Joe Biden's administration called an ""escalatory"" step.That escalation has clearly been incremental: A senior State Department official said that Bart Gorman, the US deputy chief of mission in Moscow was formally expelled by Moscow earlier this year, given two weeks to depart and left Moscow last week.   So where does that leave diplomacy? It's still not entirely dead. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Thursday with his Italian counterpart, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Lavrov essentially laid out the same complaint that was in the written reply delivered to the US: The Americans and NATO have ignored Russia's core security concerns, he said, and none of the secondary issues  -- on the technical details of arms control, for instance  --  can be resolved ""until we agree on our key positions.""   And on those key positions, particularly regarding the issue of who can join NATO, Russia and the West remain very, very far apart.   "

europe,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/europe/dog-owner-recognize-voice-scn-scli-intl/index.html,Dogs can recognize their owners just by their voice,"By Allegra Goodwin, CNN"," (CNN)You might already be sure your dog can recognize you by your voice, but they might not even need their vision or smell to guide them, according to a new study.Dogs can recognize their owners by their voices alone by making use of some of the same voice properties as humans do, such as pitch and noisiness, a team of researchers found.""This is the first demonstration that dogs can tell apart their owner's voice from many others,"" Andics Attila, leader of the lab where the study was carried out, said in a press release Tuesday.The researchers at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, invited 28 dogs and their owners to play hide-and-seek in the lab, with the dogs tasked with finding their owners behind one of two hiding places while a stranger hid behind the other one.Dogs can recognize different languages and nonsense words, study saysThey played the owner's voice from the owner's hiding place, and a stranger's voice from the other hiding place, both reading out recipes in a neutral tone.Read MoreThe dogs had to choose from a distance and find their owners. The game had multiple rounds and the owner's voice was paired with 14 different strangers' voices.The dogs found their owner in 82% of cases, researchers said in the press release.To make sure the dogs were guided by voice alone, and not their sense of smell, in the last two rounds the researchers played the owner's voice from where the stranger hid.The dogs still went to where their owners' voices were coming from, indicating that they did not use their noses in the task.""Dogs' high choosing success rate, their ability to discriminate their owner's voice from a variety of control voices, and the fact that dogs' choices were not confounded by either olfactory cues or speaker order indicate that dogs can reliably use identity cues carried by speech,"" the researchers wrote in the study.Tamás Faragó, senior researcher at the Department of Ethology, Eötvös Loránd University, told CNN Thursday that it could be viewed as ""surprising"" that dogs would not rely more on their sense of smell in such an experiment.Sorry, folks -- your dog doesn't really know what you're talking about ""Probably in a lot of cases dogs have to switch on their nose to find things and they don't just use it routinely all the time,"" he said.Faragó and his team also explored what exactly in the voices helped dogs to know where their owners were, and found that dogs make use of some of the same voice properties as humans to recognize who is talking. These properties include pitch (higher or lower), noisiness (cleaner or harsher), and timbre (brighter or darker).If the owner's and the stranger's voice differed more in pitch and noisiness it helped dogs to recognize their owner's voice, researchers found, whereas timbre and other sound properties did not help the dogs to differentiate between their owner and a stranger.The study's findings could mean dogs may be able to identify their owner's voice over the phone, Faragó said.""This can be important for dogs who have separation anxiety,"" he said, adding this could be a ""real world application"" of the team's findings.""Of course, usually, the dogs meet in person with humans so that they can differentiate us by our looks, and also the smell, and they use all these things, but there are more and more research and technology going into this direction.""The study was published in the Animal Cognition journal February 10."
europe,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/europe/putin-pretext-war-hodge-analysis-intl/index.html,Is Putin creating a pretext for war? ,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN ","Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin is a man who likes to keep his options open, and the Ukraine crisis is no exception: As the Kremlin leader signals his willingness to engage on the diplomatic front, he is also bolstering a case for war.    Take the situation in Donbas, the territories in eastern Ukraine partly controlled by Russian-backed separatists. In a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, Putin dropped the ""g"" word to describe the situation there.   ""According to our estimates, what is happening in the Donbas today is genocide,"" Putin said.  Scholz pushed back, later telling reporters that Putin was ""wrong"" to use the term. But those comments were already out in the public realm -- and Putin had stepped up the rhetoric, much to NATO's concern. ""There are many Russian intelligence officers operating in Ukraine,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday. ""They are present in Donbas, and we have seen attempts to stage a pretext -- false flag operations -- to provide an excuse for invading Ukraine,"" he added.  Read MoreRussia denies that it has troops in Ukraine, and the closest Putin has come to publicly acknowledging the presence of his operatives in Donbas was back in 2015, when pressed on the matter by a Ukrainian journalist. ""We've never said there are no people there who deal with certain matters, including in the military area, but this does not mean that regular Russian troops are present there,"" he said. ""Feel the difference.""Putin's grievances in Donbas aren't new. He has spoken repeatedly about what he describes as the violation of the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, and has stated that it is within Russia's rights to intervene militarily to protect them.   But Putin appears to be making a case for his own version of a ""responsibility to protect,"" however distant the situation in Donbas may be from a Rwanda -- where over 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were killed over the course of 100 days in 1994 -- or Srebrenica -- where more than 7,000 mostly Muslim men and boys were slaughtered in 1995. Russia says its units are going home after exercises near Ukraine. Evidence suggests otherwiseInvoking genocide echoes Russia's false claim that its neighbor, Georgia, committed genocide against civilians in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia in August 2008. During that brief conflict, Russia launched a massive military incursion that pushed deep into Georgian territory, a scenario that worries Western policymakers today when it comes to Ukraine.  The Investigative Committee, Russia's top law enforcement body, took Putin's comments a step further on Wednesday when it announced it had opened a criminal investigation into alleged evidence of what it called ""indiscriminate shelling"" of civilians in the Donbas region by Ukrainian forces since 2014. In a press release laced with politically charged language, the Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal case under Part 1 of Article 356 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which covers mistreatment of the civilian population and the use of means and methods prohibited by an international treaty in an armed conflict.The statement by the Investigative Committee echoed Putin's genocide talk, saying, ""The intent to exterminate the inhabitants of Donbas is obvious -- the Russian investigation recorded hundreds of such facts that qualify as evidence of the use of prohibited means and methods of warfare."" It's clear why the Kremlin wants to change the subject: Back in 2015, for instance, shelling blamed on Russian-backed Donbas separatists claimed the lives of at least 30 people in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.Since conflict in Donbas began in 2014, thousands of civilians have been killed and injured in the fighting, according to United Nations estimates. But announcing an investigation -- not by an independent body, and at the height of a confrontation with Ukraine -- appears to be a clearly political move, whatever the truth of the allegations.  The concern among many observers of the Donbas conflict is that any flare-up -- a fresh outbreak of fighting, an exchange of artillery fire -- could become a pretext for more drastic action by the Russian military. Those concerns were driven home Thursday, after both Ukrainian armed forces and separatists controlling parts of eastern Ukraine reported renewed shelling in the region early Thursday.US says Russia has added 7,000 troops along Ukraine border, despite claims of pullbackVideo and images confirmed by CNN show that a pre-school in Ukrainian-controlled territory was hit by a shell Thursday. The school is three miles from what is known as the Line of Contact, which separates the two sides. CNN has not established who initiated the exchange of fire. Violations of a 2015 ceasefire agreement in the region occur regularly.And then there's also the nettlesome question of the legal status of the separatist regions of Donbas. Russia has never recognized the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), in Donbas, as sovereign and independent states, even as it has handed out Russian passports to people living there. Russian lawmakers earlier this week appealed to the Russian President to recognize the breakaway republics in Donbas as independent. That, too, creates a potential situation where Russia might declare the need to respond to Ukrainian ""aggression"" against those statelets.  Would that happen? Recognition of the DNR and LNR would effectively scuttle the Minsk agreements, a package of measures that, for now, the Kremlin says is the only way to resolve the Ukraine crisis -- and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made clear on Thursday that Putin remained cool to the proposal, emphasizing that the proposal by lawmakers was not a formal bill.   But manufacturing more problems can also benefit the Kremlin: It expands the menu of options at Putin's disposal.   "

Evidence suggests otherwise,"Analysis by Tim Lister, Paul P. Murphy, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Katie Polglase, CNN","Kyiv (CNN)Don't Trust -- Do Verify: That's the unofficial mantra from Western officials in response to Russia's declarations that some of their units that have been encircling Ukraine are now returning to base.  Russia appears keen to prove those declarations to the world through well-produced videos distributed by the Ministry of Defense on Tuesday and Wednesday.In several of those videos, units from the Southern and Western Military Districts were said to be going back to base from Crimea after completing their exercises there. Traffic heading east across the bridge over the Kerch Strait included tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and fuel trucks, which supported the units.Filmed from multiple angles, the videos were designed to reinforce what the Kremlin has insisted all along: that an invasion of Ukraine is not and never has been on its agenda.""Southern Military District troops, which have completed their tasks as part of planned tactical exercises at combined arms ranges on the Crimean peninsula, have begun to return to their permanent deployment points,"" the ministry said Tuesday.Ukraine cyberattack is largest of its kind in country's history, says officialRead MoreBut two of the units leaving, according to Russian newpaper Izvestia, were elements of  the 3rd and 150th Motor Rifle Divisions. They are based close to Ukraine at Rostov-on-Don and Belgorod respectively, a short drive from the border. When those units get home, they will be closer to Ukraine than they were in Crimea.Other Russian footage from Tuesday -- including drone shots -- showed the elaborate departure of T72 tanks from an unidentified rural area.CNN geolocated the location to a training ground near Otreshkovo, a Russian village some 120 kilometers (around 75 miles) from the border. But the direction the departing tank convoy was taking is far from conclusive.The video shows tanks heading in two different directions, both to a railway station and to the training ground.The next day, the defense ministry posted more video of the same unit being loaded onto a train -- and then later published another video of the train rumbling eastwards at night. Its destination is unknown.Russian diplomats have seized on the Defense Ministry's declared pull-back to accuse the West of hysteria in amping up the threat of an invasion.Russia's Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told German newspaper Die Welt on Wednesday that there will be no attack on ""Wednesday, next week, neither in the coming weeks, nor months.""For the United States and NATO, the jury is still out. US President Joe Biden said Tuesday the US assessed there are some 150,000 Russian forces surrounding Ukraine. Blinken says US has seen 'no meaningful pullback' of Russian forces from the Ukraine borderNATO's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg concurred, saying,  ""just that we see movement of forces, so battle tanks, doesn't confirm a real withdrawal. It has been a bit up and down, back and forth all the way. But the trend over the last weeks and months has been a steady increase in the Russian capabilities close to Ukraine's borders."" CNN -- along with a number of independent experts -- continues to monitor and geolocate social media content emerging from Russia and Belarus that show its military on the move.The evidence to hand is that plenty of Russian armor remains close to the Ukrainian border -- and some of it is still moving closer. On Wednesday, T90 tanks were filmed moving through slush in Tomarovka, a village in the Belgorod region of Russia just miles from the Ukrainian frontier, according to multiple videos reviewed.

And in the past week, more helicopters -- for both combat and transport --  have arrived both in Crimea and in areas close to Ukraine's eastern border, according to satellite imagery reviewed by CNN. Those helicopters would provide important air support to any ground offensive.New satellite imagery also shows a curious development in southern Belarus, around six kilometers (approximately four miles) from the Ukrainian border and also close to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. A long pontoon bridge has been built in the last few days across the River Pripyat, not far from where Belarus and Russian forces are carrying out extensive joint exercises.Satellite images taken over the past two days show new road construction and a tactical bridge being built across a key river in Belarus less than four miles from the Ukrainian border.Both the new road construction and the bridge, across the Pripyat River in southern Belarus, are less than 4 miles from the border and could be used by Russian forces currently in Belarus in a drive to Kyiv.While there is little military activity in the immediate area, the bridge would dramatically cut the time needed to reach the Ukrainian border and avoid population centers. An additional satellite image from Planet Labs also shows that after January 8, a new road was constructed that leads to the bridge. Western intelligence and military officials are closely tracking the construction as part of the support infrastructure Russia is putting in place in advance of a potential invasion, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Still, past exercises in the area have included the construction of pontoons, highlighting a well-known dilemma in intelligence capture: how to reconcile growing and changing capabilities with unknown intent. Another as yet unexplained development: Maxar had previously observed the establishment of a large detachment of Russian forces - including tanks - near the town of in south-eastern Belarus, some 30 miles from the border.  Those forces appear to have dispersed, Maxar says, noting that a ""military convoy was seen moving west on today's imagery.""Russian forces, including tanks, appear to have dispersed from a camp near Rechytsa, Belarus.  In one of the satellite images, a convoy of vehicles is seen moving west, deeper into Belarus. Analysts say it will take at least several days to establish whether there is a true drawdown of Russian forces from temporary positions around Ukraine, or whether -- as many western officials believe -- it's more maneuvering. The Conflict Intelligence Team, which has long experience tracking Russian military movements, told CNN: ""We are currently unable to either confirm or deny any actual withdrawal happening. We've seen vehicles of the 58th army of the Southern Military District being loaded on trains in Crimea (where they had previously deployed unannounced), but we would need some additional time and evidence to say if they are actually withdrawing to their permanent bases.""Konrad Muzyka, an analyst at Rochan Consulting, an aerospace and defense consultancy said in a tweet, ""Previously announced withdrawals meant more Russian troop deployments near Ukraine. New trains with equipment keep on arriving. The withdrawal would be a welcome development, but recent history tells us these announcements are not genuine. Need a few days to verify."" In January and early February, dozens of social media videos showed Russian forces heading towards Ukraine's borders nearly every day. So far, there's been no similar surge of content showing those forces moving in the opposite direction.Katie Bo Lillis and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this story."

europe,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/europe/ukraine-russia-news-wednesday/index.html,"Russian buildup continues, but insufficient for full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence says ","Exclusive by Matthew Chance, CNN ","Kyiv, Ukraine  (CNN)Russia's buildup of troops at Ukraine's borders has persisted, despite Moscow's claims of a drawdown, but the number of Russian forces remains insufficient for an invasion, according to a Ukrainian intelligence report shared exclusively with CNN. The total number of Russian troops at the border has increased in recent days to more than 148,000, including more than 126,000 ground troops, the report says, echoing US intelligence about the build-up. A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson affirmed the reporting in comments to CNN ahead of an address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was sending some of its troops at the border back to base after completing exercises. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg rejected Putin's claim and said the military buildup was continuing, describing it as ""the most serious crisis in decades."" A Ukrainian serviceman runs during an exercise in the Joint Forces Operation, in the Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2022. A statement by NATO later on Wednesday said the buildup was ""very large scale, unprovoked and unjustified."" NATO also said it was deploying additional land forces in the eastern part of the alliance, in addition to maritime and air assets. The measures, the statement said, remained ""proportionate"" and ""non-escalatory,"" in response to the ""serious threat"" of the Russian troop buildup. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said that there was ""no meaningful pullback.""Read More""Unfortunately there's a difference between what Russia says and what it does. And what we're seeing is no meaningful pullback,"" Blinken said on ABC's Good Morning America.""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border,"" he said.The US alleged on Wednesday evening that Russian forces massed along Ukraine's borders have increased by approximately 7,000 troops in recent days, with a senior US administration official saying the increase renders Russia's assertion of withdrawal ""false."" The official said that Putin's public openness to diplomacy was a guise, saying, ""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war.""

BTGs are formations that consist of 800 to 1,000 Russian troops. The numbers are consistent with the latest US assessment of the Russian troop buildup, but deviates from Western statements by playing down the threat of a full-scale invasion. Biden seeks to shore up his domestic flank in his showdown with Putin""The Russian military contingent near the Ukrainian border is insufficient to carry out a successful large-scale armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the report said. Instead, Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia has focused its efforts on ""destabilizing Ukraine's internal situation"" using punitive economic and energy-related tactics, as well as cyberattacks. Largest cyberattack of its kindA high-volume cyberattack that temporarily blocked access to the websites of Ukrainian defense agencies and banks on Tuesday was ""the largest (such attack) in the history of Ukraine,"" according to a government minister.Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who is also the minister of digital transformation, added that it is too early to tell who was responsible for the attack.The so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack -- which bombarded Ukrainian websites with phony traffic -- was coordinated and well planned, officials said.DDoS attacks often disrupt access to IT systems, but their impact can be more psychological rather than having any direct effect on a country's critical infrastructure.'Day of Unity'Meanwhile on Wednesday, Ukraine marked a so-called ""Day of Unity"" -- called for by Zelensky -- as a show of defiance against Russia. Hundreds of people observed flag-raising ceremonies in some of Ukraine's city centers. ""This gathering is how we show our power to Putin,"" Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy told CNN. Speaking from the port city of Mariupol, which is believed to be vulnerable to attack in the case of an invasion, Zelensky vowed to ""not succumb"" to Russian provocations. ""We are not intimidated by any predictions (of war), any people, enemies, or any dates, because we will defend ourselves, whether it's February 16th, 17th, or 18th -- in March or April or September or December,"" he said. ""What's important is this is the year 2022, not 2014. We've become much stronger,"" Zelensky added, referring to Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Ukraine blamed Russia for Tuesday's cyberattack. Authorities have only raised the possibility that Moscow could have been behind the incident."

Justice Minister Judit Varga said Brussels was abusing its powers against national member states.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference: ""Poland believes that centralization, bureaucratic centralization, federalization... is a dangerous process.""The EU has already frozen pandemic recovery funds worth 36 billion euros ($41 billion) for Poland and 7 billion euros for Hungary. The so-called ""conditionality mechanism"" could now affect any part of the EU budget, worth 1.8 trillion euros ($2 trillion) for 2021-27.Poland, the biggest formerly communist EU member with 38 million people, is eligible for more than 75 billion euros through 2027, including for climate, digitalization and public health. Hungary has a population around a quarter the size but has received an even greater share of EU spending per capita.Poland ignites EU anger with ruling that its laws supersede bloc's treaties""Hungary and Poland have been rapidly backsliding on media freedom, independence of judges, the right to protest,"" said Amnesty International. ""Instead of trying to oppose EU funds being conditional on respect for the rule of law, they should respect people's rights and clean up their act.""EU officials said the bloc might move on Hungary first, while political horse-trading would probably delay a decision to withhold funds at least until late this year.Poland and Hungary have threatened to retaliate by stalling other EU decisions that require unanimity, including on climate and energy, as well as foreign policy.Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told Reuters that the dispute would not lead Hungary to block an EU-Africa summit later this week or interfere with any potential sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.Katalin Cseh, a liberal Hungarian EU lawmaker, said ignoring the erosion of the rule of law in Poland and Hungary would be comparable to the dark comedy film ""Don't Look Up"", in which politicians fail to stop an asteroid from destroying the Earth.""If we are sitting tight and assessing, then Mr Orban and Mr Morawiecki would achieve their goal of destroying the Union from within,"" she said.

europe,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/europe/russia-troops-bases-analysis-intl/index.html,Russia says it's moving some troops to their bases. What does this mean?,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN","Moscow (CNN)On Wednesday, Belarus' foreign minister said ""not a single"" Russian soldier or piece of military equipment would remain in its territory after joint military drills conclude, while the Russian Ministry of Defense released video showing military equipment crossing the bridge from Crimea into Russia. This all comes a day after Russia announced that some troops would be returning to their home bases after completing exercises -- but President Joe Biden said the US had not yet verified any drawdown of the 150,000 Russian troops amassed near Ukraine's borders.How significant are the latest developments?Let's start with what we know. The statement given on Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, was very short on specifics. Troops of Russia's Southern and Western Military Districts, he said, had begun loading up their gear to return to their bases, but gave few specifics about where those units had been exercising, what their home stations are, or how many troops in total were heading home.  What's more, we know from Ministry of Defense news releases that exercises in Belarus involve a significant number of troops from around the Russian Federation, including units based in Russia's Eastern Military District -- several time zones east of European Russia, a massive region bounded at its eastern edge by the Pacific Ocean.  Read MoreRussia says it's withdrawing some troops following exercises around Ukraine, but major drills continueRussia is a massive country spanning 11 time zones; its military divides the country into five administrative territories: the Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Districts and the Northern Fleet.Troops leaving exercises in Crimea -- annexed by Russia in 2014 -- were technically exercising inside Russia's Southern Military District. Troops of the Southern Military District could potentially be returning to bases in the north Caucasus or Rostov oblast.  Tuesday's statements, then, gives us very little official clue about how significant this move is: It could easily be a rotation -- with fresh troops falling in -- or a gradual drawdown after exercises. And Konashenkov made it clear that Russia's current exercises at sea have a fairly global sweep, taking place in ""operationally important areas of the world's oceans"" and in the waters adjacent to the territory of Russia. There are things to watch out for in the coming days. Putin and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko are set to meet this week, and we may get some hint on when the exercises in Belarus will conclude -- and when Russian soldiers there will go home.  Asked about whether a decision on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus would be made during that meeting, Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said: ""Let's not jump ahead. Let's wait for the meeting."" What the US is watching that could signal Russia is launching an invasion of UkraineIn the meantime, some Western officials were skeptical of the Russian troop announcement and said there had been no proof that a de-escalation of the crisis is on the cards.   ""The signs coming from Moscow about willingness to continue to engage in diplomatic efforts ... gives some reason for cautious optimism. But we will, of course, follow very closely what's happening on the ground and whether this is reflected in some real de-escalation of the Russian military build-up in around Ukraine,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Tuesday."

They are seeking asylum in Ukraine, but fear for the future of their adopted homeland.Boryspil, Ukraine (CNN)Sisters Fazila and Shagufa Haidary once travelled the world as flight attendants, rubbing shoulders with politicians and pop stars.Now they sit together in a small apartment on the outskirts of Kyiv, scrolling through TikTok to keep themselves occupied.Having fled the Taliban and decades of war in their native Afghanistan, the sisters find themselves at risk of being caught up in another conflict in their adopted home, Ukraine.""Now, we are in the middle of nowhere,"" says Shagufa. ""We just came out of a single trauma, and I think we are going to face another trauma.""The latest on Ukraine and Russia tensionsThe pair are torn between their yearning for the past, the loved ones they left behind, and their fears for a deeply uncertain future.Read MoreFazila, 26, and Shagufa, 24, are the youngest siblings in a large family. Members of the Hazara ethnic minority, their roots are in Bamyan, central Afghanistan.Despite the trials and tribulations of daily life in Afghanistan, the sisters describe their life before last summer as ""the golden days.""They were enrolled in university and their day jobs as flight attendants allowed them to travel widely. At work, Fazila says she met everyone from former Afghan President Hamid Karzai to the Afghan pop star Aryana Sayeed.Shagufa, left, and Fazila worked as flight attendants in Afghanistan.When the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15, 2021, they felt they had no choice but to leave.""We had no other option,"" recalls Shagufa. ""We had to catch a flight and flee. And that was it. If we had any other option, we would definitely choose another option rather than be a refugee or end up here.""The sisters intended to go to Islamabad in Pakistan but arrived at Kabul's airport too late. They found themselves caught up in the chaos of thousands of people trying to get out of the country. Taliban bans women from solo, long-distance road trips in Afghanistan""The feeling at that time was horrifying,"" says Shagufa, describing the huge crowds of Afghans, all desperate to flee. ""We were all terrified and clueless, because we didn't know where we were going.""The sisters say that, together with some work colleagues, they made their way to a plane parked on a remote part of the tarmac. They had no idea where it was headed until minutes before take-off.""We were hopeful. It's like, 'Ah, finally! We made it,'"" says Shagufa, sighing and dropping her head in mock exaggeration.But the relief of escaping danger soon gave way to the hard reality of life as an asylum-seeker in a strange country.Shagufa and Fazila say they have struggled to find jobs in their field, despite being permitted to work.A new life in UkraineFazila and Shagufa were among a group of 370 Afghans who arrived in Ukraine on evacuation flights in August 2021, according to Ukraine's State Migration Service. Definitive figures are hard to come by, but activists estimate that around 5,000 Afghans live in Ukraine.On arrival in the country -- one that they had never been to before -- they say authorities took them to a housing facility for migrants some two hours north of Kyiv, close to the border with Belarus.Two weeks later, thanks to the help of a friend who works for a Ukrainian airline, they were able to move into a furnished apartment in a modest housing block on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv.But the sisters say they now doubt whether leaving Afghanistan was the right decision.""If I would know that living life here, (that) it would be such a challenge and so difficult, I would not choose to be (a) refugee. Believe me. Never,"" says Shagufa.The sisters say they are expecting a decision on their asylum application soon. 
The Haidary sisters have filed for asylum in Ukraine and are expecting a decision within weeks.But with their application still pending, they say they have struggled to find work in their field -- despite having Ukrainian documentation allowing them to get jobs. Beyond an initial grant of 3,200 Ukrainian hryvnia (around US $112) when they first arrived in Ukraine, they say they have faced consistent indifference from the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR.""They are pretending that they are helping us,"" said Shagufa. ""But in reality, it's nothing. When you want to go to them or ... when you want to talk with them ... it's totally different.""Russia has surrounded Ukraine on three sides. Here's where an invasion could be launchedIn a statement to CNN, Victoria Andrievska, a spokesperson for UNHCR Ukraine, said that it ""provides legal assistance to some 300 Afghan asylum seekers, and also provides financial support in the form of an allowance granted for newly arrived asylum seekers.""UNHCR also clarified that while it expresses ""solidarity"" with countries that took in Afghans last summer, it ""was not involved in the evacuation of Afghan citizens who have assisted foreign governments or military forces in Afghanistan,"" and that it was not responsible for visa arrangements.And yet despite the hardship, signs of joy -- and the strength that the sisters give each other -- remain.When, at the start of our visit, Fazila introduces herself and says she lives in Kabul, the sisters break down in uncontrollable giggles. Shagufa prods her with delight: ""You live in Kabul?!""Uncertainty amid tensions with RussiaNow the sisters face the same uncertainty as everyone else in Kyiv. For the moment, things are calm and life is going on as usual, but the possibility of imminent war is growing -- at least according to foreign leaders.US President Joe Biden said Tuesday that Russia has more than 150,000 troops massed on three sides of Ukraine.Russia denies that it is planning to attack, but the United States believes an invasion could be underway even before the Winter Olympics in Beijing end later this week.Recent intelligence from the US and its allies suggests Kyiv could be among Russia's targets.

http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnnlatest,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/kevin-mccarthy-harriet-hageman-endorsement/index.html,McCarthy endorses Cheney foe in Wyoming GOP primary,"By Ryan Nobles, Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona, CNN"," (CNN)House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has endorsed Harriet Hageman, the Trump-backed opponent of incumbent Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming -- a rare endorsement from leadership in a divisive GOP primary, and one that marks the culmination of a simmering feud between the two powerful Republicans battling over the future of their party.The tension between the two began in the wake of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol when Cheney called for her party to move on from former President Donald Trump and voted to impeach him, while McCarthy chose to cozy up to the former President. Cheney's criticism of Trump led to his backers in the House to successfully push for her to be removed from her position as the chairwoman of the GOP Conference. It was a move McCarthy initially resisted, but ultimately backed.""I am proud to endorse Harriet Hageman for Congress,"" McCarthy said in a statement Thursday. ""[Throughout] her career, Harriet has championed America's natural resources and helped the people of Wyoming reject burdensome and onerous government overreach."" The California Republican later explained his endorsement in remarks to Fox's Sean Hannity.""Wyoming deserves to have a representative who will deliver the accountability against this Biden administration. Not a representative that they have today that works closer with Nancy Pelosi, going after Republicans instead of stopping these radical Democrats from what they're doing to this country,"" McCarthy said.Read MoreHageman responded to the endorsement in a statement, saying, ""I am very grateful for Leader McCarthy's strong support, and I pledge that when I am Wyoming's congresswoman, I will always stand up for our beautiful state and do the job I was sent there to do.""McCarthy's endorsement was first reported by the Federalist.The policy of the National Republican Congressional Committee is that they do not get involved in primaries with incumbents, but individual members of leadership are free to do as they please. Still, McCarthy has generally stayed out of these intraparty battles. His gamble is that the goodwill this endorsement will earn him with Trump and his backers will outweigh the risk that Cheney could win and thereby show that his support is not that valuable. That dangerous calculus is generally why leaders stay out of primaries.However, as CNN reported earlier month, McCarthy is facing increased pressure from the Trump-aligned wing of the GOP conference that is pushing for him to take action against Cheney and fellow Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois for their roles on the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. While McCarthy has held off intense efforts to boot the duo out of the Republican conference, he ultimately was able to convince members of the hardline Freedom Caucus that a better course of action would be to become active in the primary of Cheney. Kinzinger has decided not to run for reelection.Initially, McCarthy refused to say if he planned to endorse Hageman.While McCarthy's decision will be welcomed by members of the Freedom Caucus and could help him stave off a potential challenge for the speaker's gavel should Republicans win back the majority, it won't come without a cost. Many rank-and-file Republicans are uncomfortable with members of the party turning on each other and fear it could ultimately hurt their efforts to win elections in competitive districts.""I think the party should try and continue to work with them,"" said Texas Rep. Pete Sessions. ""I think this is a fight between Donald Trump and (Kinzinger and Cheney), not the party.""It will also make life even more difficult for the 10 Republican members who voted to impeach Trump. The former President has made a pledge to take each one of them out and has already recruited and endorsed candidates in several other races.Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Washington state Republican who is among the group that voted to impeach Trump for inciting the Capitol attack, said: ""I would hate to see that happen,"" referring to GOP leaders potentially backing Cheney's primary foe. ""This is a distraction that we shouldn't be engaged in,"" Newhouse said. ""We should be focused on truly who our opponents are.""And while siding with Cheney's opponent may help McCarthy to calm the concerns of the far-right Republicans in his caucus but it is by no means a guarantee they will all back him in a potential bid for speaker. During a recent episode of his podcast, GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of McCarthy's biggest critics, gleefully agreed when former Fox host Lou Dobbs suggested that either Gaetz or Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan should run for speaker.""I personally believe him to be a RINO,"" Dobbs said of McCarthy while Gaetz nodded in agreement. ""The party needs strength, it needs vision, it needs vibrancy, it needs new blood. It needs new leadership, it is just that simple.""For her part, Cheney has continued on with her campaign undeterred, outraising Hageman by large sums and drawing support from traditional Republicans like her father the former Vice President Dick Cheney and former President George W. Bush.The Cheney camp downplayed the significance of McCarthy's support for Hageman.""Wow, she must be really desperate,"" Cheney spokesman Jeremy Adler said.This story has been updated with additional comments from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.CNN's Brian Rokus contributed to this report."

Wolf, CNN","A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  (CNN)Far from a de-escalation, the standoff between Russia and the US over Ukraine feels more tense each day.President Joe Biden warned on Thursday that an attack on Ukraine could come in days.The White House also accused Russia of conducting ""Potemkin diplomacy"" -- a reference to the 18th-century Russian ""Potemkin villages,"" facades without anything behind them.Fake diplomacy? That's because while Russia claims to be trying to defuse the situation and pulling back, the US is seeing evidence to the contrary and warns Russia could launch a false-flag attack -- something to essentially justify an invasion of Ukraine.Possible false-flag scenarios the US anticipates include: Read MoreClaims of provocation in the Donbas region.A claim of NATO activity in land or air. Claims of an incursion into Russian territory. False claims about mass graves, chemical or biological weapons activity, guerrilla activity or genocide.LISTEN: Tensions rise over Russia-Ukraine conflictMaking the case. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken went to the United Nations Thursday and laid out the American case. He told the Security Council that Russia is laying the groundwork to justify starting a war and preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine in the coming days. ""Here today, we are laying it out in great detail with the hope that by sharing what we know with the world, we can influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there's still time,"" he said.RELATED: US says Russia plans to manufacture justification for warBlinken then traveled to Munich for a global security conference, along with Vice President Kamala Harris. She will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and other European leaders.A sort of unity in the US. While the US mission is to convince world powers that Russia is the aggressor and line up support to hold the country accountable, the American politics of the Russia-Ukraine situation are different. Republicans and Democrats, for now, sound relatively unified.Praising Biden. Here's Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday talking about President Joe Biden's comments earlier in the week:What created the new, more aggressive Putin""(Biden) was right to emphasize that the world will not shrug or stand idly by if Vladimir Putin tries to invade his neighbor, or redraw the map of Europe through deadly force,"" McConnell said.He added that Biden would have ""overwhelming bipartisan support to use his existing executive authorities for tough sanctions against Russia in the event of conflict.""But there's a difference between bipartisan agreement and actual bipartisan action.Blaming Biden. While McConnell praised Biden and blessed his use of executive action, he blamed Biden for weakness in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he argued created a power vacuum.""But for the catastrophe in Afghanistan, there's not a doubt in my mind -- not a doubt in my mind -- that the Russians wouldn't be on the border of Ukraine with 100,000 or more troops, had we not indicated to the rest of the world we were pulling the plug on Afghanistan and going home,"" McConnell told reporters Tuesday.A failed sanctions effort. Separately, lawmakers have so far failed to pass a bipartisan slate of sanctions against Russia.A sanctions bill likely won't pass before a Russian invasion of Ukraine, if one should occur. The House and Senate are both scheduled to be out of session next week around the Presidents Day holiday. The Senate, however, did approve a symbolic resolution condemning Russia Thursday evening. The resolution, which almost didn't make it to the floor after Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul objected to it, condemns Russia for its aggressive actions toward Ukraine. Still, there are several differences between the parties, in particular over:How to address the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which Russia wants to install around Ukraine to pump natural gas into Germany.How to punish Russian bankers.Democrats argue the differences are technical. Here's Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, speaking on Capitol Hill Thursday:""We actually have agreed on the package,"" Kaine told reporters. ""It's just that we have a different view on what should trigger the sanctions -- should we do it before an invasion or should we wait for invasion -- but both sides are together, Democrat and Republican, on what we will do.""A GOP proposal. Republicans in the Senate, while not agreeing to a bipartisan proposal, introduced their own sanctions bill Tuesday, which Democrats slammed as political posturing since it includes a lot of things that were in the bipartisan bill.The Republican bill is called the Never Yielding Europe's Territory (NYET) Act.NYET. Get it? It's Russian for ""no.""It would ""mandate sanctions"" on the Nord Stream 2 project ""without a waiver should Russia invade,"" a release about the Act said, and it would sanction Putin's ""cronies, enablers and major banks,"" along with providing $500 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine. Read more from CNN's Lauren Fox.Republicans like Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, who introduced the GOP bill, say if there is an invasion, a bipartisan sanctions bill will pass quickly.There are steps the White House is taking even without a sanctions package. On Monday, Blinken announced up to $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine.The US, under executive authority, will also double ""funding for US military exercises in Europe,"" and create a new State Department Foreign Military Financing program for Eastern Europe to ""help European allies strengthen their own defensive capabilities,"" according to a release.""A new normal."" There may be plenty of time for Republicans and Democrats to come together on Russia and Ukraine.NATO's Stoltenberg told CNN on Thursday the West will have to live, on some level, with this more aggressive Russia.""Regardless of whether Russia invades Ukraine or not, what we have seen so far I'm afraid represents a new normal because what we have seen is that Russia has been willing to amass large number of combat ready troops to try to intimidate and threaten Ukraine, but also try to threaten NATO allies,"" he said.Global coordination. Biden will convene a call on Friday with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, European Union and NATO to discuss the Ukraine crisis, a source familiar with the plans told CNN.A White House official told the pool, ""The President will speak with trans-Atlantic leaders on a phone call tomorrow afternoon about Russia's buildup of military troops on the border of Ukraine and our continued efforts to pursue deterrence and diplomacy.""This story has been updated with additional information Thursday.CNN's Paul LeBlanc, Kaitlan Collins, Ellie Kaufman and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report."

At the time of the fire's outbreak, the ship was sailing 90 nautical miles southwest of Portugal's Azores, according to a statement on Wednesday by the Portuguese Navy. After the fire broke out in the cargo hold, it spread and forced all 22 crew members to abandon ship. According to another statement by the Portuguese Navy, the crew was safely picked up and taken to a local hotel, with the rescue coordinated by the Ponta Delgada Maritime Search and Rescue Coordination Center. There has been no noticeable source of pollution from the fire, according to the statement.The ship's owners have arranged for a tow as it continues to burn. Registered to Panama, the Felicity Alice is operated by Japanese shipping line Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL). MOL has not responded to request for comment.

Japan's Kaori Sakamoto finished in third.Valieva was tipped for gold in the event but fell numerous times during her free skate routine. Standing by the 15-year-old was her coach Eteri Tutberidze on whom the spotlight now falls.In a sample taken in December, prior to the Olympics, Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine, a drug commonly used to treat angina and which experts say can enhance endurance by increasing blood flow to the heart. Kamila Valiyeva (R) talks to her coach Eteri Tutberidze during a training session in Beijing. Pictured behind them is ROC physician Filipp Shvetsky. Valieva blamed her positive drug test on a mix-up that occurred with her grandfather's medication, Denis Oswald, the Chair of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Disciplinary Commission, told reporters Tuesday. Read MoreHowever, the results only came to light during the Olympics. Last week, the Court of Arbitration for Sport gave Valieva the green light to continue competing in the Games because of the exceptional circumstances of her being a minor.The fact that Valieva is a child and failed a drug test has put renewed focus on the adults around her and the alleged dark underworld of Russian figure skating beneath the glittering surface. ""It is clearly a wish and a decision of the IOC but also WADA to examine all aspects of this case including the situation of the entourage, because of course you can imagine a girl of 15 would not do something wrong alone -- so yes, the entourage will be investigated,"" said Oswald.Global Athlete, an athlete-led group working for change across the sporting world, called Valieva's positive drug test ""evidence of abuse of a minor.""Kamila Valyeva of the Russian Olympic Committee in action Thursday night at Beijing's Capital Indoor Stadium. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which regulates the use of drugs in international sport, said it will be investigating the 15-year-old's entourage -- the adults responsible for her skating and welfare.CNN has reached out to the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) for comment from Tutberidze and ROC team doctor Filipp Shvetsky on the points raised in this story but has not received a response.""These (past few) days have been very difficult for me,"" Valieva told Russia's Channel One earlier this week, after training. ""It's as if I don't have any emotions left. I am happy, but at the same time, I am emotionally tired.""Valieva's coach in the spotlightAt the center of the controversy -- and the Russian skating world -- is Valieva's coach, Eteri Tutberidze. Frequently called the most powerful woman in figure skating, Tutberidze is the driving force behind Russia's dominance in the sport. Her studio in Moscow attracts the best female figure skaters from around Russia, who are trained from an early age to break records and perform dazzlingly complex jumps, multiple coaches and skaters told CNN. Valieva made history last week by becoming the first woman to land a quad at the Olympics, and recent female Russian skaters have been known for pushing boundaries on the tricks they can do, from triple axels to triple flips and other difficult combinations. ""We are absolutely sure that Kamila is innocent and clean,"" Tutberidze told Russian TV last week. Tutberidze is also infamous for her brutal training regimens.  In a December interview with Russian TV, she said her skaters train 12 hours a day, saying they can ""always do more, demand more from yourself.""Yulia Lipnitskaia (R) and her coach Eteri Tutberidze during the Sochi Winter Olympics on February 20, 2014. The coach has trained a string of Olympic medalists, but scrutiny has also been cast on how her best protégées have had short-lived careers. Like Valieva, Yulia Lipnitskaya was 15 when she helped Russia win gold in the team event at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. But at 19 years old, Lipitskaya retired from figure skating following a battle with anorexia and injuries. Evgenia Medvedeva was 18 when she won two silver medals at the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics, one each for the single and team event. The two-time world champion unofficially retired from competition last year citing back injuries. And Medvedeva's teammate Alina Zagitova, who won gold in PyeongChang at the age of 15, announced an indefinite break from competition at 19. Zagitova's dominance was record breaking: she was Russia's first skater to win Olympic gold, the World Figure Skating Championships, European Figure Skating Championships and the Grand Prix of Figure Skating. All three were coached by Tutberidze. But Tutberidze also has a lot of supporters. Russian figure skater-turned-coach Anna Pogorilaya, who briefly trained with Tutberidze at her studio, described her as ""an iron lady,"" in an interview with CNN.""She is so dedicated to her vocation... for her, every athlete is like her own child,"" she said, adding that she doesn't believe Tutberidze would pressure her skaters to take performance enhancing drugs. ""I am 100% sure she cannot force her athlete to take anything... I am 100% sure they are clean,"" Pogorilaya said. Team doctor was banned for doping violationsAnother adult close to Valieva is the ROC team doctor Filipp Shvetsky.   The World Rowing Federation confirmed to CNN that Shvetsky was team doctor for the Russian rowing team.He was banned by Russia in 2007 over doping violations, according to Jim Walden, a lawyer for Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, who is under witness protection in the United StatesWorld Rowing says three members of the Russian Rowing Federation were declared ineligible for two years because of violations of the World Anti-Doping Code. He was reinstated by Russia in 2010. ""But this guy (Shvetsky) who's got a history with performance enhancing drugs suddenly shows up as the doctor for this 15-year-old skater... and allegedly, she tests positive for a performance enhancing drug,"" said Walden.ROC figure skating coaches Dannil Gleikhengauz, Eteri Tutberidze (L-R front) and team doctor Filipp Shvetsky attend a training session in Beijing. Walden said Valieva's situation should be looked at within the context of Russia's state-sponsored doping scandal. Russian athletes competing at the Olympics are already under the shadow of a history of illegal doping: WADA barred Russia from international competitions in 2019 over doping violations. Under the ban set to expire later this year, they've only been able to participate as neutrals in the Games.Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, defected to the US and formed the basis of the 2016 McLaren Report which found that more than 1,000 Russian athletes benefited from a systematic doping program between 2011 and 2015. Dozens of Russian athletes were banned after the 2014 Sochi Olympics -- where Russian athletes won more medals than any other country. Opinion: Even if Kamila Valieva wins, she losesRussia continues to deny Rodchenkov's accusations and has said he had personally given drugs to the athletes, who were unaware they were taking banned substances.Under the ban set to expire later this year, Russian athletes have only been able to participate if they can prove they are clean. They compete under the banner of the Russian Olympic Committee, not technically under the Russian flag. ""Russia's not writing on a clean slate. Russia has had a state sponsored doping program since at least the 1960s. It is very well established, it is heavily documented. And so when any Russian athlete tests positive, the Russian state is not doing anyone any favors because there is now a presumption of guilt instead of a presumption of innocence, which for a 15-year-old skater is terrible,"" Walden said. In 2020, the US government signed into law the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, allowing it to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international sports competitions that feature American athletes, sponsors and broadcasters. Walden suggested the US could use the law against Valieva's entourage.""I'm very sure that the FBI and the Department of Justice are going to be investigating already to try to make an example out of the Russian trainers, doctors, coaches, etc. that were responsible for putting this young athlete in harm's way,"" he said.Russian athletes and heart medicationsValieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine and the investigation into the merits of that positive test is ongoing. But it is not the first time Russian athletes have been pulled up for using the drug, or a ""close relative"" of the drug, Walden said.Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova served a 15-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance meldonium in 2016. Sharapova denied doping and said she was first prescribed meldonium in 2006 for heart issues and was unaware the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had recently added it to the banned substance list because she was taking the drug prescribed under another name. The normal course of treatment, according to the drug's prescribing label, is a matter of days to weeks. It is not known why Sharapova's doctor continued to prescribe the drug for years.In PyeongChang 2018, two Russian athletes -- mixed doubles curler Alexander Krushelnitckii and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva -- were excluded from walking behind the national flag during the Closing Ceremony after testing positive for banned substances. Krushelnitckii tested positive for meldonium and Sergeeva tested positive in an out-of-competition test for trimetazidine.Kamila Valieva (R) and Eteri Tutberidze attend a training session on February 12, 2022.""So not only does Russia have a long history of state-sponsored doping, they have a history with this specific drug,"" Walden said. In an interview with Russian TV in 2019, Valieva's coach Tutberidze defended meldonium as harmless, saying that it just ""helps to recuperate the heart muscles."" The ROC said in previous statements that Valieva had ""repeatedly passed doping tests"" while already in Beijing, adding that it is taking measures to keep Valieva's ""honestly won"" gold.""The doping test of an athlete who tested positive does not apply to the period of the Olympic Games. At the same time, the athlete repeatedly passed doping tests before and after December 25, 2021, including while already in Beijing during the figure skating tournament. All the results are negative,"" the ROC statement said.""The Russian Olympic Committee is taking comprehensive measures to protect the rights and interests of the members of the ROC Team, and to keep the honestly won Olympic gold medal.""All of the figure skaters have poured years of blood, sweat and tears to be at the Olympics, but the doping scandal has threatened to steal their moment, and the Games may best be remembered not by performance, but by performance enhancing drugs."

http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnnlatest,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/ba-2-covid-severity/index.html,"As BA.2 subvariant of Omicron rises, lab studies point to signs of severity","By Brenda Goodman, CNN"," (CNN)The BA.2 virus -- a subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant -- isn't just spreading faster than its distant cousin, it may also cause more severe disease and appears capable of thwarting some of the key weapons we have against Covid-19, new research suggests.  New lab experiments from Japan show that BA.2 may have features that make it as capable of causing serious illness as older variants of Covid-19, including Delta.  And like Omicron, it appears to largely escape the immunity created by vaccines. A booster shot restores protection, making illness after infection about 74% less likely.BA.2 is also resistant to some treatments, including sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody that's currently being used against Omicron.  Dr. Tom Frieden: Why I'm cautiously optimistic about Covid-19The findings were posted Wednesday as a preprint study on the bioRxiv server, before peer review. Normally, before a study is published in medical journal, it is scrutinized by independent experts. Preprints allow research to be shared more quickly, but they are posted before that additional layer of review.Read More""It might be, from a human's perspective, a worse virus than BA.1 and might be able to transmit better and cause worse disease,"" says Dr. Daniel Rhoads, section head of microbiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Rhoads reviewed the study but was not involved in the research.BA.2 is highly mutated compared with the original Covid-causing virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. It also has dozens of gene changes that are different from the original Omicron strain, making it as distinct from the most recent pandemic virus as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were from each other. Kei Sato, a researcher at the University of Tokyo who conducted the study, argues that these findings prove that BA.2 should not be considered a type of Omicron and that it needs to be more closely monitored.CDC unveils its latest weapon in Covid-19 detection: wastewater""As you may know, BA.2 is called 'stealth Omicron,' "" Sato told CNN. That's because it doesn't show up on PCR tests as an S-gene target failure, the way Omicron does.  Labs therefore have to take an extra step and sequence the virus to find this variant. ""Establishing a method to detect BA.2 specifically would be the first thing"" many countries need to do, he says.""It looks like we might be looking at a new Greek letter here,"" agreed Deborah Fuller, a virologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but was not part of the research.Mixed real-world data on subvariant's severityBA.2 is about 30% to 50% more contagious than Omicron. It has been detected in 74 countries and 47 US states.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 4% of Americans with Covid-19 now have infections caused by BA.2, but many other parts of the world have more experience with this variant.  It has become dominant in at least 10 other countries: Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Denmark, Guam, India, Montenegro, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines, according to World Health Organization's weekly epidemiological report.But, there's mixed evidence on the severity of BA.2 in the real world.  Hospitalizations continue to decline in countries where BA.2 has gained a foothold, like South Africa and the UK.  But in Denmark, where BA.2 has become the leading cause of infections, hospitalizations and deaths are rising, according to WHO.Resistant to monoclonal antibody treatmentsThe new study found that BA.2 can copy itself in cells more quickly than BA.1, the original version of Omicron.  It's also more adept at causing cells to stick together.  This allows the virus to create larger clumps of cells, called syncytia, than BA.1.  That's concerning because these clumps then become factories for churning out more copies of the virus. Delta was also good at creating syncytia, which is thought to be one reason it was so destructive to the lungs.When the researchers infected hamsters with BA.2 and BA.1, the animals infected with BA.2 got sicker and had worse lung function. In tissues samples, the lungs of BA.2-infected hamsters had more damage than those infected by BA.1.How worried should we be about the new 'stealth' Omicron? Our expert weighs inSimilar to the original Omicron, BA.2 was capable of breaking through antibodies in the blood of people who'd been vaccinated against Covid-19.  It was also resistant to the antibodies of people who'd been infected with Covid-19 early in the pandemic, including Alpha and Delta.  And BA.2 was almost completely resistant to some monoclonal antibody treatments.But there was a bright spot:  Antibodies in the blood of people who'd recently had Omicron also seemed to have some protection against BA.2, especially if they'd also been vaccinated.And that raises an important point, Fuller says.  Even though BA.2 seems more contagious and pathogenic than Omicron, it may not wind up causing a more devastating wave of Covid-19 infections.""One of the caveats that we have to think about as we get new variants that might seem more dangerous is the fact that there's two sides to the story,"" Fuller says.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.The virus matters, she says, but as its would-be hosts, so do we.""Our immune system is evolving as well. And so that's pushing back on things,"" she said.Right now, she says, we're in a race against the virus, and the key question is, who's in the lead?""What we will ultimately want is to have the host be ahead of the virus. In other words, our immunity, be a step ahead of the next variant that comes out, and I don't know that we're quite there yet,"" she said.  For that reason, Fuller says, she feels like it's not quite time for communities to lift mask mandates.""Before this thing came out, we were about 10 feet away from the finish line,"" she said. ""Taking off the masks now is not a good idea. It's just going to extend it. Let's get to the finish line."""

A total of 30 complaints of sexual harassment were made during the 2020-2021 academic year compared to 12 reports the year before, an increase of 18. The Defense Department said the reason for the increase in reports of sexual assault and harassment ""is unclear,"" because the department ""did not administer a scientific prevalence survey this year,"" the report said. Acting Director of the Sexual Assault Response Office Nate Galbreath speculated on the reasons for the increase during a media call Thursday, saying ""either that there was more crime to report or that people overall were encouraged or feel more confident in making those reports.""The report collects information from the three US military academies: the US Military Academy, the US Naval Academy and the US Air Force Academy.

The National Weather Service confirmed two tornadoes touched down about 30 miles north of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, with trees in the roadway and unspecified structural damage reported. A third tornado was reported in Pell City, east of Birmingham.In Mississippi and Tennessee reports of trees and power lines down were coming in to the US Storm Prediction Center.Central Alabama, including Birmingham, was under a tornado watch until 9 pm CT, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Rotating supercell thunderstorms in western Alabama were forecast to move into the watch area with the potential to produce tornadoes.About 25,000 customers were without power Thursday evening in Alabama, according to poweroutage.us.

They are under a flood watch as significant rainfall is likely through the day Thursday. Conditions will rapidly change to freezing rain, sleet and then snow by Thursday evening. There is even a tiny chance that the city will see severe storms before the colder air rushes in. Not everyone will experience all the impacts. Here are the conditions expected and who is likely to see them. Extreme winds and possible tornadoesDamaging winds will be the primary threat as the ongoing storms increase in intensity while they spread eastward. Over 50 million people are at risk for severe storms, from Louisiana to Virginia and more than 125 million Americans were in areas under a wind advisory. ""Damaging winds and a strong tornado or two will be possible,"" the Storm Prediction Center said. Memphis, Nashville, Murfreesboro in Tennessee, Huntsville in Alabama and Jackson in Mississippi are most likely to see damaging winds. They are all under an enhanced risk -- level 3 of 5 -- for severe storms. As of Thursday afternoon, there was a line of storms from Louisiana to Ohio. JUST WATCHEDHow to prepare for severe weatherReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow to prepare for severe weather 01:41Along with the severe weather threat are the isolated pockets of potential flooding that come with severe thunderstorms. However, there is a higher risk of flooding on the northern fringes of the warm moist air colliding with colder air.""The combination of frozen soil and melting snow will exacerbate flooding concerns throughout the Ohio Valley and Interior Northeast through tonight,"" the prediction center said.Flood watches and a slight risk -- level 2 of 4 -- of excessive rainfall reach from southern Missouri to western Vermont. Rainfall amounts around 1 to 2 inches are expected in this region, with locally higher amounts.The thing that could limit the flooding concerns will be the speed of the cold air. ""The question remains as to how much precipitation falls as which precipitation type before cold air rushes in behind a cold front,"" the prediction center said. If the cold air arrives earlier than expected, this will limit the amount of rain and reduce the likely hood of flooding.A swath of half a foot of snowOn the cold side of this system, a thin strip of heavy snow is likely to fall from northern Oklahoma to central Illinois by Thursday afternoon, forecasters said. Chicago was expecting near blizzard conditions.""Heads up! A band of particularly intense snow will move through the Chicago metro in the next few hours!"" the National Weather Service office there tweeted in a mid-afternoon update. ""Roads conditions will remain poor simply due to the high rate that snow is falling. Snow will taper from west to east throughout the evening.""

Just south of the line of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain will fall before any snow. Models show a line of freezing rain and sleet along the edge of the cold air from Missouri all the way into Ohio. It will likely be a quick transition from ice to snow but even the littlest bit of ice can make conditions more hazardous. When snow falls on top of the ice, it is more challenging to drive on and the ice also adds weight to branches and power lines. Kansas City set a daily record for February 17 with 7 inches of snow, surpassing 1893 when 6 inches fell. Other areas in the state saw as much as 10 inches.JUST WATCHEDHow freezing rain differs from sleetReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow freezing rain differs from sleet 01:04But it isn't just the Midwest.

Snow will end in the Midwest by Thursday evening and end in New England by Friday afternoon. Gusty winds cause travel hazardIf anyone has escaped the hazards of snow, severe storms and flooding, they likely won't also escape the high winds ahead of this system.Wind warnings and advisories stretch nearly 2,000 miles from Texas to Maine signifying southerly winds ahead of the storm that could become hazardous at times.

The iconic novella was penned by French author Antoine de Saint-Exupery in New York during World War II, and now 30 handwritten pages of the original manuscript are on display at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. The original manuscript sits alongside hundreds of other items that celebrate many facets of the author's life and work. They include watercolors, sketches, drawings, photographs, poems, newspaper clippings and correspondence.  The exhibit, ""An Encounter with the Little Prince,"" opened Wednesday at Paris' Museum of Decorative Arts. ""The exhibition is called 'An Encounter with the Little Prince' and the goal is to really encounter Little Prince,"" Thomas Rivière, great-grandnephew of Saint-Exupery, told CNN.  ""It's been a dream (of mine) for such a long time,"" Rivière added.Read MoreBorn in the French city of Lyon in 1900, Saint-Exupery was a writer, pilot and journalist who joined the French air force in 1940. That year, he flew to New York on a mission to persuade the United States to enter the war and fight alongside France.  While in the United States, he finished writing ""Le Petit Prince,"" which was eventually published in New York in 1943 in both English and French. Some 600 items related to ""The Little Prince"" are featured in the exhibition.The simple tale, which has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide, is about a child who travels the universe gaining wisdom. Since its initial publication, it has been translated into nearly 500 languages, according to the Museum of Decorative Arts, making it one of the most translated works in the world.The best books of 2021, according to global tastemakersSaint-Exupery, however, did not live to see that reach. He went missing while flying a mission in 1944 and was declared dead in 1945. It took Rivière, who is the head of Saint-Exupery's estate, three years to bring the exhibition to the public -- partly because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. His efforts were supported by publishers and collectors, including the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, which houses the manuscript.Photographs, poems and newspaper cuttings about the book are featured in the exhibition.Saint-Exupery wrote and drew on razor-thin paper nicknamed ""onion skin.""

Angels' official convicted in overdose death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs,"By Chuck Johnston, CNN"," (CNN)Eric Prescott Kay, a former communications director for the Los Angeles Angels, has been found guilty of two charges in the 2019 overdose death of Angels' pitcher Tyler Skaggs, the US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas said. Skaggs, 27, died on July 1, 2019, in a hotel in Southlake, Texas, before the team was set to play the Texas Rangers. Kay, 47, was found guilty Thursday of distribution of controlled substances resulting in death and conspiracy to possess with intent distribute controlled substances, according to the federal prosecutor.Prosecutors said Kay faces between 20 years and life in prison when he is sentenced in late June.CNN has reached out to attorneys for Kay.Read MoreSkaggs died by choking on vomit after using drugs and alcohol, according to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office. High levels of opioids, including fentanyl, oxycodone and oxymorphone, were found in his system, as well as alcohol, according to toxicology results. Skaggs' family said it was grateful to the federal prosecutors.""Tyler was the light of our family. He is gone, and nothing can ever bring him back,"" they said. ""We are relieved that justice was served, although today is a painful reminder of the worst day in the life of our family.""Rusty Hardin, an attorney for the Skaggs family, said the verdict is the beginning of justice served.""The trial showed Eric Kay's drug trafficking was known to numerous people in the Angels organization, and it resulted in the tragic and unnecessary death of one of their most popular players. We have no doubt that the Angels knew what Eric Kay was doing, and the team is morally and legally responsible for his conduct,"" he said, alluding to the family's lawsuits against the organization, Kay and another team official. Former Los Angeles Angels official indicted in overdose death of pitcher Tyler SkaggsAccording to court records, a search of Skaggs's phone revealed text messages from the day before his death suggesting that he had asked Kay to stop by his room with pills late that evening.The Drug Enforcement Administration's investigation found that Kay regularly dealt pills of fentanyl -- dubbed ""blue boys"" for their blue coloring -- to Skaggs and others in the Angels organization at the stadium where they worked, according to an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint. Geoffrey Lindenberg, a DEA special agent, wrote that ""but for the fentanyl"" in Skaggs's system, the medical examiner determined, the pitcher ""would not have died."" US Attorney Chad Meacham said in a statement, ""No one is immune from this deadly drug. A beloved pitcher, Tyler Skaggs was struck down in the midst of an ascendant career.

The Model 3 now has the third best ranking among EVs, behind the Mach-E and the Kia Niro.Tesla plunged seven spots to No. 23 in the overall ranking of best car brands. The drop was mainly due to the difficult-to-use yoke steering wheel the automaker recently debuted on the updated version of those models. Consumer Reports said the steering wheel was enough of a problem to lower their road-test scores.The Model 3 remains the lone Tesla model that is CR recommended. Tesla also makes the Model Y small SUV, Model X large SUV, and Model S large sedan.""Make no mistake, the Model 3 is still a great choice, and Consumer Reports recommends it,"" said its article on rankings. ""It shines with the latest technology, a long range, an impressive charging network, and a driving experience closer to a high-performance sports car than a sedan. But the Mustang Mach-E is also very sporty, plus it's more practical and easier to live with. The Ford is also quieter and rides better.""Read MoreConsumer Reports had once been among Tesla's biggest fans. It judged the Tesla Model S as the best car it ever tested when the product-testing publication first reviewed it in 2013 with a score of more than 100.But questions about reliability, based on ownership surveys, hurt the car's rankings in the not-for-profit rating services' rankings and scores for Tesla.The Mach-E has been winning critical praise elsewhere as well, including Car and Driver's first EV of the Year award last year. It actually had a slightly lower score than the Kia Niro in Consumer Reports' rankings of vehicles, but spokesperson James McQueen said the top pick in each category is based on numerous factors beyond the straight score."

Gavin Newsom on Thursday unveiled his state's plan for the ""next phase"" of the Covid-19 pandemic, which puts a specific focus on learning to live with the coronavirus.""What we're announcing here today is about turning a page,"" the Democratic governor said in a speech in San Bernardino County on Thursday. ""We have all come to understand what was not understood at the beginning of this crisis, that there is no end date, that there is not a moment where we declare victory despite so many of the metaphors that were used during this pandemic -- the war metaphors where we said, 'We will defeat this virus.'""""In that light, we have put together a plan that we coin as the 'SMARTER' plan because we are smarter two years later. We are more adaptable. We are more capable to understand the nature of this disease,"" Newsom added.The plan is an acronym for the state's seven priorities moving forward: Shots, masks, awareness, readiness, testing, education and Rx.The shift in approach comes as the Omicron wave that has slammed the United States this winter recedes -- and as other Democratic-led states move to relax restrictions. New York and Rhode Island have dropped their mask mandates in recent days; Illinois, New Jersey and Oregon are set to do so in the coming weeks.Read MoreCalifornia has long been among the most strict states in imposing Covid-19 health mandates. Newsom was the first governor to implement a statewide stay-at-home order in March 2020. But he and other Democratic governors who have imposed public health measures are adjusting their approaches as Americans willing to tolerate the risks seek a return to normalcy in some ways.With California's new plan, Newsom said, ""we move out of the pandemic phase and we move into a phase which should allow you confidence that we are not walking away. That we're taking the lessons learned and were leaning into the future.""In recent interviews, Newsom had previewed a shift in strategy to treat Covid-19 like any other virus -- including lifting the state's mandate for masks in schools. California's mask mandate for indoor businesses expired this week, though local governments can still impose their own mandates.""In that endemic plan, we will be able to answer many questions that many of you have about the world we are living in and where we are going with this virus and where can create criteria as we transition to the endemic phase,"" Newsom said last week, previewing the announcement.He said the plan will take into consideration what did and did not work in the last two years and how to address possible surges and new variants.The California governor could find himself at odds with Democratic lawmakers who control the state's legislature and are pushing for strict vaccination requirements. Proposals include one that would require vaccines for all students, except those granted medical exemptions, and allow those 12 and older to get vaccinated without their parents' consent, and one that would require businesses to require all employees and contractors to be vaccinated.As Democratic lawmakers consider going further than Newsom has, Republicans have long claimed that his mandates have gone too far -- using photos of Newsom hobnobbing maskless at a November 2020 indoor dinner party at The French Laundry restaurant to make their case.Noting that division Thursday, Newsom acknowledged, ""There are those that prefer to walk away, to deny the realities of the last few years, let the virus in all its forms and manifestations continue to take its course. That's not the approach we're arguing for. It's not the approach we're taking. We are taking a more sensible, and I would argue more sustainable health care approach based on the lessons learned to prepare for the unknown.""An attempt to recall Newsom last year, with Republican talk radio host Larry Elder emerging as the top candidate to replace him, failed in the overwhelmingly blue state. Newsom won the September recall election, with 62% of California voters saying he should not be removed from office.California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said Monday that ""California's plan, of course, will talk about data, and data elements and their importance but will largely be focused on how we stay prepared and ready and what Californians should come to expect.""""I think it's really important that we not just talk about endemic phase but how do continue to live with a virus that changes and kind of throws curveballs at different times,"" Ghaly said, noting the unpredictability of the virus. ""So, for California and our future, it is about being ready and being prepared.""This story has been updated with remarks Thursday from California Gov. Gavin Newsom."

The motion to remove the lawmakers -- which passed 66-39 -- followed an emotional appeal by Democratic state Rep. Lakesia Collins, who pleaded with the GOP lawmakers to ""do your job and comply with the rules of this House. If not, go remote. Simple.""""Every minute we waste talking to you all while you are over there whining about wearing a mask, those people are still suffering and need your help,"" she said of Illinois residents. Collins' speech touched off a fiery debate in the chamber, with GOP Rep. Andrew Chesney -- one of the lawmakers removed for not wearing a mask -- charging that Democrats were only interested in political theater and were ""not fighting for anybody.""The tense episode echoed frustrations of Democrats in Congress as Republicans continue to defy the stepped-up health protocols in the US Capitol.

Pritzker said the state -- which is seeing a fast decline in hospitalizations -- is planning to lift its statewide indoor mask requirement on February 28.""I want to be clear: Many local jurisdictions, businesses and organizations have their own mask requirements and other mitigations that must be respected,""  Pritzker, a Democrat, said in a statement this month. ""Throughout this pandemic, we've deployed the tools available to us as needed. Our approach has saved lives and kept our economy open and growing."""

The House of Representatives voted last week on a bipartisan basis to approve the measure, known as a continuing resolution or CR for short, to extend funding through March 11. Now that the Senate has passed the measure it can be sent to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law. The bill passed in the Senate by a tally of 65 to 27. Lawmakers are also working to lock in a broader full-year spending package, but have said they need more time to finish and, as a result, needed a short-term funding extension to avert a shutdown at the end of the week. In the Senate, Republican demands and Democratic absences threatened to complicate the effort to lock in a final vote and brought action down to the wire as the February 18 funding deadline neared. But leaders from both parties projected confidence there would not be a shutdown and ultimately a final vote to pass the measure went forward Thursday evening. Prior to holding a final vote on the stopgap bill, the Senate took three votes on amendments put forward by Republicans, but all three failed. Two of the amendments would have prohibited funding for vaccine mandates, while the other amendment would have imposed a balanced budget requirement. Read MoreOn Wednesday, when negotiators were trying to lock in the timing for a final vote, Democrats were already contending with several absences among their members, making the math tricky in the narrowly divided 50-50 Senate. If any amendment votes had passed, it could have jeopardized efforts to get a bill to Biden's desk before the funding expiration deadline. Democratic senator's stroke exposes fragility of 50-50 Senate majoritySen. Mark Kelly of Arizona was out on Wednesday because his wife, former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, is sick. And 88-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein missed votes Wednesday. Feinstein's husband is ill, which is why she missed votes, according to a source familiar with the situation.

One Republican senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, is away also, traveling abroad. A similar scenario -- where Republicans pushed for votes to counter vaccine mandates -- played out back in December, but the standoff ended with an agreement to hold votes on an earlier stopgap bill as well as a GOP amendment to prohibit the use of federal funding for Covid-19 vaccine mandates, which ultimately failed.The White House on Thursday said it is in ""constant communication"" with Capitol Hill on government funding.""We work closely with the Senate and with Congress, in general. And that's our path -- is to avert a government shutdown,"" principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday.Pressed on whether the White House had received any assurances that a shutdown would be avoided, she said it was ""clearly a priority for us to make sure that there is not a government shutdown.""This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.CNN's Manu Raju, Lauren Fox, Betsy Klein and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.

""The action is imminent,"" said Steve Bell, Ottawa Police Service interim chief. ""In the past few days, we have been communicating directly with the unlawful protestors. We have told them they must leave, and we have warned them the consequences of disobeying these rules.""Officers began erecting barriers and fencing throughout the capital city's downtown core Thursday in an effort to clear the area of demonstrators, according to a series of tweets from Bell. The secured area encompasses most of Ottawa's downtown and is far larger than the protest footprint to date.Protesters and supporters gather to listen to speakers on Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022, in Ottawa.""Only those with lawful reason to enter the core, such as residents, businesses, and others with lawful reasons, will be allowed in the area,"" the chief said. ""The unlawful protesters must leave the area and will not be provided access.""Bell's statement was an attempt to assure residents that the city was restoring order by removing vehicles and people that are blocking traffic.Read More""We know you have been through a lot and we are committed to returning your streets back (to) normal,"" he told residents. ""We know that the increased police presence may be distressing to some. They are here to keep you safe and complete our mission.""Fact check: Strong majority of Canadians oppose convoy protests, poll after poll findsMany demonstrators have vowed to hold out for as long as necessary, and the federal government has moved to enact emergency powers to freeze financial support of the protests despite opposition in Parliament.During a news conference, Bell was asked about a timeline for removing protesters and concerns regarding demonstrations over the weekend.""What I can tell you is this weekend will look very different from the past three weekends,"" he said. Bell maintained that authorities would like the protests to end peacefully and that they've considered ""many different circumstances that could exist within the footprint of the demonstration and in and around it, and we're actually planning for several different eventualities.""""We want people to peacefully leave,"" the chief said. ""But I can tell you that if they do not peacefully leave, we have plans, strategies and tactics to be able to get them to leave."" Beginning with a group of truckers arriving in Ottawa in late January objecting to a vaccine mandate, the protest has morphed into a general airing of grievances against all Covid-19 safety protocols. The incessant noise, shutting down of area businesses and reports of hate crimes and vandalism by protesters have exacerbated the nerves of many residents.Snow falls around a demonstrator waving a flag  outside  parliament in Ottawa on February 17, 2022.Following criticism for the prolonged situation and the recent stepping down of the chief, Ottawa police said in a statement Wednesday that anyone coming to the capital to join the protest could have their vehicles seized. A charge or conviction ""may lead to denial in crossing the USA border,"" the statement said.The Children's Aid Society of Ottawa, a nonprofit organization that gets funding from the Ontario government, is urging demonstrators to make care arrangements for their children as police move forward with ending the protest.  ""If parents and children are separated following police efforts in ending the demonstration in the downtown core, CASO will work to reunite families as soon as possible,"" the organization said in a statement.The latest moves from police come as border crossing blockades along the Canadian-US border have winded down this week. There were no delays at the Emerson checkpoint in Manitoba Thursday morning, according to the Canadian Border Services Agency's website, after the peaceful departure of protesters Wednesday ended the last remaining border disruption. No one was charged, no vehicles were towed and no injuries occurred, officials said. Conservatives object to emergency powersAs authorities work to clear demonstrations in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plan to invoke the Emergencies Act to end the protest and cut off the financial support is being criticized by opposition leadership in Parliament. Candice Bergen, interim leader of the Conservative Party, said Wednesday the party won't be supporting a motion by the federal government to use those powers, according to CNN newsgathering partner CTV.Bergen said Trudeau didn't do enough to bring an end to the demonstrations before invoking the act, CTV reported.Traveling to Canada during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go""The first act that he does when he has a chance to do something -- he doesn't go through step one, two, three -- he goes straight to 100 and invokes the Emergencies Act,"" Bergen told CTV News. ""I don't think anything that we will see will change our mind, we will be opposing it.""The act, passed in 1988 and never utilized before, can temporarily suspend citizens' rights to free movement or assembly. It can also provide for the use of the military, but Trudeau has said this would not be necessary.Trudeau defended his decision to invoke the Emergencies Act during an address to Parliament on Thursday. ""We did it to protect families and small businesses. To protect jobs and the economy. We did it because the situation could not be dealt with under any other law in Canada,"" Trudeau said. ""For the good of all Canadians, the illegal blockades and occupations have to stop, and the borders have to remain open."" The Prime Minister told Parliament that about half of the funding for the demonstrations is being supported by people in the United States. ""These illegal blockades are being heavily supported by individuals in the United States and from elsewhere around the world,"" he said. ""We see that roughly half of the funding that is flowing to the barricaders here is coming from the United States. The goal of all measures, including financial measures in the Emergencies Act, is to deal with the current threat only and to get the situation fully under control."" To invoke powers under the Emergencies Act, the government must propose a motion in the House and Senate explaining why federal officials need the powers and specifying what actions will be taken, then both the House and Senate must confirm the motions, according to CTV.Debate on the House motion was to begin Thursday and a vote will be held soon, said Government House Leader Mark Holland, a member of Trudeau's Liberal Party.Trudeau said invoking the act ""is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting peoples' jobs and restoring faith in our institutions.""Trucks parked on Wellington Street, in front of Parliament Hill, during a demonstration in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday.4 charged with conspiracy to commit murder at Alberta protestWhile the Ottawa shutdown is ongoing and the Manitoba blockade dissolved without confrontation, authorities who ended other border demonstrations earlier this week were met with some resistance.Police in Ontario announced the arrest of up to 30 protesters while clearing out a blockade Sunday in Windsor, near the Ambassador Bridge, a critical link for US and Canadian commerce that connects to Detroit.

But the images of a shelled kindergarten in eastern Ukraine shifted international focus to the Donbas region, where the world braced itself for signs that the simmering conflict there might escalate very seriously and catastrophically.    Thankfully, the shell that hit the Stanytsia Luhanska school took no lives. But they were a reminder of the very real stakes for people living near the Line of Contact that separates Ukrainian government forces from Russian-backed separatists.   For weeks, world leaders have been shuttling back and forth to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and making high-level phone calls to try to put the brakes on a confrontation between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis.   Yet in Moscow today, there's been no signs of a breakthrough, but a clear ratcheting up of tension. On Thursday afternoon local time, US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan paid a visit to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he received a long-awaited response from the Russian government to a written document delivered to Russia three weeks earlier.  Is Putin creating a pretext for war? The document made clear that the Russians laid full blame on the US and its allies for stoking the Ukraine crisis, even as evidence continues to mount of that as many as 150,000 Russian troops are arrayed around Ukraine's borders.   Read More""There is no plan for a 'Russian invasion' of Ukraine, as the U.S. and its allies have been alleging at the official level since last Autumn,"" the document, released by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti said. ""Therefore, claims about 'Russian culpability for the escalation' cannot be interpreted as anything other than an attempt to pressure and devalue Russian offers of security guarantees.""  At about the same time, the US State Department confirmed Russia had expelled the second-most senior diplomat at the US diplomatic mission in Moscow, a move that US President Joe Biden's administration called an ""escalatory"" step.That escalation has clearly been incremental: A senior State Department official said that Bart Gorman, the US deputy chief of mission in Moscow was formally expelled by Moscow earlier this year, given two weeks to depart and left Moscow last week.   So where does that leave diplomacy? It's still not entirely dead. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Thursday with his Italian counterpart, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Lavrov essentially laid out the same complaint that was in the written reply delivered to the US: The Americans and NATO have ignored Russia's core security concerns, he said, and none of the secondary issues  -- on the technical details of arms control, for instance  --  can be resolved ""until we agree on our key positions.""   And on those key positions, particularly regarding the issue of who can join NATO, Russia and the West remain very, very far apart.   "

""In addition to stopping removals to regions such as Haiti that face serious insecurity, we also urge you to take steps to address the systemic challenges Black migrants face to receiving equal treatment.""Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey led the initiative, joining 13 of their colleagues in the Senate, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and 88 House members in signing the letter.The lawmakers cited images from September of US Border Patrol agents on horseback swinging long reins near Haitian migrants who had crossed the border near Del Rio, Texas. They argued that due to politics, climate and its economy, Haiti ""cannot safely accept the repatriation of its nationals.""The letter also underscored recent frustrations with the Biden administration over the Title 42 public health order, which was invoked by the Trump administration at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and has continued to be used by the Biden administration. Title 42 was recently extended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the lawmakers alleged that the policy deprives ""legitimate asylum seekers the opportunity to pursue their claims.""Read MoreCNN has reached out to the White House and CDC for a comment.Immigration advocates have urged the White House to rescind the order to no avail, arguing that it has no health basis and puts migrants in harm's way.""The Title 42 order has no basis in public health and the CDC is allowing itself to be used to justify mass expulsions of asylum seekers in violation of US and international refugee law to harm's way,"" Robyn Barnard, a senior advocacy counsel at Human Rights First, previously told CNN. ""This policy of expelling asylum seekers is a stain on US history and it is now part of the President and Vice President's legacy.""The lawmakers suggest a review of the treatment of Black migrants within the US immigration system as a ""starting point,"" citing a ""long history of inhumane treatment."" The letter pointed to a report from the Black Alliance for Just Immigration and New York University School of Law's Immigrants' Rights Clinic that found that although Black immigrants comprise 5.4% of the unauthorized population in the US, and 7.2% of the total non-citizen population, they made up 10.6% of all immigrants in removal proceedings between 2003 and 2015.""Unfortunately, Black migrants continue to face disparate and often inhumane treatment at every stage of the immigration enforcement process,"" the lawmakers wrote.

Alexander Kueng laughed at a joke made by Derek Chauvin while restraining George Floyd, according to testimony Thursday.Citing body camera video transcripts, Assistant US Attorney Manda Sertich asked Kueng during cross-examination what he was laughing at on video. Kueng told the jury that a few days earlier, he and Chauvin had responded to an incident at a hospital involving a patient who was restrained and yelling that he could not breathe.After a nurse had said, ""it takes a lot of oxygen,"" Chauvin said that he would use that line. Kueng referred to it as ""a brief moment of levity.""A courtroom sketch of J. Alexander Kueng testifying on February 17, 2022.

The data was from before Trump took office, yet Trump and several right-wing commentators, including on Fox News and Republican politicians, said Durham found evidence of spying and hacking Trump.Unspooling the latest twists in special counsel John Durham's investigation ""If third parties or members of the media have overstated, understated, or otherwise misinterpreted facts contained in the Government's Motion, that does not in any way undermine the valid reasons for the Government's inclusion of this information,"" Durham's team wrote in a court filing Thursday.""Defense counsel has presumed the Government's bad faith and asserts that the Special Counsel's Office intentionally sought to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool. That is simply not true,"" Durham added.Durham's filing came after Sussmann described Durham's investigation as ""prosecutorial overreach"" in a court filing on Thursday, seeking to have his charge thrown out.Read MoreDurham has charged Sussmann with lying to then-FBI General Counsel James Baker about representing Hillary Clinton and a tech company. In the meeting with Baker, Sussmann shared suspicious computer data that seemed to suggest Trump and his associates had contact with a Russian bank.Sussmann, formerly a lawyer with the Democratic Party-tied law firm Perkins Coie, has maintained that he didn't lie to Baker about who he represented. Thursday, Sussmann argued that ultimately didn't matter to the FBI's Russia investigation, which at the time was in its infancy.""He met with the FBI, in other words, to provide a tip. There is no allegation in the indictment that the tip he provided was false. And there is no allegation that he believed that the tip he provided was false,"" Sussmann's legal team wrote.Durham has been investigating the origins of the FBI's probe into supposed ties between Trump and Russia, which eventually netted several convictions of top Trump advisers. But no one was charged with a conspiracy with Russia, and when the FBI investigated suspicions of a Trump Organization-Russia connection, it found ""insufficient evidence"" of a secret communications channel, prosecutors said.Trump and his children may be deposed by New York attorney general, judge rulesEarlier this week, Sussmann pushed back against Durham after the special counsel insinuated that he and the tech company he represented also misled the CIA about the use of Russian phones around Trump, in a vague court filing last Friday. Sussmann and the tech executive he worked with, Rodney Joffe, say they did not aim to manipulate federal officials out of political animus, and that Durham's suggestions, which quickly took off in right-wing media, were wrong.Sussmann argued some of the details were wrong, and shouldn't have been included in court filings in the first place because they were not a central part of the case. Durham had included the details in an argument about possible conflicts of interest for Sussmann's lawyers as he heads to trial.Sussmann is scheduled to have a trial in May. But first, the federal judge overseeing the case, Christopher ""Casey"" Cooper of the DC District Court, must decide whether the prosecutors' case is legally sound enough to move forward. Sussmann's team says Durham's approach to the case could harm free speech, ""dissuade honest citizens from coming forward with tips, and chill the advocacy of lawyers who interact with the government,"" according to his filing."

""I am here today not to start a war, but to prevent one,"" Blinken said. The United States says evidence at Ukraine's border shows that Russia is ""moving towards an imminent invasion"" and is not withdrawing troops, despite Moscow's claims. The comments from Blinken and other top US officials Thursday -- including President Joe Biden's blunt warning that he believed an attack would happen ""within the next several days"" -- marked an even greater sense of urgency from the Biden administration that Russia's actions indicated the Kremlin was moving forward with plans for war. ""Every indication that we have is that they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine,"" Biden told reporters as he left the White House on Thursday.Read MoreBiden: 'Every indication' is that Russia will attack Ukraine 'within the next several days'Russia once again dismissed the notion it was preparing to attack Ukraine as ""baseless accusations."" In his address to the Security Council, Blinken laid out several steps the US expected Russia to take in the coming days in an attempt to justify military action in Ukraine. He said Moscow was likely to try to generate a pretext for the war, which could be a fabricated terrorist bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery of a mass grave or a staged drone strike. ""Russia may describe this event as ethnic cleansing or a genocide, making a mockery of a concept that we in this chamber do not take lightly,"" Blinken said.Blinken said that top Russian officials were likely to hold urgent meetings before an attack that would include Russian bombings across Ukraine and cyberattacks. Blinken said the US believes Moscow has already selected targets that Russian tanks and troops would advance on, including Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.Blinken acknowledged ""that some have called into question our information,"" nodding to past problems with US intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq War. But he said the US would be relieved if it's predictions are proven incorrect and Russia changes course.""The information I presented here is validated by what we've seen unfolding in plain sight before our eyes for months,"" Blinken said. ""Remember that while Russia has repeatedly regarded our warnings as melodrama and nonsense, they've been steadily amassing more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders.""Russia accuses US of making 'baseless accusations'Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey Vershinin, who spoke before Blinken at Thursday's Security Council meeting, warned others about making the UN meeting a ""circus,"" saying they should not present ""baseless accusations saying that Russia allegedly was going to attack Ukraine.""""We have long ago clarified everything and explained everything. And the announced date of this so-called invasion is behind us, so therefore ... my advice to you is [to] not present yourself in an awkward situation,"" Vershinin said.On Thursday, the US received a response from Russia to the written proposals the US submitted to Russia three weeks ago, a senior State Department official said. In an 11-page document published by state news agency RIA-Novosti, Moscow said the US did not provide a constructive response and that ""the increasing US and NATO military activity close to Russian borders is alarming."" ""It's about giving up the further expansion of NATO,"" the response said.As tensions continued to ratchet up, the State Department said Thursday that Russia expelled the second-most senior diplomat at the US embassy in Moscow without any justification, in what the Biden administration views as an escalatory move.  Gorman departed Moscow last week, according to a senior State Department official. He was expelled by Moscow earlier this year and given two weeks to depart. ""Russia's actions against our deputy chief of mission, who was a key member of the embassy's leadership team, was unprovoked,"" White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""Now more than ever, it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments.""addressing the UN because ""this is a crucial moment.""US says Moscow has expelled deputy chief of mission at US embassy Moscow in 'escalatory' move""The evidence on the ground is that Russia is moving towards an imminent invasion,"" she said. ""Our goal is to convey the gravity of the situation,"" she said.Blinken said that he proposed in a letter a meeting next week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Europe to continue diplomacy, along with meetings of the NATO-Russia council and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.US says Russian still adding troops and capabilities on Ukraine's borderUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Thursday also said the US government is not seeing any kind of withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's border, instead seeing Russia adding to its capabilities and troops ""even in the last couple of days.""During a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Austin said the US is seeing Russia move some troops closer to the border, fly in more combat and support aircraft, stock up on blood supplies and ""sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea.""""I was a soldier myself not that long ago, and I know firsthand that you don't do these sort of things for no reason, and you certainly don't do them if you're getting ready to pack up and go home, so we and our allies will stay vigilant,"" he said Thursday.Russia has rockets and artillery arrayed in a way that can target cities and other concentrated population areas, according to a US official.The US has been flying aerial surveillance over Ukraine for some time now, using a combination of RC-135 Rivet Joints and RQ-4 Global Hawks, as part of its intelligence gathering efforts. Those flights have continued, even as concerns of an invasion have grown.Echoing comments from Biden and other administrations officials, the US official said the Russians have everything in place to conduct a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, far more than is needed if the goal was only to target the Ukrainian military.The official did not say Putin has made a final decision to invade and noted he could call troops back any time he wants, but warned, ""Everything we see speaks to intent."" In trying to figure out Putin's next move, the US is looking at the total environment in eastern Europe -- from renewed fighting in Donbas to the false flag operations to the Russian disinformation campaign -- and comparing that to the latest intelligence to connect those elements as a possible pretext for an invasion. But it is imprecise work and not possible to draw out an absolute conclusion about whether or when Putin will move in. Still, there is growing confidence in Putin's eventual move. The official said the US is seeing preparations that already show the ""intentions to do military operations.""In eastern Ukraine, monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported a sharp escalation in ceasefire violations along the frontlines dividing Ukrainian and separatist forces. Both Ukrainian armed forces and separatists controlling parts of eastern Ukraine spoke of renewed shelling in the region early Thursday. Video and images confirmed by CNN show that a kindergarten in Ukrainian-controlled territory was hit by a shell Thursday.In a statement on Twitter, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said the village of Stanytsia Luhanska ""was shelled with heavy weapons from the occupied territory of the Donbas. Kuleba accused Russian-backed separatists of using a tank to carry out artillery fire in eastern Ukraine. Speaking alongside his British counterpart, Liz Truss, the Ukrainian foreign minister accused Russia of spreading disinformation to blame Ukraine. ""These shells came from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, which are controlled by Russia,"" Kuleba said in Kyiv. Top officials gather in MunichNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier Thursday that NATO allies are concerned that Russia is attempting to ""stage a pretext"" for an armed attack against Ukraine.He added that NATO has observed ""false flag operations"" in Ukraine by Russian intelligence officers to ""provide an excuse for invading Ukraine.""""We don't know what will happen, but what we do know is that Russia has amassed the biggest force we have seen for decades in and around Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said.Amid the tension between Russia and the West, US, NATO and European officials are converging in Munich for an annual conference to address global security issues. Russia is not planning to attend. Vice President Kamala Harris is leading the US delegation that includes Blinken to the Munich Security Conference, and plans to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Stoltenberg during the trip.Austin has also been traveling this week, meeting with other defense ministers of NATO to discuss Russia's military buildup, before he heads to Poland and Lithuania to meet with the country's leaders and US troops.This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.CNN's Jennifer Hansler, Barbara Starr, Oren Liebermann, Michael Conte, Christian Sierra, Tim Lister, Nathan Hodge, Uliana Pavlova, Katie Polglase, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Anastasia Graham-Yooll contributed to this report."

The 15-year-old left the ice in tears upon the end of her routine, as she received loud applause from those in the stands, and was consoled afterwards as the emotions from the past few days appeared to catch up with her.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had previously said no medal or flower ceremony for the winners would be held should Valieva finish in the top three.

Valieva has sought to blame the positive test on contamination from medication taken by her grandfather, an IOC official familiar with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing which cleared Valieva for the rest of the Games said on Tuesday.""Her argument was that this contamination happened with a product her grandfather was taking,"" Denis Oswald, the chair of the IOC Disciplinary Commission said, while clarifying that he was not present at the CAS hearing. Valieva's positive test for trimetazidine, though taken in December, was only analyzed and reported to Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) in February, resulting in Valieva's suspension on February 8 -- a day after she helped propel the ROC to a gold-medal finish in the figure skating team event.But the skater was reinstated after an appeal, and CAS on Monday allowed her to compete in the Olympics, citing specific provisions related to her protected status as minor, while investigations into any doping violations by Valieva and the adults responsible for her training continue.Valieva falls during her free skating routing on February 17, 2022.Oswald also reiterated the IOC's intention to investigate Valieva's entourage, which would include her coach Eteri Tutberidze, who is known for her extreme training techniques. ""It is clearly a wish and a decision of the IOC but also WADA to examine all aspects of this case including the situation of the entourage because, of course, you can imagine a girl of 15 would not do something wrong alone -- so yes, the entourage will be investigated,"" Oswald told reporters. CAS has not responded to CNN's request for comment regarding Oswald's quotes.An emotional Valieva finished first after the short program of the women's singles competition on Tuesday.IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said Wednesday that any result involving the 15-year-old in the women's individual event would carry an ""asterisk"" until her case has been concluded.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosIn a statement released on the ROC's website, the president of the ROC, Stanislav Pozdnyakov, said the organization ""categorically"" disagreed with the IOC's position that the results should be considered ""preliminary.""The head of the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) Travis Tygart said about Valieva in a statement: ""On the one hand, my heart breaks for her because of the despicable acts of the adults in her life and the catastrophic failures of the Russian and IOC-run systems that permanently cast a dark cloud over her performances.

This is redemption.""(Left to right) Sarah Fillier, Jill Saulnier, Renata Fast and Melodie Daoust celebrate with their gold medals after beating Team USA.Ticking downNot that they needed the extra motivation, but Canada women's ice hockey general manager Gina Kingsbury had an innovative way to help her players build up to the 2022 Winter Games. Kingsbury, a two-time Olympic champion as a player, gave each member of the Canadian women's team a clock which counted down the days and hours to the Beijing 2022 Opening Ceremony after Canada finished third in the 2019 World Championships. The clock's purpose was to focus the Canadian players, and it came particularly in handy during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We had a team slogan that was called 'Impact the Red,'"" Canada's Natalie Spooner said. ""Obviously, we couldn't be together as a team every single day, but it was impacting those days when we weren't able to be together, making sure we were improving as individuals and as a team also.""We were looking at that clock all the time. We had it in our houses, and even through Covid, we obviously weren't able to be together for a lot of that time.""So we had that clock there to make sure we did our own work on those off days to make sure we were ready when we came back as a team.""It (the clock) had how many days, hours, minutes, seconds until the Opening Ceremony on it.""Canada's players rush onto the ice in celebration after beating Team USA in the women's ice hockey gold medal match.Each player kept their clock in their own unique locations -- Spooner says she kept hers in the kitchen -- and Poulin says she'll display the clock alongside her gold medal from Beijing. And the Canadian players aren't ruling out resetting the clock for Cortina in 2026. Spooner said: ""The clock is at zero now, but if they re-start the clock for the next four years then maybe (she will put it next to the gold medal).""""Might as well,"" Poulin said when asked whether she will reset it.'Pretty numb'For defending champion Team USA, it was a painful end to its Olympics campaign. The team showed grit and determination to fight its way back into the final, but came up just short in its search for what would be a game-tying goal. US goaltender Alex Cavallini says she felt ""pretty numb"" in the aftermath of the defeat. But for her personally, it was also a ""pretty special"" moment because of the injuries she was battling through. ""I actually tore my MCL (in mid-January 2022) and didn't even know if I was going to make it on the flight here,"" Cavallini explained. ""I didn't have a full practice until three days into when we got here. Our third practice in was when I actually practiced. Didn't know if I was going to get a start or not.""For me to be able to battle it out, thanks to our amazing staff and coaching staff to believe in me even when I didn't and support me along the way -- that was a huge deal for me to even get minutes here.""Alex Carpenter, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Amanda Kessel line up for their silver medals after the women's ice hockey gold medal match.It was a campaign fraught with adversity for Team USA, having lost star player Brianna Decker to a broken leg in the first game.Decker's US teammate, Lee Stecklein, helped push her onto the ice on her scooter to receiver her silver medal.

Valieva declared both of these on a doping control form, according to a court application allegedly filed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in a case raised after it came to light that Valieva tested positive for a banned substance in December.Kamila Valieva of Team ROC skates during the women's singles competition on Tuesday in Beijing.The London-based Dossier Center, an investigative website run by an exiled Russian businessman, published part of the WADA court application online and it was reviewed for CNN by Travis Tygart, head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). The Dossier Center did not publish the doping control form or the test report exhibited in the case, and CNN has not reviewed them.Russian skater Kamila Valieva breaks into tears after taking to ice for first time since controversial doping scandal rulingCNN has reached out to the CAS and the parties involved in Valieva's arbitration hearing to confirm the validity of the court application published by the Dossier Center and has yet to hear back. CNN has also reached out to the WADA accredited lab in Sweden which tested Valieva's sample from December for comment. Tygart, who is not involved in the investigation into the Russian skater, described the application published by the Dossier Center as ""accurate and legitimate."" The 15-year-old skater has been in the spotlight since it emerged days into the Olympics that she tested positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine, which experts say can enhance endurance. Valieva has sought to blame the positive test on contamination from medication taken by her grandfather, an IOC official familiar with the CAS hearing said on Tuesday.Read MoreThe presence of the additional substances raises further questions about the skater's drug use, according to Tygart. USADA tried to ban Hypoxen in 2017 due to its performance-enhancing capabilities, but that ban was not implemented, Tygart told CNN. ""It raises a whole host of questions that have yet to be determined and what appears to be the case of a pretty deliberate attempt to use substances in order to enhance performance,"" Tygart said.""The picture it paints is, you've got a ​15-year-old. Does she have the wherewithal and the knowledge and the financial resources to find and use two drugs, one of which is prohibited TMZ (Trimetazidine) and another one Hypoxen, [along with] L-carnitine (a supplement) -- to increase endurance and reduce fatigue?,"" he said.According to the application published by the Dossier Center, Valieva's mother testified in a provisional hearing that the athlete took one of the substances, Hypoxen, ""to treat 'heart variations.'""Supradyn, which can be used as an immunity boosting supplement, was also listed on Valieva's doping control form, according to the application.ROC at Beijing 2022: What is it and how can Russian athletes compete at the Olympics?Valieva's positive test for trimetazidine, though taken in December, was only analyzed and reported to Russia's anti-doping agency in February, resulting in Valieva's suspension on February 8 -- a day after she helped propel the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to a gold-medal finish in the figure skating team event. But the skater was reinstated after an appeal, and the CAS on Monday allowed her to compete in the Olympics, citing specific provisions related to her protected status as minor, while investigations into any doping violations by Valieva and the adults responsible for her training continue. An emotional Valieva came out at the top after the short program of the women's singles competition on Tuesday. She will compete in the second portion of the event -- where she is the favorite for gold -- on Thursday. Russian athletes competing at the Olympics are already under the shadow of a history of illegal doping: WADA barred Russia from international competitions in 2019 over doping violations. Under the ban set to expire later this year, they've only been able to participate as neutrals in the Games."

""We had not a brilliant day, but a good enough day to be the deserved winner.""Mo Salah might be the best Premier League player ever but is the 'unprecedented' Liverpool forward still underrated?'We needed to be ready to suffer'A high-tempo opening to the game saw Liverpool start quickly, with Mane -- newly crowned Africa Cup of Nations hero with Senegal -- squandering two of the visitors' best early chances.Inter were inches away from taking the lead when Ivan Perisic's low cross found Hakan Çalhanoğlu, the Turkish midfielder crashing a thunderous strike off the underside of Alisson's crossbar.Mane went close with an audacious acrobatic effort in the first half.With Perisic spearheading a surging start to the second-half for Inter, Klopp rung the changes. A triple substitution just before the hour-mark saw Elliot, Fabinho and Mane depart with Naby Keita, Jordan Henderson and new-signing Diaz enter. But it was the half-time substitute, Firmino, who made the breakthrough, the Brazilian darting across Alessandro Bastoni to superbly head an Andy Robertson corner across goalkeeper Samir Handanovic and just inside the far post.The goal had come against the run of play, yet within 10 minutes Liverpool had doubled their lead. Salah reacted fastest to captain Virgil van Dijk's nod down to rattle -- via a deflection -- a shot past a helpless Handanovic.It was Salah's eighth goal in seven Champions League matches this season.Perisic (L) proved a constant threat down Inter's left side.Having seen out the closing stages, Van Dijk said that Inter's dominance during periods of the game hadn't come as a surprise to Liverpool""Everyone expected to be under pressure, because they are a very good team and it is the Champions League,"" Van Dijk told BT Sport.""We needed to be ready to suffer and do the hard work, and we definitely did. Happy days.""Bayern woes continueIn Wednesday's other Champions League fixture, Kingsley Coman spared Bayern Munich's blushes as a disappointing week for the German club continued with a 1-1 draw against Red Bull Salzburg in Austria. Chikwubuike Adamu celebrates scoring the opening goal.Still reeling from Saturday's stunning 4-2 defeat to Vfl Bochum in the Bundesliga -- wherein they are pursuing a tenth straight title -- Bayern fell behind to Chukwubuike Adamu's first-half strike.

Lynch, who was the first Black female attorney general in US history, will defend the NFL in the racial discrimination lawsuit filed by Flores earlier this month, along with Brad Karp of the Paul, Weiss firm, according to NFL vice president of communications Brian McCarthy. Lynch joined the firm, which also represented the league on concussion issues, in 2019. Lynch led an independent investigation into Syracuse University's Department of Public Safety in the wake of student protests in 2020 over the university's handling of racist incidents on campus.When asked about the NFL hiring Lynch, the legal team representing Flores did not comment.The Dolphins fired Flores in January, and the team announced Mike McDaniel as their next head coach earlier this month. Flores was 24-25 in his three years with the Dolphins, including a 9-8 record this past season when Miami missed qualifying for the playoffs.Read MoreIn his lawsuit against the NFL and three teams -- the Dolphins, Denver Broncos and New York Giants -- Flores alleges that after the regular season, the Giants interviewed him for their vacant head coaching job under disingenuous circumstances, claiming he had found out three days before his interview that the Giants had already decided to hire Brian Daboll.

Ultimately, we hired the individual we felt was most qualified to be our next head coach.""Flores alleges in his lawsuit that his interview with the Giants was a ruse so the team could ""demonstrate falsely to League Commissioner Roger Goodell and the public at large that it was in compliance with the Rooney Rule.""The NFL instituted the Rooney Rule in 2003 in an effort to increase diversity among the NFL's head coaching, general manager and executive ranks. The rule requires every team to interview at least two external minority candidates for open head coaching positions, according to the NFL's Football Operations website.As of Wednesday, there are only two Black head coaches in the NFL -- Pittsburgh Steelers' Mike Tomlin and Houston Texans' Lovie Smith -- in a league where nearly 70% of the players are Black.JUST WATCHEDEx-NFL coach speaks out about 'humiliating' Bill Belichick textReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEx-NFL coach speaks out about 'humiliating' Bill Belichick text 02:57Three other head coaches of color lead their teams: Washington Commanders' Ron Rivera, who is of Puerto Rican and Mexican descent, New York Jets' Robert Saleh, who is of Lebanese descent, and McDaniel, who is multiracial.Following the announcement of the lawsuit in February, the NFL issued a statement calling Flores' allegations meritless.""The NFL and our clubs are deeply committed to ensuring equitable employment practices and continue to make progress in providing equitable opportunities throughout our organizations,"" the league said in its statement.

""For Brian to make an assumption about my appearance and state of mind early that morning was subjective, hurtful and just plain wrong.

sport,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/sport/womens-figure-skating-scoring-explainer/index.html,Here's how women's figure skating is now scored (and why stamina often leads to more points),"By Holly Yan, CNN"," (CNN)Gone are the days when Olympic figure skating was scored solely at the judges' discretion, with subjective points awarded on a 6.0 scale.A 2002 Olympic figure skating scandal -- with allegations of score-fixing -- upended the sport and led to a complete overhaul of the scoring system -- one that awards more points for stamina and strenuous athletic feats. Now, another Olympic skating controversy has gripped die-hard and casual fans alike. Kamila Valieva, 15, gave a test sample that later tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine on December 25, the day she won the Russian national championship.Russian skating star Kamila Valieva cleared to skate at Beijing GamesTrimetazidine is a medication that can increase stamina and make ""your heart work more efficiently,"" said  Dr. Elizabeth Murray, pediatric emergency medicine physician at the University of Rochester Medical Center.Read MoreBut the positive result wasn't announced by the World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited Swedish lab until February 8, a day after Valieva and her Russian Olympic Committee teammates won gold in the team competition. An Olympic official said Valieva blamed the positive test on a mix-up with her grandfather's medication. The skater's coach, Eteri Tutberidze, told Russian state news agency Tass her entourage is ""absolutely sure"" she is innocent.As the investigation continues, Valieva was allowed to compete in the Olympic women's individual figure skating event. Here's how the sport has evolved in recent years to reward increased athleticism and stamina: More difficult jumps = more pointsIn 2004, the International Skating Union ditched the subjective ""6.0"" scoring system for the more rubric-based International Judging System that gives certain base points for jumps depending on their degree of difficulty and how many times the skater rotates in the air.Kamila Valieva competes for the first time since a controversial doping scandal rulingFor example, a quadruple Lutz -- in which a skater makes four revolutions in the air -- carries more base points than a triple Lutz. But a triple Lutz carries more base points than less difficult triples, such as a triple loop or a triple Salchow. After each jump, skaters can gain or lose points from the base value depending on the grade of execution -- how well or poorly they executed the jump.All those numbers are part of the technical score. There's also the presentation score, which rewards artistry and skating skills between jumps. But in recent years, skaters have been able to win competitions largely due to points racked up from jumping -- with quadruple jumps playing a larger role in men's and women's skating. Why better stamina can win skaters more pointsIn women's figure skating, athletes perform two routines: the short program, which is about 2 minutes and 40 seconds long, and the free skate, which is about 4 minutes long. Russian skater Alina Zagitova was 15 when she won Olympic gold after performing all her free skate jumps in the second half of the routine.With the current scoring system, jumps performed in the second half of the free skate can get a 10% bonus because it's more difficult to perform them on tired legs. 2018 Olympic champion Alina Zagitova, who was also coached by Tutberidze, capitalized on this and put all her triple jumps in the second half of her free skate. The 15-year-old Russian won Olympic gold and was celebrated by President Vladimir Putin. Russian President Vladimir Putin presents Alina Zagitova with an Order of Friendship following the Russian teen's Olympic win in 2018.But critics denounced Zagitova's method of winning, saying the teen's performance lacked artistry or relied too heavily on jumps crammed in the second half of the routine to maximize points. After the widespread criticism in 2018, the International Skating Union created a new rule saying skaters will only get 10% bonuses for up to three jumping passes in the second half of their free skate. The new rule has been dubbed the ""Zagitova rule."" Even if Kamila Valieva wins, she losesSince the last Olympics, women's figure skating has been dominated by Russian teenagers such as Kamila Valieva, Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova.All three have won international championships after adding quadruple jumps in their routines -- an enormous athletic feat.Valieva became the first individual female skater to land a quad at the Olympics when she helped Russian skaters win the team event last week. But she might not get that team Olympic gold medal around her neck for a while -- if at all.  The International Olympic Committee's executive board said this week that there would be no medal ceremony for the team event until it's determined whether Valieva had violated anti-doping regulations.CNN's Simone McCarthy, Hannah Ritchie and George Ramsay contributed to this report.

sport,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/sport/olympics-figure-skating-questions-cec/index.html,Why Olympic figure skaters don't get dizzy ,"By Faith Karimi, CNN"," (CNN)Top figure skaters spin at such unbelievably fast speeds -- as many as six revolutions per second -- that it can make even spectators feel a little woozy. Curious viewers of the Beijing Winter Olympics want to know why. ""How do figure skaters not get dizzy?"" has been one of the top Google searches over the past week.So how do these athletes pull off such head-spinning moves without toppling over?As skating events continue in Beijing this week -- the women's free skate program airs Thursday night on NBC and Peacock -- we turned to experts for answers.  Do figure skaters get dizzy?Read MoreNot so much, because they've learned how to minimize it.Although they occasionally tumble upon landing, figure skaters mostly spin through the air without losing their balance. That's because they have conditioned their bodies and brains to quash that dizzying feeling, experts say. American figure skater Mirai Nagasu, who won a bronze medal at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018, says she feels the rotations but has learned how to recenter her focus over the years. ""I think we have a learned ability against the momentum that hits us while we're spinning,"" she says.US Olympic medalist Mirai Nagasu  skates at Bryant Park in New York City.Kathleen Cullen, a professor of biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University, has a more scientific answer. She studies the vestibular system, which is responsible for our sense of balance and motion, and says spinning without stumbling from dizziness is an art perfected over time. At the start of their careers, skaters and other athletes feel dizzy when they spin around, Cullen says. But ultimately, they train their brains to better interpret that feeling. ""There's a really profound fundamental thing that happens in the brain of people like dancers or skaters over lots and lots of practice. And that's basically a change in the way the brain is processing information,"" Cullen says. ""When you spin around, you're activating the semicircular canals, rotation sensors. They're filled with fluid and they're sensing your rotation. But when you stop, the fluid has inertia and it tends to continue to move. They actually get a false sensation of movement.""Over years of training, figure skaters' brains have adapted and learned to ignore this error, she says.""This is done over time with each practice session, day by day, as the brain compares its expectations with what it is actually pulling in from its sensory receptors.""Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue of Team USA skate on day 10 of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games on February 14, 2022.In short, Cullen says, most people feel like the world's still whirling even after they stop spinning. But Olympians, and skaters in particular, generally do not because their brains have changed to suppress the feeling. Athletes also learn ways to reduce their dizziness. For example, focusing on a fixed reference or stationary object minimizes dizziness and loss of balance. ""Ballet dancers often whip their head around during each turn to fixate a visual reference. Similarly, at the end of the spin, athletes will fixate their eyes at a specific spot on the wall to provide a fixed reference,"" Cullen says. Figure skater Zhu Yi of China competes in the women's short program at the 2022 Winter Olympics.The brain and the inner ear are in constant communication with the body and one another to achieve balance, says Brigid Dwyer, an assistant professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine. ""For most people, however, dizziness is only a potential issue during faster and more forceful activities,"" Dwyer says. ""Amazingly, when needed, our brains can be prompted over time to better handle the dizzying tasks we encounter.""Here are some other common Google search queries about figure skating:Why do some figure skaters wear tights over their boots?Nagasu says it all comes down to personal choice. Some people wear tights over their boots if their boots are scuffed up, she says. Others, like Courtney Hicks, a gold medalist at the 2013 US International Figure Skating Classic, say wearing tights over boots helps elongate the look of their legs.  But trends have changed in recent years, with a lot of skaters opting to wear tights that show off their boots, Nagasu says. Courtney Hicks of the US performs during a women's singles free skating event in Nagano, Japan, in November 2015.       What's the 'kiss and cry' area?After their program, figure skaters wait for their scores at the aptly named ""kiss and cry"" rinkside area. Here, spectators get a glimpse of the athletes at one of their most tense moments. Many figure skaters celebrate with kisses with their coaches -- although not so much in the pandemic, as they are often masked -- or dissolve into tears of disappointment.""It's supposed to be a pun. You either give kisses over how happy your score is or it's so bad you literally cry,"" Nagasu says.  Kaori Sakamoto of Team Japan reacts after hearing her score during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Why do some figure skaters wear gloves?Skaters can easily take a tumble. And slapping the ice at high velocity is no fun. ""Ice can be rough when you're falling, especially when you're factoring the height at which we fall from and the momentum from our rotations,"" Nagasu says.  Gloves also keep the skaters' hands warm during the competition. In a highly competitive sport where the tiniest advantage can make a difference, many athletes are leaving nothing to chance."

Jamaica's flag bearers Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian (L) and Benjamin Alexander enter the stadium leading Jamaica's delegation during the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, at the National Stadium, known as the Bird's Nest, in Beijing, on February 4, 2022.A few months later, in February of 2016, Alexander had his first lesson in Whistler and ""it's just been kind of a steady progression since,"" he says modestly.Initially, Alexander wanted to get good enough at skiing to keep up with his friends.The youngest and oldest Winter Olympians competing at Beijing 2022 ""As I got good enough to kind of keep up with them socially, being the only black representative in the group but on top of that being of Jamaican heritage, people kept throwing sideways jokes about 'Cool Runnings,'"" added Alexander, referring to the 1993 hit film about the unlikely story of the Jamaican four-man bobsleigh team's bid to get to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary, Alexander went to the PyeongChang Games in 2018 as a spectator, and started to wonder if he could compete at that level.""One of the things I noticed, other than thoroughly enjoying the spirit of the Olympics, was that there were only three Jamaican athletes in attendance. ""It took me aback knowing how strong Jamaica is in the Summer Games, knowing how popular that movie 'Cool Runnings' is.""I kind of had this idea in the back of my head: let's see if this is possible. I thought the most likely outcome was death or at least a serious injury,"" he told CNN.Alexander poses for a photo during a training session at the Kolasin ski resort on December 21, 2021.'Absolutely fearless'So Alexander booked a month-long trip back to Canada to ski, where he met former Europa Cup level ski racer, American Gordon Gray.""When we sat down for lunch, he said, ""Okay, I'll be brutally honest. Your technique -- absolutely atrocious -- the worst I've ever seen."" But to Alexander's surprise the Jamaican could keep up with the American, who had been skiing for 40 years. Despite critiquing Alexander's technique the American skier told the Jamaican that he was ""absolutely fearless.""According to Alexander, Gray added: 'If you're afraid you're never gonna get any work done, even with all the technique in the world. But if you're fearless, then we can teach you technique and I think there's a chance.""Alexander was among a dozen athletes -- including others from far-flung warmer climates like  Morocco, Ghana, and East Timor -- competing in Montenegro's Kolasin in Decemer 2021, where skiers were hoping to rack up points in a final dash to qualify for the games in Beijing next year.In just 22 months, Alexander shaved down his FIS race points from over 600 to under the required 160 point minimum. By January, he had secured the last of the 160 International Ski Federation (FIS) points needed to qualify for the games by finishing seventh in the giant slalom at the Cape Verde National Ski Championships in Liechtenstein.Fast forward to 2022 and Alexander will on Sunday represent Jamaica in the Winter Games. ""Qualification -- that was the finish line that I was running towards everything else now above, above and beyond. This is just the icing on the cake. I'm competing with people that have been skiing since the age of two ski racing since the age of four.But getting to Beijing 2022 wasn't easy. Your top Winter Olympics 2022 questions, answered""I've cut myself a gazillion times on my skis, I've cracked ribs. I've had so many injuries. There's been lots of sweat; it's been hard, hard work,"" he said.""Especially during the first (Covid-19 enforced) lockdown when the chairlifts stopped working and I spent my time climbing up mountains so I could continue skiing.""I basically did 100 days of back-country skiing and climbed the equivalent of 10 Mount Everests with skis on my back and ski boots on my feet,"" he added.Alexander counts Dudley 'Tal' Stokes -- one of the members of Jamaica's first Olympic bobsled team -- as one of his mentors, and wants to offer his own guidance to Jamaica's newer Olympic hopefuls. ""I am from a working class background -- my parents were both drivers, my father was a bus driver for most of his career, and no one in my immediate family skied,"" said Alexander, who wants his story to be a ""beacon of light"" and show ""it is still possible to get there.""""I think the important point is it's going to be hard at the start, but you just have to persevere."""

Now I'm invested in what you wear to dinner and can't wait to cheer you on!"" one TikTok user commented this week ahead of the qualifiers.Eileen Gu, a star freestyle skier, has been posting regular Instagram updates, including a video of her walking a ""catwalk"" in her room after trying on all of Team China's different uniforms.Read MoreWith the Beijing Olympics held during a global pandemic and not open to public spectators, athletes like Mastro's natural social persona have helped drive traffic to more mainstream broadcasters, who are carrying the Games.Yiannis Exarchos, CEO of Olympic Broadcasting Services, called social media a ""huge area of potential,"" at a Thursday press conference, singling out TikTok as the social platform generating most of the Olympics conversation.Gen Z were particularly active in contributing to the Olympics hype, Exarchos said.Mastro has 540,000 TikTok followers.'Real feelings'Ahead of the women's halfpipe qualifiers, Mastro posted NBC's streaming schedule for the event after some users asked where they would able to cheer her on.After Mastro failed to advance to the halfpipe final, she waited some time before updating her more than 540,000 followers.""Yesterday was not a good day. I'm so bummed on the outcome,"" she said as she sat on her bed wearing what she has called her ""trusty red beanie"".""I wasn't able to show the snowboarding I wanted to show in the qualies (qualifiers) ... and I'm just really, really bummed,"" she said, tearing up on camera.The post has since been viewed nearly 500,000 times and attracted more than 3,000 messages of encouragement telling the snowboarder to remain positive despite the disappointing result.""Ridiculously cool to see somebody come out and show the real feelings behind this,"" one of the commenters said."

But one wrong move could send her tumblingBy Jessie Yeung, CNNUpdated 1051 GMT (1851 HKT) February 8, 2022Hong Kong (CNN)At this year's Beijing Winter Olympics, the face of China's sporting dreams is undeniably American.Freestyle skier Eileen Gu's rise to the top has been meteoric -- and her popularity in China has exploded in the lead-up to the Games. ""Snow princess Gu Ailing set to shine at home Olympics,"" read one headline in state-run media Xinhua, referring to Gu by her Chinese name.But Gu, 18, has another home: the United States, where she was born to a Chinese mother and American father, and where she first discovered her love for the sport. In 2015, just a few months after she reached her first World Cup podium, the San Francisco native announced she was switching to compete for China instead of the US -- a controversial decision that thrust her firmly into the spotlight.""This was an incredibly tough decision for me to make,"" she wrote in an Instagram post at the time. ""I am proud of my heritage, and equally proud of my American upbringings.""A delivery worker rides pasts an advertisement showing Eileen Gu, at a bus stop in Beijing on January 11.She has since become a household name in China. Walk down the street and you'll see her face splashed across billboards and magazine covers. Promotional videos ahead of the Olympics show Gu performing tricks midair and running on the Great Wall. She has nearly 2 million followers on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, as well as multiple Chinese sponsors, brand deals, and documentary teams following her every movement. Read MoreBut behind her success is the heavy pressure of being both Chinese and American at a time of intense geopolitical tensions; of representing her mother's homeland, a country under fire in the West for alleged human rights abuses; and of trying to be an athlete and nothing more during one of the most controversial Olympics in recent history. She's not the only one walking this tightrope -- the Beijing Olympics feature an unprecedented number of foreign-born athletes competing for China, many hailing from North America. Among them, Gu has become a poster child for an ambitious China, eager to show it has the power to attract foreign talent and mold a new type of Chinese athlete on the world stage.But these athletes -- especially those of Chinese descent -- face an impossible balancing act as they straddle two countries and navigate the complexities of a dual identity in the public eye. An impossible positionMore than a dozen athletes representing China at the Olympics are foreign-born -- and most are on the men's hockey team, where only six of the 25 members are homegrown nationals.Switching citizenship for sport is actually quite common internationally -- China is just late to the game, said Susan Brownell, an expert on Chinese sports at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The shift is especially unusual given that China is highly homogenous with some of the world's strictest immigration rules. ""China never did things like this before,"" Brownell added.There are plenty of Caucasian faces in the mix with no Chinese ethnicity or obvious link to the country, such as former NHL players Jake Chelios and Jeremy Smith. But it's the athletes of Chinese descent who are under the most scrutiny, such as Canadian-born hockey player Brandon Yip and US-born ice skater Zhu Yi, formerly known as Beverly Zhu. These Asian countries are giving dual citizens an ultimatum on nationality -- and loyaltyZhu's disappointing Olympic debut served to illustrate the unique pressures facing these athletes. After she fell flat on the ice and finished last in the women's short program team event Sunday, Chinese social media exploded in scorn and vitriol directed at the 19-year-old skater.On Weibo, the hashtag ""Zhu Yi has fallen"" gained 200 million views in just a few hours. Many questioned why Zhu was picked for the team at the expense of a Chinese-born athlete, while others criticized her halting Mandarin. ""This is such a disgrace,"" said a comment with 11,000 upvotes. Gu and Zhu are mirror images in many ways -- both born in California, only a year apart in age -- but Gu has charmed the public with her fluent Mandarin and familiarity with Chinese culture, and has received little of the Chinese skepticism that dogs Zhu. Gu advanced to the Big Air finals at her first qualifying competition on Monday, after being introduced by the announcer as a ""favorite"" and drawing a roar from the excited crowd. But it's unclear whether that adulation will continue if Gu doesn't deliver the gold medals she's tipped to win.And Gu's fame brings its own challenges. Fox News has labeled her the ""ungrateful child of America,"" a sentiment found frequently under her social media posts, as well as that of hockey players like Chelios.""Nice to see you take all your USA successes and accomplishments to China and not represent where you were born and raised,"" a commenter wrote under one of Gu's Instagram posts last week.Some have accused her of placing profit and prestige above taking a stand on human rights issues, with critics taking particular aim at the high-profile sponsorships she has landed in China. The US is leading a diplomatic boycott of the Games, citing the alleged human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in China's western Xinjiang region -- which Gu has stayed quiet on.

It ended up working out for both skaters in the end; some nations returned their Olympic quota spots, opening up an extra spot that would allow both Jackson and Bowe to compete.

She creates social media content in both English and Chinese, posts photos from Shanghai and California, cracks jokes for American audiences on TikTok while starring in Chinese-language documentaries in the mainland. ""When I'm in China, I'm Chinese. When I'm in the US, I'm American,"" Gu told Olympic Channel at the Lausanne 2020 Youth Winter Olympics. Just last week, she alluded to this dual identity in a caption on Instagram. ""Having been introduced to the sport growing up in the US, I wanted to encourage Chinese skiers the same way my American role models inspired me,"" she wrote.But as much as she wants to express both parts of her heritage and stay away from politics, it seems the world won't let her. And China's embrace of Gu also reflects its uncompromising view of nationality, which has become more insular and forceful under Chinese President Xi Jinping: either you're Chinese or you're not. The citizenship debateHanging over Gu -- and many of the foreign-born athletes -- is the question of citizenship.JUST WATCHEDReporters press Eileen Gu over her citizenship. See how she respondsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHReporters press Eileen Gu over her citizenship. See how she responds 04:00China does not allow dual citizenship, with the government cracking down in recent years and encouraging the public to report people secretly holding two passports. There are very few exceptions to the ban, and it's highly unlikely any of these exceptional circumstances apply to the athletes in question, said Donald Clarke, a professor at the George Washington University Law School specializing in Chinese law.""The only way the hockey players could become Chinese citizens is to become naturalized, and under China's nationality law, they need to renounce their foreign citizenship,"" Clarke told CNN. The same goes for Gu.Eileen Gu after placing first in the Women's Freeski Halfpipe competition at the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix on January 8, 2022 in Mammoth, California. But it's not clear whether that has been enforced. Gu has never publicly shared whether she renounced her US citizenship to compete for China, and speculation grew after she applied for the US Presidential Scholars Program in 2021, which is only open to US citizens or permanent residents. The official Olympics site appeared to confirm her status in a January article that referred to Gu's ""dual nationality.""Both Clarke and Brownell said the more likely scenario is that China bent its own rules to allow foreign-born athletes to keep two passports, hoping to bolster its Olympic medal count -- long touted by the Chinese government as a sign of national strength.This strategy might be ""an experiment by the Chinese leadership, which will judge the public reaction before deciding whether to move forward with the practice on a larger scale and allowing dual citizenship to athletes,"" Brownell said.Chinese officials have carefully avoided the question of Gu's nationality, instead emphasizing her Chinese heritage. She is what the government often refers to as ""overseas Chinese"" -- foreign nationals of Chinese descent, given that label regardless of their citizenship or how many generations of their family have lived abroad. An Olympics like no other: Can sports overcome the controversy of Beijing 2022?Since Xi took office, he has repeatedly asserted that overseas Chinese, too, belong to the nation -- and repeatedly pledged to ""unite overseas Chinese"" with their relatives in China as part of the ""Chinese dream.""It seems that Gu is part of that Chinese dream, with the government and its propaganda machine going full steam in claiming her as their own.""I have very very deep roots in China,"" Gu told state broadcaster CCTV, according to state-run nationalist tabloid Global Times. She added that she had been in China when it was announced the Winter Games would be held in Beijing, which is when ""I started thinking about competing for China.""In one piece, Xinhua noted that Gu visited Beijing every summer growing up, watched the 2008 Beijing Olympics from the stands, and loves Peking duck and dumplings.

The Beijing Games aren't likely to break itBy Hannah Ryan, CNNUpdated 0020 GMT (0820 HKT) February 5, 2022 (CNN)Last year's Tokyo Olympics are destined to be remembered for many reasons. They took place amid a state of emergency in the Japanese capital -- declared as the city was dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases -- and events were staged with little to no spectators to cheer athletes on.But the Games made history for another reason, too. They featured more out LGBTQ+ participants than any known previous Olympics.Of the 11,000 Olympians competing in Tokyo, at least 186 identified as LGBTQ, according to the SB Nation blog Outsports -- a groundbreaking moment in the history of the representation of marginalized sexualities and gender identities in the sporting world.Outsports reports that the Beijing Games will have a record number of out athletes for the Winter Games at 35 -- yet, it looks like those Olympians may be performing in the shadow of growing challenges faced by sexual minorities and their supporters in China.Although the nation removed homosexuality from its official list of mental disorders in 2001, the LGBTQ community in China continues to face official harassment and same-sex marriage remains illegal across the country. Tom Daley, who identifies as openly gay, at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021Read MoreIn recent years, the Chinese government has accelerated its pressure on LGBTQ+ rights and spaces. In 2017, Chinese authorities banned online video platforms from sharing content that contained the depiction of ""abnormal sexual behaviors"" -- which, according to those authorities, included same-sex relationships.In July 2021, WeChat -- a popular messaging app in the country -- shut down more than a dozen of LGBTQ+ accounts run by university students and sparked widespread concern over the censorship of gender and sexual minorities. The year before, Shanghai Pride -- China's longest-running Pride event usually attended by thousands of LGBTQ+ people from across the nation -- abruptly canceled all their scheduled activities due to mounting pressure from local authorities, according to a source with knowledge of the situation that spoke to CNN at the time.The organizers posted an open letter online titled ""The End of the Rainbow"" and said they would also be taking a break from scheduling all future events. They gave no reason for the Pride cancellation in the letter but a person not associated with Shanghai Pride -- but with knowledge of the situation -- told CNN at the time that the all-volunteer team had been facing mounting pressure from local authorities, to the point of where it was disrupting their day jobs and normal lives.A man holds a rainbow flag after taking part in the Pride Run in Shanghai in June 2017. Shanghai Pride shut down abruptly in 2020 and has not returned sinceCNN spoke to one LGBTQ+ community leader in Beijing about the climate on this topic right now. CNN agreed to refer to him only as ""AJ"" due to the sensitivity of the topic and his fear of negative repercussions. AJ said that it is ""becoming more and more challenging for Chinese LGBTQ+ non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to run projects.""He added that many LGBTQ+ organizations are ""on the brink of closing as funds run dry"" in an increasingly censored environment.He also said that the capital's local LGBTQ+ community will be sad not to be able to watch in person as see Olympians compete in the Beijing Games in person due to the current Covid-19 restrictions in place in the city -- ""especially out LGBTQ+ athletes."" On January 17, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced tickets for the Games would not go on sale for international visitors or the general public, citing Covid-19 concerns. Instead, it decided groups of spectators would need to be invited to fill the stands -- Olympic venues will be split between spectators from inside Beijing's ""closed loop"" system and those outside of it, according to Vice President of the Beijing Organizing Committee, Yang Shu'an. Those outside of the ""closed loop"" -- which is made up of Games-related personnel -- will include international people residing in mainland China, diplomatic personnel, marketing partners, winter sports enthusiasts, residents and local students. In China's sporting world, athletes who openly identify as LGBTQ+ as part of their public image are few and far between. In June 2021, Li Ying -- a prominent footballer for the Chinese women's national team -- posted photos of herself and her girlfriend to mark their anniversary on the social media platform Weibo. Chinese media commentators noted it as a turning point for LGBTQ athletes in public life. But Li's account was flooded with homophobic abuse after going viral and the post was later deleted without explanation. As the attention of the international sporting community turns to Beijing while the Winter Olympics unfold, the censorship placed on the city's LGBTQ+ population citizens and the glaring lack of out LGBTQ+ athletes representing China is thrust under a global spotlight.According to former pro snowboarder Simona Meiler, clampdowns on LGBTQ+ liberties and censorship such as those that exist in China are contrary to the core principles of the Olympic Charter.""The Charter is supposed to uphold the rights of all and to discourage discrimination,"" Meiler -- who identifies as gay -- told CNN Sport. ""But when the host nations of the Games violate human rights -- whether in their treatment of LGBTQ+ people or other minorities -- that goes against everything that the Charter stands for."" Indeed, the Charter states that the philosophy of Olympism ""seeks to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example, social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.""Further, the Charter's rules also make it explicitly clear that the ""enjoyment of the rights and freedoms"" in the Olympic Movement shall ""be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion,"" among other characteristics.Yet Meiler thinks the measures taken by the Chinese authorities to censor LGBTQ+ voices in the country could undermine the values of Olympism laid out by the IOC.In hosting the Games in a nation that fosters an unwelcoming environment for LGBTQ+ people, the Olympic Charter's ""respect for universal fundamental ethical principles"" is called into question, Meiler suggests. ""IOC may have rules in place designed to protect the rights of marginalized people, such as the Charter,"" Meiler said. ""But I rarely see the IOC actually enforce its own rules.""Simona Meiler, a former pro snowboarder, at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, RussiaIn a statement to CNN Sport, the IOC said that its remit ""is to ensure that there is no discrimination at the Olympic Games and that all athletes can compete and live together under one roof in the Olympic Village whatever their backgrounds or beliefs are and free from fear and any form of discrimination."" The IOC also told CNN Sport that ""by carrying out this vital mission, the Olympic Games showcase how the world could be if the world would be free from any prejudice.""""At the same time, the IOC has neither the mandate nor the capability to change the laws or the political system of a sovereign country,"" the statement said. ""This must rightfully remain the legitimate role of governments and respective intergovernmental organizations.""China, meanwhile, has repeatedly condemned actions they characterize as attempts to politicize sports. Just last week, 243 human rights groups and non-governmental organizations called for action against China's ""atrocity crimes and other grave human rights violations,"" urging governments to join a diplomatic boycott of the Games and for athletes and sponsors ""not to legitimize government abuses."" Australia, the UK, and Canada are among nations that joined a US-led diplomatic boycott of the Games. India also announced a last minute diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics on February 3.CNN has reached out to the Chinese Foreign Ministry about the concerns of LGBTQ+ citizens in the country and LGBTQ+ athletes but has not yet received a response.But after several countries, including the United States, announced a diplomatic boycott of the Games in response to alleged genocide in China's northwestern Xinjiang region -- allegations China denies -- China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, ""no one would care whether they come or not,"" adding, ""the Winter Olympic Games is not a stage for political posturing.""Meiler herself has first-hand experience of attending a Winter Olympics held in a country that makes it difficult for LGBTQ+ individuals to live in peace and without fear of censorship or violence. She attended the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia -- a nation Human Rights Watch accused at the time of failing to protect LGBTQ+ people, to have ""effectively legalized discrimination"" against them, and to have ""cast them as second-class citizens.""At the time, President Vladimir Putin said Russia's priority was ""a healthy traditional family and a healthy nation.""When speaking about Sochi and the upcoming Beijing Games, Meiler points out that the honor of hosting the Olympics or other prestigious sporting events allows nations to deflect from serious questions about accusations of alleged wrongdoing. She notes that being awarded the right to hold the Olympic Games can provide positive PR for countries that may otherwise be negatively perceived because of the allegations they're facing.Simona Meiler competing during the women's snowboard cross qualification event the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games""These nations -- accused of human rights abuses -- want to present the best possible image they can to the rest of the world,"" Meiler said. ""So, when they bid to host the Olympics and other competitions and when they then get to hold them, they make sure that they put forward an upstanding version of themselves.""Protest and prideMeiler pointed to the recent case of the Qatar Grand Prix in November as she considered what athletes themselves can do to show support to marginalized communities when nations accused of serious human rights violations are chosen to host global sporting events.""When it comes to the question of what athletes can do as they compete in tournaments held in nations that are hostile towards LGBTQ+ people, for example, I think others could look to the Lewis Hamilton approach,"" she told CNN Sport. Meiler is referring to celebrated driver and 7 time world champion Hamilton's decision to wear a helmet that featured the Pride Progress flag -- a more inclusive version of the traditional rainbow flag associated with LGBTQ+ Pride -- and included the words ""We Stand Together"" during a practice race at the Qatar Grand Prix.""With the platform that athletes have, on a stage as big as the Winter Games, they have a real opportunity to raise awareness of the issues affecting the place they're competing in and beyond,"" Meiler said. ""For me, personally, it was never an option for me to not be out -- I knew that even if I reached one or two LGBTQ+ people by being an out and open athlete, it was important.""Whether or not athletes choose to take the Hamilton approach in Beijing is yet to be seen. But what has apparently been made clear is that any competitor making a protest at the Games, for any reason, may face condemnation for doing so.At a press briefing on January 19, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson was asked for comment on the reports that a member of the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee had warned that ""foreign athletes may face punishment for any speech that violates Chinese law"" during the Winter Games. Zhao Lijian -- the spokesperson -- said: ""As I understand, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has published a statement on the ban on political protests, which asks Olympic athletes not to protest at any Olympic venues or podiums by taking a knee or in other forms. We hope certain media would not take things out of context and maliciously hype them up to attack and discredit China.""Yet, Zhao also added that he wanted to ""reiterate that China welcomes all athletes to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, and will ensure the safety and convenience of all Olympians."" If Olympians are indeed prevented from demonstrating against policies that make life harder for LGBTQ+ people in China, there are other ways to highlight such issues, Meiler suggests. ""The best thing that I could do with my platform is to be myself and to have another woman waiting for me at the finish line,"" Meiler said. ""Just showing that we exist, at competitions all over the world, is a big part of the fight for LGBTQ+ recognition.""Upholding the Olympic valuesIn 2014, Eric Radford -- a Canadian pair ice skater -- came out at the height of his career.Earlier that same year, the Winter Games were held in Sochi as Russia continued to crack down on LGBTQ+ rights following the introduction of legislation that outlawed the ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations around minors"" and effectively banned children and young people from learning about LGBTQ+ lives and relationships. Russia's Justice Ministry denied that the law was discriminatory, according to state media reporting at the time.Radford -- who competed in those Olympics -- told CNN Sport that when the IOC is deciding on where to host the Winter Games, ""a nation's attitude towards LGBTQ+ rights should absolutely be taken into consideration.""Pair ice skater Eric Radford at the opening of Pride House hosted by Canada House at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter OlympicsHe acknowledged the complicated nature of choosing where such a major event in the global sporting calendar should be held, but maintained that a nation's stance on human rights, including LGBTQ+ freedoms, should always be of the utmost importance when searching for a new host.""Perhaps one way to avoid holding the Olympic Games in a place that is hostile towards LGBTQ+ people and marginalized communities would be to decide on a select group of cities in countries that have been fully vetted for their record on human rights and their treatment of LGBTQ+ citizens and rotate between them every four years,"" Radford said. The decorated skater -- echoing Meiler -- also insisted that the IOC is responsible for ensuring that its words on encouraging tolerance and stamping out inequality are put into effective action, particularly at the Beijing Games.""It's the IOC's job to uphold what the Olympics represent -- such as the value of inclusion and the idea that Olympism is open to all,"" Radford said. ""I think what the IOC really needs to do is be vocal in its support of LGBTQ+ athletes and the wider community.""He added: ""It's one thing [for the IOC] to say that it doesn't accept discrimination, but it has to do more than that. It has to go further. For example, the IOC could share the stories of LGBTQ+ athletes across its social media to try and reach people in places where there isn't much exposure to LGBTQ+ lives.""At the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, skier Gus Kenworthy's kiss with his then-boyfriend Matthew Wilkas served as a historic moment in LGBTQ+ visibility in sports while figure skater Adam Rippon used the Olympic platform to criticize former US Vice President Mike Pence's stance on LGBTQ+ rights. With this year's Games now underway, the world will soon find out if the Beijing Winter Olympics do have a chilling effect on LGBTQ+ rights and freedoms in global sports."
sport,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/sport/skijoring-winter-olympics-usa-salt-lake-spt-intl/index.html,"Lost sports of the Winter Olympics: Skijoring, the wild blend of horses and skis","By Jack Bantock, CNNVideo by Finn McSkimming"," (CNN)This Friday, a highly-anticipated winter sporting competition with a rich history will get underway -- but it's not the Winter Olympics in Beijing.Over 6,000 miles away from the Chinese capital in Kamas, Utah, thousands will flock to High Star Ranch to watch skiers hurtle around a course of jumps, rings, and gates.Some of these competitors will reach speeds of 40 miles an hour -- an impressive feat given they are essentially racing on a flat course. Though these skiers have a trick up their sleeve -- or, more accurately, a trick galloping at the other end of their rope. Yeehaw! Don your cowboy hat and canter into the wild world of western-style skijoring -- otherwise known as ""Ben Hur on snow,"" HistoryRead MoreExhibited at St Moritz, Switzerland in 1928, skijoring holds the honor of being the first ever demonstration sport at a Winter Olympics, yet the discipline's origins extend well beyond its Games debut. Practiced differently across continents, the history of skijoring is a complex one. Fortunately, there exists a one-woman fountain of knowledge for all things skijoring in Loren Zhimanskova, President of SkijorUSA and Skijor International.A key coordinator for American skijoring and central to the sport's growing reputation in the region, Zhimanskova's passion for skijoring is matched only by her seemingly endless knowledge of its history and its people.Born in Europe, skijoring has taken many forms over the years. It began with skiers being pulled by reindeer in Lapland, before trying their hand behind horses, dogs and -- popularized in the 1950s -- behind motorcycles and cars.Zhimanskova has even heard of skijorers being towed by airplanes, though she insists that riders let go before take-off. St Moritz's frozen lake -- host to the glitzy annual White Turf event since 1907 -- has been described as the sport's spiritual home, but skijoring took a trip across the Atlantic not long after and has since blossomed into an ever-growing discipline in America. To rider or not to rider?The central difference to the European version of skijoring is that in the US, the horse has a rider.While in Switzerland many competitors grow up on horse ranches and ski, in the US most are either very accomplished horsemen or very accomplished skiers.For many American riders and skiers, the start line will be the first time they meet each other. ""They just put their talents together and give it their best shot -- it's fun that way,"" Zhimanskova told CNN.  At White Turf, competitors will race twice around a full flat oval track -- leaving gates at the same time -- whereas the Western style sees skijorers navigate an obstacle course spotted with jumps, hoops to collect, and gates to pass through in a time-trial format.White Turf has been described as the ""playground of the rich and famous,"" with sponsors ranging from BMW to Credit Suisse, and Zhimanskova finally realized her dream of experiencing the glamor first-hand in 2016.""When I walked onto that frozen lake, I felt like this was hallowed ground,"" Zhimanskova said.""As a historian, I'm really here and I'm really going to see this. And it was every bit as spectacular as I had imagined.""It also gave Zhimanskova the opportunity to share with locals how the sport was being done differently in the US. Their reaction? ""You're crazy.""""They had no idea how we were skijoring here,"" Zhimanskova said.""And I said, 'Well that's funny you say that because when I describe how you do skijoring in Switzerland ... we think you're crazy!' So we had a good laugh.""American hospitalityIf White Turf is the Monaco Grand Prix of skijoring, does the US have a Super Bowl equivalent?Despite some old events like Leadville, Colorado -- a 73-year-old venue that sees competitors race through the town's main street -- the US does not have a showpiece event, yet this is by design.The soul of American Skijoring is its sprawling diversity and uniqueness from venue to venue. Whilst White Turf takes place once a year across three Sundays in February, the US skijoring season runs from early January to mid March with venues spread from Calgary down the spine of the Rocky Mountains to Ridgeway.Whilst racers can expect a broadly similar format in terms of track length and snow depth, all races are independently run -- each sculpted to the desires of the organizers. Some events, like Leadville, are run down a main street. Others take place on rodeo grounds or in a hay field. All have different prize pots -- ranging as high as $40,000 to a simple jackpot made up of registration fees. Some races will even reward the victorious skijorer with a horse or custom saddle.Incorporating skijoring as the center-piece of a wider weekend festival -- flushed with food and live music -- is an increasingly popular trend, but two-day, standalone racing formats remain. A new event in Canterbury Park, Minnesota offers a hugely popular freestyle event -- showcasing skiers letting go of the ropes over jumps to do tricks in front of growing crowds of over 10,000. A newly emerged snowboarding division also continues to blossom.""Everybody really does want to do it their way ... I respect this, it is the nature of sport in the US to be supple,"" Zhimanskova said.""I think as a community we're very united, it's just that all of our events need to have their own local flavor.""Cowboy camaraderieAs such, Zhimanskova and SkijorUSA acts as the coordinating central hub of skijoring in the region.Supported by Zhimanskova's relentless efforts, skijoring in the US has enjoyed a golden age over the last decade. Some 23 races are slated for 2022, with two more potentially to come in Canada.Despite skijoring's US expansion and the swathes of new faces, the core community remains incredibly tight knit. For Zhimanskova, permanently on the road, this camaraderie lies at the heart of her love for the sport.""When I travel, I don't like to feel like a tourist,"" Zhimanskova said.""I like to integrate, I like to be able to hang out with people at the local bar and just chat about life in that town. Everybody's having a great time and everybody's helping each other, which is wonderful. ""Yes it's a competition, but it's that kind of rodeo cowboy culture where you need to have your buddy's back because you never know when your horse trailer is gonna break down and you're going to need somebody to help you.""Joe Loveridge, competitor and organizer of Friday's big event in Utah, could not agree more.""I love the camaraderie, the adrenaline, and that anyone can do it,"" Loveridge told CNN.""There's no better way to blend a ski town loaded with skiers and the western heritage and cowboy life.""The sport brings together different types of folks and provides some high-paced action and also allows new and young people to participate.""The Cowboy Channel will broadcast five skijoring races annually, and Zhimanskova is working towards a number of potentially high-profile sponsorships including Justin Boots and Cinch Jeans.There's even been interest in a reality TV show to potentially follow some of the sport's eccentric personalities around the circuit. Operation OlympicsWhilst Zhimanskova is doubtful that skijoring would ever be slated on the official Olympic schedule -- citing reasons surrounding the Games' complicated relationship with animals -- she would be keen to reignite the demonstration tradition or incorporate it into the opening ceremony for a forthcoming Games.Not least because 2028 marks the 100th anniversary of skijoring at the Olympics and there's a prospect of Salt Lake City potentially being the host city for the 2030 or 2034 Games.Picture the scene: a cowboy or cowgirl riding a horse into the opening ceremony bearing the American flag, followed in tow by a skier carrying the Olympic torch.""I think it really represents the American spirit,"" Zhimanskova said.""The freedom, the love for the outdoors and the environment, the ability to come together from different backgrounds, different worlds and compete as a team. ""Of course, the horse is also just an iconic animal that's been so important to our growth as a country."""
sport,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/sport/valorant-esports-women-diversity-spt-intl/index.html,The game boosting diversity in esports and creating role models for the next generation,"By Ben Church, CNNVideo by Finn McSkimming, CNN"," (CNN)Those within esports often get tired with constant comparisons with traditional sports, but the increasingly popular world of competitive gaming can often be an example for those more historic sports to follow. While the industry as a whole is still male-dominated, organizations have launched projects in the hope of creating a more diverse gaming environment.An example of this is the Valorant Game Changers initiative which looks to provide a platform for marginalized genders to compete and develop into professional players. Valorant is a first-person shooting game developed by Riot Games -- of League of Legends fame -- and has approximately 12 million players logging in each month.The Game Changers series runs alongside the main competition and looks to foster marginalized talent in a safe environment away from any potential harassment. Read MoreRiot Games' Senior Brand Manager Vera Wienken has worked closely on launching the initiative and says it's already been a success. ""It is very important to us to have real representation of the community within esports, within our pro players, coaches, managers,"" she told CNN Sport.""Therefore, we founded Game Changers and really hope to see that, in the future, esports overall becomes more diverse.""READ: Esports is on the rise in Africa and these two Kenyans are leading the chargeJUST WATCHEDMeet the UAE's first female esports teamReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet the UAE's first female esports team 03:50'You don't need to sing it to the world'Wienken says representation is key to attracting and maintaining female participation in Valorant and esports in general. Valorant itself is a relatively new game and Wienken thinks its format and narrative open itself up to a more diverse audience. The characters you can play as, for example, don't necessarily conform to gender stereotypes and this helps make the game more accessible, says Wienken.The gaming world often overlooks players of color. This new studio is changing that""There's a lack of role models,"" she added when asked why the industry is still attracting less women than men.""What we would like to see and what's happening already, which is amazing, is these women pro players are becoming role models for others and sharing their path, sharing their story so that women know and find their entry points."" Valorant EMEA host Yinsu Collins is one of the many to have suffered from online harassment during her career in esports, but she says she's developed a thick skin in order to ignore it. The journalist, who previously worked in traditional sports media, says Valorant has helped educate people within the industry of the discrimination marginalized groups face. ""I don't think I've ever seen a title that has produced and invested in a female scene this quickly,"" she told CNN Sport.""The way Riot were like: 'We're going to prioritize the women's side. We're not going to wait three or four years to kind of give you guys a big tournament. We're just going to do it right off the bat.'""I just think the dedication, the investment, obviously, you can see the way Riot is prioritizing having diversity.""And you don't need to sing it to the world, you just do it through your actions.""READ: How esports has helped its fans get through lockdownThose within esports hope for a day when gender is no longer spoken about. What does progress look like?While Collins has been sent negative messages on social media, she has also seen people reflect on their past actions. She says she occasionally gets messages from boys who want to apologize for certain things they've said or the way they've behaved online in the past. 'The sky's the limit on where this can go' -- The worlds of Fortnite and football collide""Hopefully, in a few years, maybe a decade's time, we wouldn't even have to talk about representation because it would just be a normal thing,"" Collins added. Wienken says Game Changers has already had a huge impact on the amount of women playing and watching the game and there is more to come from the initiative, with this year's launch of the Game Changers Academy.This new, community-driven format hopes to act as a stepping stone for young women who are interested in making it as a professional esports player.By creating these new entry points for women, Wienken hopes that there won't be a need for female-led projects such as the one she works with in the future.""I hope that we don't see gender anymore when we are looking at the professional players, and we might not even need Game Changers anymore in the future because it's just so normal that esports is diverse,"" she added. For Collins, progress is all about how the media and wider society frame women in esports. She's aware it will take time but is looking forward to the day when women in the industry aren't always asked to talk about their gender. ""Every single time a talent line up is being announced or every single time we talk about Game Changers, I want the conversations to be about how the competition is amazing or this player has a great personality or just the crazy storylines. The same way we talk about men's sport, really,"" she said. ""I think if we can get to a point where women's esports and female talent aren't just being talked about because of their gender, but they're actually being talked about because they're good at what they do, I'll be pretty satisfied."""

An ex-NFL player wants their stories to be heardBy Amy Woodyatt, CNNUpdated 1456 GMT (2256 HKT) February 2, 2022 (CNN)Throughout the bitter winter, during rain and snow, Jon Vaughn has alternated between sleeping in a tent or a campervan outside former University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel's house.  A former University of Michigan and NFL football player, Vaughn is one of more than 1,000 people --- mostly men -- who says they were abused by athletics doctor Robert Anderson, who worked for the university from 1966 to 2003 treating students across sports including football, track, and wrestling.  Anderson, who died in 2008, subjected students, 90% of whom were men, to ""sexually abusive conduct"" and invasive exams, including unnecessary genital and rectal examinations, according to a 2021 independent report commissioned by the university.  Many of Anderson's victims were Black -- and survivors say this has played a part in why the abuse was allowed to continue for decades. In his roles at the university, including director of its health service, team physician for the athletic department and a clinical instructor at the university's medical school, Anderson abused men and women from different racial backgrounds, undergraduate and graduate students, student athletes -- including a two-time Super Bowl champion and former world-class wrestler -- and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community, the report found.  The university missed numerous opportunities to stop him over his 37 year long career, it concluded.  Read MoreThis month the university announced a $490 million settlement with over a thousand victims of Anderson's alleged sexual abuse, pending approval by the Michigan Board of Regents and the claimants. Dr. Robert E. Anderson worked for the University of Michigan from 1966 to 2003. He died in 2008.
But despite the settlement, the University is still facing calls to take responsibility for its role in the abuse, which spanned more than three decades -- as well as the university's failures to address alleged present day sexual misconduct and abuse by and of students and university staff.Victims say that despite knowledge of Dr. Anderson's predatory behavior, U of M failed to take any action, and instead chose to continue enabling Dr. Anderson's abuse of vulnerable young men until his voluntary retirement in 2003.   ""They've shown that over the last half century... [they're] uninterested in student safety as a priority,"" Vaughn, who played for U of M from 1988 to 1990 said. ""They've shown the inability to police themselves on a consistent basis, as pertains to sexual assault,"" he said. Schlissel -- who was fired this month from his position as President following an anonymous complaint suggesting that he ""may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with a University employee"" -- has apologized for Anderson's ""tragic misconduct,"" and said in a statement that the university is committed to resolving victims' claims.  But Vaughn, 51, who was recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer and has been protesting for more than 100 days says he will continue to sleep outside the university president's house until the University of Michigan addresses historic and alleged present day abuse, after realizing how ""acute"" issues of sexual assault, violence and rape are on campus.  Vaughn is also one of many involved in hundreds of individual lawsuits and a class-action lawsuits filed against the University and the Board of Regents by survivors.  Black men treated differently  The allegations against Anderson mirror those against disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar at Michigan State University and Richard Strauss at Ohio State University. They too were doctors who abused their trusted positions to sexually exploit college students and athletes.  With more than a thousand people -- mostly men -- coming forward to say they were abused by Anderson, attorneys representing the victims say it may be the largest case of sex abuse by a single person in the US. The scale of the alleged abuse surpasses that at Michigan State, Ohio State, and similar incidents at other US universities.  But the case has received nowhere near as much media coverage as that of the abuse of Nassar.  A disproportionate number of the victims are African American, Vaughn told CNN. ""I don't think the world right now is ready to complete that spectrum of the face of abuse and include African-American men,"" Vaughn told CNN.  Attorney Mike Cox, who is representing 174 victims in confidential federal court mediation with the University of Michigan told CNN that some 40% of the 1000 Anderson victims are African American men. ""We have not done a formal analysis because all are victims and viewed equally in that sense. But clearly the amount of African American victim survivors is much, much higher than their numbers in American society,"" Cox told CNN over email.  Black Americans represent just 13.4% of the American population. The percentage of African American survivors is also ""dramatically higher"" than their percentages as part of the UM student base, Cox said. The University of Michigan agreed to work toward a goal of 10% African American enrollment by 1973, but did not reach this goal: Black student enrollment had declined by 1987 to 5.3% of the student body from the high of 7.7% in 1976 and never reached the 10% goal targeted by administrators in the early '70's. From the 1980s until 1996, there was a 10% increase in African American student enrollment. However, efforts to increase African American enrollment to reflect the Michigan state's 14% Black population have been unsuccessful, according to the university. Vaughn said it took years for him to even recognize what had happened to him as abuse, and that in communities of color, ""for men to even discuss their abuse is seen as a weakness. In those communities, you're forced to be tough and strong.""  ""We've been fighting to have a voice, just typically in this country, for over 400 years, we're constantly and have historically been marginalized, or dehumanized in so many ways. So I really think those two factors create this perfect storm,"" he said. Jon Vaughn says he will continue his protest at the university.Attorney Parker Stinar, who represents around 200 of the survivors, agreed, adding that Anderson's case has not received anywhere near as much media coverage or public recognition as other sex abuse cases because the vast majority of survivors are older, Black men.  ""For Larry Nassar, you had prominently White, 30-year-old women, whereas for Dr. Anderson, the vast majority of the survivors are Black and in their 50s, 60s and 70s. This case is overlooked in part because of that,"" he told CNN. ""I think our society looks down on men who are sexually abused, let alone big, strong, athletic, Black men who are sexually abused, compared to female survivors of abuse,"" Stinar added. ""Because they have this societal influence that asks men: How can they allow themselves to be sexually abused?""Rebecca Wanzo, professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Washington University, St. Louis, told CNN that race plays a significant part in whether or how violence and abuse is reported by the media. ""If you don't have someone who's the face of something that they [the media] put forward, or seems like an ideal victim that people want to tell a story about, historically, that is something that can really affect the ability of a story to travel,"" she explained.  This, she said, is often an issue when it comes to reporting issues like sexual abuse and murder. ""Systemic violence often tends to get less attention, which is why violence against people of color, systemic violence in general, in terms of class and other factors, isn't reported,"" she said. Racist stereotypes  ""We don't have a language to talk about Black as rapeable in the US, because the racist stereotypes of Black men as the rapist and as violent stops us from looking at data that's been collected by the CDC for the last decade,"" Tommy Curry, professor of philosophy and personal Chair of Africana Philosophy and Black Male Studies at The University of Edinburgh told CNN. Nearly 1 in 5 (19.4%) non-Hispanic Black men have experienced contact sexual violence -- which includes rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion, and unwanted sexual contact -- in their lifetime, according to the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010-2012, which is the latest published data broken out by race or ethnicity.  Social psychology data shows ""Black men are always perceived as being taller, more aggressive, or violent, more prone to conflict, more athletic than they actually are,"" Curry said. ""And it's those social perceptions that have been linked to forms of dehumanization -- likening them to apes, sorts of primal beasts and animals -- that fit into how we think of Black men, both as athletes and as kind of super predators, as superhuman.""   Attendees add their signatures to a board in support of survivors of sexual abuse at a vigil outside the home of outgoing University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel October 13, 2021 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Former gymnast Trinea Gonczar, who testified against Larry Nassar, told CNN that in her work supporting victims of sexual abuse, she has learned ""that most men, no matter what, if they've been assaulted, they won't report based on more shame.""  Nassar, the longtime doctor for the USA Gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison on child pornography charges, and was also sentenced to a 40-to-175 year state prison sentence in Michigan after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct. Gonczar has been spending time with Vaughn in his protest to show solidarity with abuse survivors at the University of Michigan. ""In my case, as a privileged woman, my perpetrator is in jail, we received a settlement. I'm White, and I come from an expensive, per se, sport: you have to have money to have to be in that sport,"" Gonczar said. Gonczar now works as director of development at the Avalon Healing Center, which provides support for victims of sexual abuse.  ""I've had to learn that I am a privileged, White person, and all abuse is not the same,"" she said. There are several reasons why Black men choose not to report abuse, Curry told CNN. ""We know from interviews with Black male victims that it's not only the pressures of not being believed -- but it's also being perceived as the aggressor,"" he explained. Curry said that his research had shown that in domestic violence cases, Black men would stay in situations of abuse, or they would not report victimization.  ""They fear that the police or the criminal justice system or society is going to view them as the perpetrator and they'll be criminalized even harsher than the kinds of abuse and violence that they suffer,"" Curry said.  When Black men report that they have been victimized by others, ""different stereotypes activate"", Curry added. ""A lot of racists would say, 'No, he was really the aggressor, he tried to rape me, I wouldn't rape a man. It wasn't me. This person was violent or aggressive, or he's a drug dealer, a thief.'  ""All these racial stereotypes are utilized to undercut the credibility of Black men who are victims in ways that other groups don't have to deal with,"" he said. Conditions that enable abuse Attorney Stephen Estey told CNN that Anderson was easily able to take advantage of his victims. ""Some of these men, they came from the inner city [which had] not the best healthcare in the back of the day,"" Estey, who represents some 80 survivors, said. ""Some of them never had a physical [examination], and so they didn't know what a physical should have been. And Dr. Anderson would tell them, if you want to play football, it's part of the process,"" Estey told CNN.  Wanzo said that a nationwide commitment to protecting athletic programs ""particularly makes Black people vulnerable in the US because they are disproportionately often in some of these programs."" Anderson first served as a University Health Services doctor and was moved to the Athletic Department in 1981 after ""credible reports of misconduct"" were relayed to the then Assistant Vice President of Student Services Thomas Easthope in late 1978 or 1979, according to the WilmerHale report.  ""The fact that they switched him out of general care to the athletic program as if they [athletes] were sort of disposable people says a lot about how the institution thought about how to deal with the problem person: they value athletics as institution, but the people who participate in athletics and make some money are disposable.""  Vaughn told CNN that there are a ""number of dynamics"" aside from race that help perpetuate ""this culture of abuse in sport."" ""I think it is the athlete's dedication to this specific sport, and the overwhelming trust that they tend to have in their coaches and trainers because of the focus that it takes to be successful in sport,"" Vaughn said. Coaches and medical staff are often the most powerful people in a child and student athlete's life, he added. If sports create the perfect conditions for abuse, then institutions are failing to regulate themselves, survivors say. ""It's really the institutions that are protecting their brands, and the position that they hold within that sport, because they really want that sport to be a catalyst for their financial gain instead of taking concern about their sports doctors who are actually predators,"" Gonczar, a gymnast who was treated by Nassar for 15 years, and who estimates that she was molested some 856 times, said.  A number of the women said they had reported Nassar's abuse previously but that the systems of authority, including USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Michigan State University, did not take their concerns seriously.""Absolutely not enough has changed,"" Gonczar said.  ""In the US it's taking so long to just simply get these big institutions to be aware and to be willing to be accountable and transparent, and to have people in the leadership roles that are willing to facilitate that,"" Gonczar warned.  Campus abuse between students ongoing issue The University of Michigan finalized a new sexual and gender based misconduct policy in September, but critics say abuse and assault between students and by university staff still isn't being dealt with well enough. Vaughn said that since he has been protesting, he has been approached by students who have told him of their own experiences of sexual assault and abuse at the university. There were 157 allegations of sexual assault reported to the University's Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, according to its yearly report. The University's Division of Public Safety and Security, which records incidents reported to the DPSS, law enforcement agencies and campus security authorities, described 18 on campus rapes and 31 reports of fondling not associated with Anderson in 2020. Some 106 reports of sexual assault were made to the University's Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC) in 2020, down from 151 in 2019 and 168 in 2018.  Vaughn says he has spoken to students who feel harrassment is still a problem at the university.There were 77 reported instances of sexual harassment and 57 reports of stalking, according to the University's Division of Public Safety and Security, which provided the data as ""additional information regarding crime reports on campus.""   Campus enrollment in 2019 stood at 48,090 students, and 47,907 enrolled in 2020. ""All the reporting agencies within the university have essentially failed all the students and all the student athletes, because they've done nothing to support in any consistent manner, or protect in any consistent manner,"" Vaughn said. ""Professors have said if you support or even help report a student's standpoint, it's like a career suicide,"" he added.  Some 42.4 percent of Michigan students said they had experienced at least one type of harassing behavior since entering school, and more than a quarter (26.9 percent) of undergraduate women reported nonconsensual sexual contact, according to a campus climate survey regarding sexual misconduct.  Out of women who say they experienced harassment, 8.9 percent of Michigan undergraduates reported the person was a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker compared to an average of 4.8 percent of undergraduates and across the 33 schools surveyed in the overall survey, which looked at responses from a total of 181,752 students from 33 colleges and universities. Some 31.8 percent of graduate or professional Michigan students reported their harasser to be a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker, compared to an average 16.5 percent in the overall survey.  Vaughn has slept in a tent and later, a trailer, to protest at the University over issues of sexual abuse and assault.Vaughn has been protesting through harsh conditions at the University of Michigan.The overall survey found that the 33 schools surveyed, more than half of undergraduate women (59.2%) and transgender, genderqueer, and non-binary students (65.1%) reported experiencing at least one harassing behavior.  ""I speak to a lot of students, many of them feel like with the assaults that have happened to them, that the university has not been able to deal with it properly,"" Charlie Kolean, chairman of Michigan Students Against Sexual Assault told CNN. ""Typically, a case will not be criminally referred. And additionally, a lot of survivors from assault, they don't want to go through the university's process reporting the assault, because it is fairly arduous,"" he added. Emma Sandberg, a former student and founder of activism group Roe v. Rape told CNN: ""Overall, it is very difficult to be a survivor at U of M. The sexual assault prevention center doesn't provide any real resources, university leadership has engaged in sexual misconduct themselves, and those who go through the all-consuming Title IX process are traumatized by it and rarely receive justice, support, or validation.  ""We need a supportive center for survivors, not just a preventative one, and we need more effective prevention methods at all levels,"" Sandberg, who graduated in in 2021, said. In addition to Anderson, at least five current and former university professors and officials have faced accusations of sexual harassment or abuse in the last few years.In a statement to CNN, Rick Fitzgerald, associate vice president of Public Affairs and Internal Communications at the University of Michigan said: ""We encourage every incident of misconduct to be reported and we take action,"" pointing towards the university's annual report for further details.  ""SAPAC has a 30-year history of supporting and advocating for survivors of sexual misconduct, through a range of supportive services, based on individual needs,"" he said, pointing towards the university's confidential resources for students and staff.He added: ""The University of Michigan always has taken sexual misconduct seriously and we have been increasing our efforts steadily,"" and that a Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center has been on campus for almost 40 years. Fitzgerald added that any case that involves criminal behavior is ""first turned over to police and the ECRT investigation is put on hold so that criminal activity can always be addressed first.""  Vaughn wants the university to overhaul its approach to misconduct. ""You cannot only celebrate parts of your history, you must deal with your entire history in order to root it out and change that culture,"" he said. ""Because the longer you ignore it, the more you perpetuate it and the more it empowers other predators, because they're watching the lack of discipline, or consequences for serial predators and rapists that then gives others the green light to make those decisions and prey on young men and young women."" Co-lead class counsel attorney E. Powell Miller told CNN his team is seeking ""class action relief for reforms, policies and procedures to prevent an Anderson problem from occurring again.""  Attorney Jonathan Selbin, co-lead class counsel in a class action suit against the University, told CNN: ""While paying money to the victims is a critical first step, U of M must also commit to system-wide changes that bring all of the stakeholders together to reform the campus and institutional culture and prevent abuses like this from ever occurring again."" Vaughn wants the university to create programs that empower students to report instances of sexual violence, and strengthen mechanisms to protect students. Last July, the university announced revisions to how it will address sexual misconduct, including the creation of a new office with ""significant"" new resources for support, education and prevention. The office was launched in August.  ""I knew that there was nothing that I could do in my protest to change what happened to me. But we could uncover the truth here at Michigan, and also make this place safer for now, and in the future, so that these atrocities don't continue to happen,"" Vaughn said. ""We want to change the narrative, as well as the culture. So until that's done, I won't be leaving.""  "

""Dad jokes and puns, mostly,"" is what LeDec quips as being key to the duo's success. ""And a lot of hard work ... we can work super hard and push ourselves beyond what we knew was possible.""The American pair say their bond off the ice influences how they perform on it, propelling them to new heights in their skating careers. After winning their second national title last month, Cain-Gribble and LeDuc are now preparing to compete in their first Winter Olympics in Beijing. It will be a landmark moment regardless of how they perform in the pairs events with LeDuc, who identifies as gay, set to become the first out, nonbinary athlete to compete at the Winter Olympics, according to Team USA. Read MoreFor the duo, who have been competing together since 2016 and have both taken breaks from competitive pairs skating, the build-up to the Games has been a chance to reflect on their own journeys.Cain-Gribble (left) and LeDuc compete at last month's US Figure Skating Championships in Nashville, Tennessee. Frequently, they say, they have found themselves at odds with skating's norms and expectations during the course of their careers. ""For a long time, Timothy and I didn't see ourselves represented, and so we didn't quite feel like we belonged,"" Cain-Gribble tells CNN Sport. ""And for a long time, people had things to say about us. Even when we teamed up, they had a lot of things to say about my body, or about Timothy's sexuality. People still will make those comments.""Cain-Gribble, who at five-foot-six is taller than most women who compete in pairs skating, has previously spoken about how body shaming almost forced her to retire from the sport. She adds: ""I think for us, it's about leading with authenticity, being our true selves out there and creating a very inclusive environment.""Cultivating that environment has meant doing things their own way, including when it comes to their costumes. The pair wear similar colors and patterns, while Cain-Gribble often competes in a long-sleeved unitard, rather than a dress. Their free skate program -- which they call ""Two Pillars of Strength"" and perform to music from the ""W.E."" soundtrack by Abel Korzeniowski -- is about ""showcasing two equally strong skaters,"" according to Erica Rand, the author of ""Red Nails, Black Skates.""""They are doing a lot of the same moves, similar things: throw jumps, lifts, side-by-side jumps together,"" Rand tells CNN Sport.""I also see a lot of emphasis on just the strong skating work. You also see that in other skaters, it's not a unique thing, but just the emphasis on some matching work in their spirals -- which is the term for skating arabesques -- and just a feeling of huge power.""Cain-Gribble and LeDuc have chosen not to portray romantic stories with their programs, as is often the case in pairs figure skating.""The girl is very fragile, or she is kind of the flower, the man comes in to save the woman, or it's a romantic Romeo and Juliet story that's often told,"" LeDuc tells CNN Sport. ""There's nothing inherently wrong with those stories, but often they're centralized and seen as the only narratives that you can portray, the only story that's worthy of being a champion or being successful. ""Ashley and I are just different in that way; we've never done a romantic story and we've never been a romantic pair. We've always been about equality and showing two amazing athletes coming together to create something beautiful.""Cain-Gribble and LeDuc won their second national title ahead of the Winter Olympics. 'Artistry and athleticism'On the way to winning their national title in Nashville, Tennessee, last month, Cain-Gribble and LeDuc topped the previous US scoring record in the short program with 79.39 points before wrapping up the title with 145.84 points in the free skate. That helped them to qualify for Beijing 2022 alongside Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier, the 2021 US champions who missed this year's competition after Frazier contracted Covid-19. But long before their masterful performance at the national championships, Cain-Gribble and LeDuc -- who are coached by the former's parents, Peter and Darlene Cain, and Nina Mozer -- each had doubts about the future of their careers. LeDuc left professional skating for two years in 2014 and spent time working on a cruise ship, while Cain-Gribble -- whose father was a professional figure skater and represented Australia at the 1980 Winter Olympics -- says she was ready to retire from skating before switching from singles to pairs with LeDuc in 2016. The chance to skate at an Olympics is a happy twist in their up-and-down skating journeys, as well as the culmination of their long-standing ambitions.""I started dreaming about the Olympics the second I saw it ... I just fell in love with this amazing mix of artistry and athleticism, and I knew I had to be a part of it,"" says LeDuc.""Being an Olympian, whether we made this team or not, is about pursuing excellence and about pursuing a dream,"" they add, ""and that's something that Ashley and I have worked a lot of years to do.""Cain-Gribble and LeDuc perform at last year's Figure Skating World Championships in Stockholm, Sweden.When it comes to being the first American nonbinary Winter Olympian, LeDuc hopes to use the platform to empower other athletes: ""Hopefully ... people watching us can feel like they can lead with authenticity, that they don't feel like they have to change things about themselves in order to reach their success in sport and to chase their dreams. ""Ashley and I have both had to forge our own paths in order to find our success. And we did that being authentically ourselves and leading with what makes us different and unique. ""I'm hopeful that's what the narrative centers around and not necessarily around me.""'Strong skating work'Authenticity is central to the duo's skating philosophy, but it's something that can be hard to come by in a sport so entrenched in tradition -- as Rand, professor of art and visual culture and of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College, explains. ""It wasn't until July 2021 that the International Skating Union changed the category of women skaters from officially being called 'ladies' to now being called 'women,'"" says Rand.JUST WATCHEDUS speed skater Maame Biney preparing for second OlympicsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS speed skater Maame Biney preparing for second Olympics 02:54""To me, that really shows you a lot about how traditional this sport has been because the idea that women are supposed to be ladies is reflected in things like costume expectation, makeup, etc."" Cain-Gribble and LeDuc, however, have bucked some of those trends. ""Ashley Cain-Gribble is not a typical women's pair skater ... One reason that they both appeal to each other is that she's not the typical skater characterized or nicknamed a 'little pair girl' and instead is not short and not extremely small,"" says Rand. ""You aren't ever seeing somebody looking like they're being a fragile person who's cradled or anything like that."" Now, with a chance to exhibit their authentic style on the Olympic stage, Cain-Gribble and LeDuc are looking to savor every moment in Beijing.  ""That's kind of been what we've been looking at for every competition this season -- just to get the most out of the experience,"" says LeDuc.""We want to feel that when we leave that ice, we've given everything we could."""

But that's how Rick Stanton used to feel. At school in the 1960s and 70s, he says he could swim and run, but any time a ball came towards him, he recalls a sense of ""complete panic.""And there can be no misunderstanding his stance on the matter. ""I just didn't get it at all. Not interested,"" he told CNN, as he remembered lunchtimes sitting well away from the action ""with the uncool kids who didn't kick balls around.""He jokes that he's only heard of English Premier League football teams because they're named after British cities, and he'll find himself consoling friends whose teams have lost a game with a dispassionate: ""Never mind, there'll be another match next week.""The way he describes himself, totally lacking in eye-hand coordination, it doesn't sound like anybody would have ever wanted him on their team, until one day, many decades later, Stanton finally got the call. This was a football team that didn't just want him, they needed him. Read MoreWhen the Wild Boars youth team was missing in Thailand, it was a desperate matter of life and death, and one that the world followed with bated breath. READ: Thai Navy SEAL dies from infection he contracted during cave rescueRick Stanton says the rescue attempt changed his life.Cave divingUp until the summer of 2018, not many people had heard of Stanton. But since leaving high school in the 1980s, he'd quietly established himself as the pre-eminent expert in his field: cave diving. It's a niche activity that suits his analytical mind and sense of adventure. ""It's a physical activity,"" Stanton told CNN. ""But a thinking activity with logistics and planning.""But the main thing was the opportunity to explore; the amateur person -- with no real monetary means -- could explore somewhere that no one else has been before. Thai boys trapped in cave meet divers at event recounting ordeal""The whole surface of the world has been photographed, but if you're the first one there in a cave, you have no idea what's around the next corner,"" he added.Stanton's passion is more like an obsession, and he has dedicated his life to it. He never married, and his house in England, cluttered with home-made diving equipment, once led a Sunday Telegraph journalist to describe him as ""not the most domesticated of men.""Whilst he wouldn't describe cave diving as a competitive activity, he concedes that ""it is a very competitive environment, people always want to be the first ones there."" It's a pursuit that has claimed the lives of many, some of whom who were known to Stanton, and he's often recovered their bodies. But he doesn't consider diving to be inherently risky.""Just because something seems dangerous doesn't mean that you have to do it in a dangerous manner,"" he said. ""Driving [a car] could be dangerous if you're a dangerous driver."" And he's in no way a thrill seeker. ""If you've got adrenaline in a cave, you're doing it wrong,"" he added. He has dived all over the world, often going further and deeper than any before him. And he's done it his own way, eschewing the flashy high-tech gadgets used by some of his rivals. His signature piece of equipment -- a flotation device -- is actually a repurposed inner tube from a motorcycle tire. If that gives the impression of a beginner, he is anything but. The rescue team pictured carrying a member of the team on a stretcher.'Complete chaos'By the time Stanton and his dive partner Jonathan Volanthen arrived at the Tham Luang Cave in Northern Thailand on June 27, he assumed the 12 boys and their coach would be dead -- they'd already been missing for four days. It was another five before he surfaced in a chamber deep in the cave and recoiled at the pungent air. ""They must be dead, we've found their bodies,"" he wrote in his autobiography 'Aquanaut,' but then they heard the voices. A moment of relief and elation was quickly followed by greater concern. ""The worst bit was after we found them,"" Stanton recalled to CNN. ""We had no idea how we were going to get them out.""   Boys rescued from Thai cave play friendly at World Cup stadiumStanton says that he's dived in more difficult caves, but this particular experience was complicated by what he discovered when planning the rescue strategy. The caves were no longer in a natural state, instead they were with filled with electrical cables, pipes and diesel fuel that was leaking from the pumps. As he maneuvered through the dark and tiny nooks and crannies of a flooded cave network, he describes a scene of ""complete chaos."" On their second day in the cave, Stanton and Volanthen had to save four pump workers who'd become isolated from their crew and trapped. Nobody even seemed to know that they were missing. It was a fraught evacuation, the men were only underwater for about 40 seconds at a time, but Stanton said they all were terrified. ""We manhandled them, put regulators in their mouths and dived only short distances, but they all pretty much panicked. I describe it as an underwater wrestling match.""At the time, the impromptu rescue was an unnecessary distraction, and it further delayed locating the boys, but it was an experience that ultimately helped get them all out alive. READ: Boys rescued from Thai cave welcomed by Manchester UnitedMembers of the 'Wild Boars' team pose to promote a Netflix series about the rescue of the team.'I'm not declaring it a miracle'As all of this was unfolding, Stanton had unwittingly become one of the main actors on the stage of a global drama. Every day, the ""stony faced Brits"" walked into the cave past the hundreds of news reporters and the stoic mothers of the missing boys. He says he's good at wearing blinkers -- he was able to cut out all of the noise -- but admits that would have been difficult if he'd been made truly aware that millions of people had become emotionally invested, all around the world. When asked why he thinks so many people cared so much, he describes the Thai cave rescue as ""the ultimate reality show."" ""As morbid as it might be, it was the uncertainty,"" he explained.Thai boys recall battle to survive cave ordeal -- and moment they were foundNobody could be sure of a happy ending to the story, not even Stanton, who had concluded that the only way to save the boys was to sedate them. It was an extraordinary gamble, inspired by their experience with the stranded pump workers, but as the monsoon rains intensified, it was ""the best of all the worst options.""Another cave diver, the Australian anesthetist Dr. Richard Harris, strongly disagreed with the idea. That was until he had dived in to see the predicament they were in. ""There was no scientific knowledge of anyone being sedated underwater,"" Stanton said. ""If you sedate anyone in the hospital, they are completely monitored and intubated and have resuscitation teams all around them."" In the National Geographic documentary film, 'The Rescue,' Dr. Harris says he felt like he was ""euthanizing"" the boys in the cave, and it was only then that the enormity of it all finally hit Stanton. ""We made the plan dispassionately, but that doesn't prepare you for the time when you sedate a boy, make them unconscious, put a mask on them, tie them up and drag them underwater. ""You're the only person cradling that boy for two and a half hours. That's when the responsibility of what you're doing really hit home."" Stanton and his team were prepared for multiple deaths, they simply didn't believe it would be possible to make 13 successful trips. But he was wrong, after three days of intense diving, the boys and their coach had all been successfully evacuated.How close was it to all going wrong? ""It's hard to say,"" Stanton chuckled. ""Because it did all go right. Thirteen consecutive positive results have some statistical relevance."" Was it a miracle? ""I'll stretch it to say that it was miraculous that all these things happened sequentially. It was a collaboration between thousands of people, it was exceptional planning,"" he said. ""It was miraculous that everything happened but I'm not declaring it a miracle.""   READ: Thai cave rescue boys sign Netflix deal for miniseriesJUST WATCHEDRescued Thai boys play soccer in ArgentinaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRescued Thai boys play soccer in Argentina 00:43Teamwork saved themBefore the Thai cave rescue, Stanton was wondering what to do with the rest of his life and also questioning what he'd been doing with his life. He'd retired as a firefighter and had become disillusioned with diving. Writing in 'Aquanaut,' he lamented: ""I'd devoted my life to reaching the pinnacle in this one activity that was absolutely pointless, it brought nothing to anybody."" But then the Wild Boars youth team entered the cave, and the rest is history. He says doesn't believe in fate, but concedes it would be hard to argue against the existence of destiny in his own narrative arc. ""It does appear that everything I have done has led in incremental steps to this,"" he said. In saving all those lives in the cave, his own life has been transformed. He's now a guest speaker in high demand, a published author and he'll soon be portrayed by the American actor Viggo Mortensen in the Ron Howard movie, 'Thirteen Lives.' Remarkably, some of the boys still go into the cave for fun, but he doesn't see much of them anymore -- the language barrier makes it difficult to develop any kind of meaningful relationship. But he knows they are grateful, the smiles on their faces when he saw them six months after the rescue told him all that he needed to know. ""They don't need to say it in words,"" he said.  And while he still doesn't consider himself to be a football fan, he does now have some appreciation for the game. ""They were a team before the rescue, during and afterwards,"" he concludes. ""And I think that played a very big part in their own survival.""We were dreading that they might challenge us to a game, because we would lose by a huge number of goals. It would be hugely embarrassing!"""

americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/americas/canada-trucker-protests-covid-thursday/index.html,Ottawa police chief says 'action is imminent' in the plan to clear the area of Covid-19 demonstrators,"By Travis Caldwell, Paradise Afshar, Paula Newton and Amir Vera, CNN"," (CNN)A nearly three-week protest in Ottawa over mandated Covid-19 precautions in Canada may be approaching its end as police tell demonstrators to either leave immediately or face legal consequences.  ""The action is imminent,"" said Steve Bell, Ottawa Police Service interim chief. ""In the past few days, we have been communicating directly with the unlawful protestors. We have told them they must leave, and we have warned them the consequences of disobeying these rules.""Officers began erecting barriers and fencing throughout the capital city's downtown core Thursday in an effort to clear the area of demonstrators, according to a series of tweets from Bell. The secured area encompasses most of Ottawa's downtown and is far larger than the protest footprint to date.Protesters and supporters gather to listen to speakers on Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022, in Ottawa.""Only those with lawful reason to enter the core, such as residents, businesses, and others with lawful reasons, will be allowed in the area,"" the chief said. ""The unlawful protesters must leave the area and will not be provided access.""Bell's statement was an attempt to assure residents that the city was restoring order by removing vehicles and people that are blocking traffic.Read More""We know you have been through a lot and we are committed to returning your streets back (to) normal,"" he told residents. ""We know that the increased police presence may be distressing to some. They are here to keep you safe and complete our mission.""Fact check: Strong majority of Canadians oppose convoy protests, poll after poll findsMany demonstrators have vowed to hold out for as long as necessary, and the federal government has moved to enact emergency powers to freeze financial support of the protests despite opposition in Parliament.During a news conference, Bell was asked about a timeline for removing protesters and concerns regarding demonstrations over the weekend.""What I can tell you is this weekend will look very different from the past three weekends,"" he said. Bell maintained that authorities would like the protests to end peacefully and that they've considered ""many different circumstances that could exist within the footprint of the demonstration and in and around it, and we're actually planning for several different eventualities.""""We want people to peacefully leave,"" the chief said. ""But I can tell you that if they do not peacefully leave, we have plans, strategies and tactics to be able to get them to leave."" Beginning with a group of truckers arriving in Ottawa in late January objecting to a vaccine mandate, the protest has morphed into a general airing of grievances against all Covid-19 safety protocols. The incessant noise, shutting down of area businesses and reports of hate crimes and vandalism by protesters have exacerbated the nerves of many residents.Snow falls around a demonstrator waving a flag  outside  parliament in Ottawa on February 17, 2022.Following criticism for the prolonged situation and the recent stepping down of the chief, Ottawa police said in a statement Wednesday that anyone coming to the capital to join the protest could have their vehicles seized. A charge or conviction ""may lead to denial in crossing the USA border,"" the statement said.The Children's Aid Society of Ottawa, a nonprofit organization that gets funding from the Ontario government, is urging demonstrators to make care arrangements for their children as police move forward with ending the protest.  ""If parents and children are separated following police efforts in ending the demonstration in the downtown core, CASO will work to reunite families as soon as possible,"" the organization said in a statement.The latest moves from police come as border crossing blockades along the Canadian-US border have winded down this week. There were no delays at the Emerson checkpoint in Manitoba Thursday morning, according to the Canadian Border Services Agency's website, after the peaceful departure of protesters Wednesday ended the last remaining border disruption. No one was charged, no vehicles were towed and no injuries occurred, officials said. Conservatives object to emergency powersAs authorities work to clear demonstrations in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plan to invoke the Emergencies Act to end the protest and cut off the financial support is being criticized by opposition leadership in Parliament. Candice Bergen, interim leader of the Conservative Party, said Wednesday the party won't be supporting a motion by the federal government to use those powers, according to CNN newsgathering partner CTV.Bergen said Trudeau didn't do enough to bring an end to the demonstrations before invoking the act, CTV reported.Traveling to Canada during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go""The first act that he does when he has a chance to do something -- he doesn't go through step one, two, three -- he goes straight to 100 and invokes the Emergencies Act,"" Bergen told CTV News. ""I don't think anything that we will see will change our mind, we will be opposing it.""The act, passed in 1988 and never utilized before, can temporarily suspend citizens' rights to free movement or assembly. It can also provide for the use of the military, but Trudeau has said this would not be necessary.Trudeau defended his decision to invoke the Emergencies Act during an address to Parliament on Thursday. ""We did it to protect families and small businesses. To protect jobs and the economy. We did it because the situation could not be dealt with under any other law in Canada,"" Trudeau said. ""For the good of all Canadians, the illegal blockades and occupations have to stop, and the borders have to remain open."" The Prime Minister told Parliament that about half of the funding for the demonstrations is being supported by people in the United States. ""These illegal blockades are being heavily supported by individuals in the United States and from elsewhere around the world,"" he said. ""We see that roughly half of the funding that is flowing to the barricaders here is coming from the United States. The goal of all measures, including financial measures in the Emergencies Act, is to deal with the current threat only and to get the situation fully under control."" To invoke powers under the Emergencies Act, the government must propose a motion in the House and Senate explaining why federal officials need the powers and specifying what actions will be taken, then both the House and Senate must confirm the motions, according to CTV.Debate on the House motion was to begin Thursday and a vote will be held soon, said Government House Leader Mark Holland, a member of Trudeau's Liberal Party.Trudeau said invoking the act ""is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting peoples' jobs and restoring faith in our institutions.""Trucks parked on Wellington Street, in front of Parliament Hill, during a demonstration in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday.4 charged with conspiracy to commit murder at Alberta protestWhile the Ottawa shutdown is ongoing and the Manitoba blockade dissolved without confrontation, authorities who ended other border demonstrations earlier this week were met with some resistance.Police in Ontario announced the arrest of up to 30 protesters while clearing out a blockade Sunday in Windsor, near the Ambassador Bridge, a critical link for US and Canadian commerce that connects to Detroit. Ottawa police chief is leaving his post, city officials say amid ongoing protestsPolice seized five protester vehicles Sunday and seven vehicles were towed Saturday, according to Windsor Police Chief Pamela Mizuno. In Coutts, Alberta, police obtained a warrant and searched three trailers Monday associated with a small, organized group within a larger protest at the Alberta-Montana border. More than a dozen firearms, multiple sets of body armor and a large quantity of ammunition and high-capacity magazines were seized, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Four people have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder in connection to the Coutts border blockade, the RCMP said Tuesday. Other charges include possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose and mischief over $5,000, police said. ""Monday's weapons seizure and subsequent arrests speak to the serious criminal activities taking place during this protest and illegal blockade,"" Alberta RCMP Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said in a video statement issued Tuesday.  ""The dangerous, criminal activity occurring away from the TV cameras and social media posts was real and organized, and it could have been deadly for citizens, protesters and officers."" Workers in Michigan could lose up to $51 million in wages this week because of trucker protest, group estimatesNine other people were arrested and charged with possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose and mischief over $5,000. The crossing, which connects Coutts with Sweet Grass, Montana, is now open, Zablocki said.""I am happy to share with Albertans that the border is fully open, traffic is moving through smoothly and all protestors have moved out of the area,"" he said. ""We are maintaining a presence at this time to ensure the border remains a safe passageway for Albertans.""

Rainfall on Tuesday afternoon alone was more than the historical average for the whole of February, according to the Civil Defense of Rio.Floodwaters raced through hillside neighborhoods, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. Brazil's Civil Defense Secretariat said on Tuesday that 269 landslides had been recorded, CNN affiliate CNN Brasil reported. The search for survivors continues.Flood waters swept cars through the city streets.Search and rescue teams on Wednesday were wading through mud, scanning the wreckage for survivors. The National Civil Defense said it had saved 24 people, but that more than 439 people had lost their homes and rescue efforts were ongoing. Read More""The work continues and we will do the possible and the impossible to save lives,"" Rio de Janeiro state governor, Claudio Castro, said Wednesday in a post on Twitter, where he's been sharing updates.A man carries a dog away from an affected area.On Thursday, salesman Luis Felipe de Oliveira was still searching for his missing brother and grandmother. ""They are buried, but we don´t know if they are dead or alive,"" he told CNN. Rescuers are focusing on other homes in the neighborhood where the two lived, he said, so one of his brothers went to the site to dig through the mud. ""I tell myself that I will find them alive. But I am prepared for the worst,"" Oliveira added.Nestled in the hills north of the capital Rio de Janiero, Petropolis, nicknamed the ""Imperial City"" for its popularity among Brazil's monarchy in the 19th century, is known for its palatial architecture, grand theaters and museums. On Wednesday, photos and footage showed swathes of the majestic city in ruins.Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who was in Moscow when the landslides began on Tuesday and then traveled onward to Hungary, is expected to visit Petrópolis on Friday. He said Wednesday that he had spoken to ministers and asked for ""immediate assistance"" to be sent to the victims.Since the 1960s, southern Brazil has experienced an increase in both the number of extreme rain events and the mean amount of rainfall, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This is partly explained by natural variability in weather patterns, but also because of climate change, as well as aerosols and the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere. Average global temperatures are now at least 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than they were before industrialization. Warming of 2C would mean even more intense and frequent of extreme rain events and flooding in southern Brazil, according to the IPCC.Scientists say the world needs to make deep, sustained cuts to greenhouse gases, primarily by transitioning away from fossil fuels, to contain global warming to 1.5C.Brazil has seen a number of natural disasters in recent months.At the beginning of February at least 24 people died after heavy rain battered São Paulo, home to Brazil's financial center, triggering floods and landslides across the southeastern Brazilian state.More than 1,546 families were displaced, according to a statement released by the State Civil Defense, which also said that at least eight children died in the disaster.And at the end of December it was announced that the death toll from floods and heavy rain, which had blighted the Brazilian state of Bahia since November, had risen to 20.Flooding also caused two dams to burst and the displacement of an estimated 62,800 people, state officials say."

This week, they agreed to move out of residential areas and stick to streets directly in front of Canada's national parliament.But supporters have called for the ""Freedom Convoy"" to persist until vaccine mandates and other Covid-19 measures in the country are rescinded.  In a flyer handed out Wednesday in Ottawa, police said they may arrest anyone blocking streets or assisting someone who is doing so.""You must immediately cease further unlawful activity, or you will face charges,"" the statement says.Read MorePolice said anyone coming to Ottawa to join the ongoing demonstrations is breaking the law and could have their vehicle seized. Authorities also said people who participate in the blockades can face fines or have their drivers' licenses suspended.The Children's Aid Society of Ottawa urged demonstrators to make care arrangements for their children in case they are detained or arrested.""If parents and children are separated following police efforts in ending the demonstration in the downtown core, CASO will work to reunite families as soon as possible,"" the statement said. While protesters continue to idle trucks and camp out in downtown Ottawa, other blockades, situated along the Canadian-US border this week, are standing down.The Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced Wednesday the blockade near the border crossing at Emerson will begin clearing out.""The remaining demonstrators will begin to move out of the area and full access to the Emerson border entry will be restored,"" Sgt. Paul Manaigre said.The RCMP will be escorting the remaining vehicles out of the area to ensure a ""safe and orderly departure,"" Manaigre added. ""This is for the safety of everyone involved.""The blockade began on February 10, and at its peak had about 75 vehicles involved in the demonstration, Manaigre said.The Emerson border entry connects to Pembina, North Dakota.Manaigre said no one was charged in the demonstrations, no vehicles were towed, and no injuries occurred. ""It's the perfect solution,"" he said.JUST WATCHEDKey US-Canada border crossing bridge reopens following protestsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKey US-Canada border crossing bridge reopens following protests 01:42The demonstrations at border crossings, in which trucks and vehicles were used to block roadways, in some places for more than two weeks, have left many residents frustrated, local businesses hindered and the federal government enacting unprecedented emergency powers.A vital bridge connecting Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit reopened late Sunday after arrests were made and protesters departed. Highway traffic is also flowing once again through the Coutts checkpoint at the Alberta-Montana border, where police say at least 11 people were arrested and multiple firearms were seized. But truckers demonstrating in the nation's capital remain defiant. Fact check: Strong majority of Canadians oppose convoy protests, poll after poll findsThe presence of the protesters has been an ongoing source of frustration among Ottawans and city officials, who said Tuesday that Police Chief Peter Sloly is leaving his post.In his departure statement, Sloly shared his appreciation for residents and fellow law enforcement and described the situation as a ""difficult journey.""""Since the onset of this demonstration, I have done everything possible to keep this city safe and put an end to this unprecedented and unforeseeable crisis,"" he said, adding he thinks police are now better positioned to ""end this occupation.""Sloly previously noted enforcement during the demonstration has been complex and delicate in part because families are embedded within the protesters. The chief had said repeatedly he did not have enough resources to deal with such a large protest.US truckers are frustrated by more than Covid-19While Ottawa Police Services Board Chair Diane Deans thanked the former chief for his service, she opened a meeting of the board by saying authorities were so far unable to achieve peace in the city. ""The OPS (Ottawa Police Service) has been unable to adequately enforce our laws and our residents continue to be terrorized, it isn't good enough,"" said Deans, adding, ""I have watched in disbelief as this carnival of chaos has been allowed to continue.""Residents have told CNN they were dismayed by the chief's lack of enforcement on their city streets. City officials have said some protesters threatened and harassed locals, including committing racist and homophobic acts, and a hotline was established to better alert authorities of such behavior. Police say they have opened dozens of investigations amid reports of hate crimes, rock throwing and property damage.Trucks and protesters block downtown streets near the Parliament Buildings as a demonstration continues Wednesday in Ottawa, Ontario.Some measures ease while others remainStemming from truck drivers showing their disapproval of a recent mandate requiring them to be fully vaccinated when crossing the US border or face a two-week quarantine, the protest has spiraled for some demonstrators into a wider grievance against all Covid-19 measures, including mask and vaccination requirements.An unvaccinated truck driver died from Covid-19. His mom has a message for protesting Canadian truckersFour in every five Canadians are fully vaccinated, and nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, the government said.While there are no indications the trucker vaccine mandate will be dropped, some modifications to Covid-19 safety measures were announced this week -- though officials have been quick to note the changes are not because of the protests but due to decreasing Covid-19 cases and strong vaccination numbers. Starting February 28, the country will no longer require PCR tests for fully vaccinated travelers and will accept rapid tests, Canada's health minister announced Tuesday. Unvaccinated travelers will still be subjected to testing requirements and a 14-day quarantine.""I am happy to announce these changes today, as I know many of us are looking forward to living with fewer restrictions. However, we must continue to exercise prudence,"" Federal Minister of Health Jean-Yves Duclos said. ""Let me be clear: Our fight against the virus is not over.""Canada eases Covid-19 testing rules for vaccinated travelersIn British Columbia, restaurants, nightclubs, fitness centers, movie theaters and other venues will go back to full capacity by Thursday, according to the provincial government.Ontario plans to drop its vaccine passport requirements and indoor capacity limits on March 1 if the province's Covid-19 hospitalization rates continue to improve, Premier Doug Ford announced Monday. Masking requirements will remain in effect for ""just a little bit longer,"" he said.""Let me be very clear, we're moving in this direction because it's safe to do so,"" Ford said.

Plan A and Plan B each required two holes to be drilled - a small hole first and then a wider one about 26 to 28 inches (65-70 centimeters) in diameter. Golborne said the second pass would progress more slowly than the first pass. Plan A involved using a drill placed directly above the shelter where the miners were holed up. Under Plan B, a hole was drilled at a roughly 80-degree angle into an area of the mine shaft that was used as a mechanical workshop. That distance, engineers estimated, was around 2,034 feet (620 meters). The drill used in Plan C needed to cut through some 1,969 feet (600 meters) of rock and earth. Plan A drill was a Raise Borer Strata 950, usually used for drilling ventilation shafts in mines. Plan B drill was a Schramm T-130, usually used for boring water holes. Plan C drill was a Rig 421 drill, usually used for drilling for oil.

An unprecedented movePrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday he was invoking the Emergencies Act for the first time since it became law in 1988 to blunt the impact of the trucker-inspired protests. The rallies began when a group of truckers moved into Canada's capital on January 29, clogging streets surrounding the Parliament building and elsewhere in downtown Ottawa to protest a new mandate requiring them to be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canadian-US border or face a two-week quarantine.The Canadian protesters aren't just truckers. Here's who has been showing up and what they wantThey have been joined in Ottawa and at border stops and cities across the nation by others who want an end to other Covid-19 mitigation measures, like mask mandates, lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings. But the protesters are a vocal minority. About four in every five Canadians are fully vaccinated and nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, the government said.""These illegal barricades are doing great damage to Canada's economy and to our reputation as a reliable trading partner,"" Freeland said. The blockade at the Ambassador Bridge, which was cleared Sunday, impacted about $390 million worth of commerce a day, the minister said. The combined impact of blockades at border crossings, including those in Alberta and Manitoba, has been $500 million each day, Freeland said. Why the Ambassador Bridge is crucial to two nations' economies""These costs are real. They threaten businesses, big and small,"" Freeland said. ""The Canadian economy needs (truckers) to be doing legitimate work, not to be illegally making us all poorer."" In addition to allowing financial institutions to freeze accounts suspected of funding illegal protests, Canada is also requiring crowdfunding sites and payment service providers used by protesters to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada and report any large suspicious donations -- including digital payments and with cryptocurrencies. Some sites have raised millions of dollars.While the Emergencies Act allows for the use of the military, the government will not take that step, Trudeau said Monday.  The measure can also temporarily suspend citizens' rights to free movement or assembly, but Trudeau said the government is not overriding the Charter of Rights and Freedoms -- a part of the Canadian Constitution that lays out ""rights and freedoms that Canadians believe are necessary in a free and democratic society,"" according to a Canadian government website.""We are not preventing people from exercising their right to protest legally,"" Trudeau said. The law will be limited geographically, in scope and in time, he noted. Ambassador Bridge owner issues 'call to action'The reopening of the Ambassador Bridge was ""a win for Michigan's working families who are just trying to do their jobs and for businesses who can get back to shipping their products and produce,"" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement Monday.The bridge is the busiest land border crossing in North America, linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. It carries nearly 30% of annual trade between Michigan and Canada, Whitmer said. US auto factories disrupted by Canadian trucker rallyThat blockade, which caused supply chain issues for automakers on both sides of the border, ended when Canadian authorities cleared pedestrians and vehicles that had been blocking access to the bridge over the weekend.Whitmer thanked US and Canadian border officials and business leaders for their work in resolving the ordeal and said it was important to ""ensure that this does not happen again.""The company that owns the bridge echoed that sentiment and issued a ""call to action"" to prevent future closures. ""We must join together to come up with an actionable plan that will protect and secure all border crossings in the Canada/U.S. corridor and ensure that this kind of disruption to critical infrastructure will never happen again,"" said Matt Moroun, the chairman of Detroit International Bridge Company.""They are critical pipelines that supply the goods we need to keep our factories going, our neighbors working and our economies thriving."" In Manitoba, the RCMP said Tuesday that protesters are expected to be gone by Wednesday, the result of a resolution reached with the demonstrators.Chief Superintendent Rob Hill said officials were confident protesters would depart and that full access to the Emerson border crossing will be restored.

And the government is taking steps to stop financial support of illegal protests.The trucker-inspired protests have for weeks disturbed residents in Ottawa's downtown and recently impeded traffic flow at crossings at the US border. Opinion: Canadian trucker protests are the latest example of Covid-19 absurdity""This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting peoples' jobs and restoring faith in our institutions,"" Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa, adding that the law will be limited geographically, in scope and in time. Read MoreThe Canadian law, passed in 1988, states, ""For the purposes of this Act, a national emergency is an urgent and critical situation of a temporary nature"" that cannot be effectively dealt with under any other law of Canada.""Trudeau said the government is not overriding the charter of rights and freedoms, nor limiting the right to peaceful assembly. ""We are not preventing people from exercising their right to protest legally,"" he added.The news comes after the Ambassador Bridge -- North America's busiest land border crossing -- reopened Sunday and Ontario, Canada's most populous province, announced plans to loosen pandemic restrictions.For almost a week, protesters blocked the bridge linking Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit -- severing the key trade route and dealing economic blows to both the US and Canada. The bridge reopened Sunday night, allowing ""the free flow of commerce between the Canada and US economies once again,"" the Detroit International Bridge Company said. The leader of Ontario announced the next day he plans to drop the province's vaccine passport requirements on March 1 if its Covid-19 hospitalization rates continue to improve.""The removal of these measures has always been our objective and something we have collectively worked towards for months now,"" Premier Doug Ford announced.""Let me be very clear: We're moving in this direction because it's safe to do so,"" Ford said. ""Today's announcement is not because of what's happening in Ottawa or Windsor but despite it.""Arrests in AlbertaThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Monday it has seized 13 long guns, handguns, multiple sets of body armor, a machete and a large quantity of ammunition and high-capacity magazines connected to a small, organized group within a larger protest at the US border crossing in Coutts, Alberta.The RCMP in Alberta said 11 people were arrested near the border crossing that connects Coutts to Sweet Grass, Montana. ""The group was said to have a willingness to use force against the police if any attempts were made to disrupt the blockade,"" the statement said. ""This resulted in an immediate and complex investigation to determine the extent of the threat and criminal organization.""After obtaining a warrant, police were able to search three trailers early Monday that were associated with the group.The Coutts border crossing is one of several that have been blocked by protesters denouncing Covid-19 mandates.Personal and corporate accounts can now be frozen, finance minister saysThe government is using the Emergencies Act also to go after those who financially support illegal protests, Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland said at the news conference.Freeland said financial institutions are being given the power to suspend or freeze personal or corporate accounts they believe are being used to fund illegal protests.She warned truck owners, for example, that if the vehicle is being used in a blockade, the corporate account can be frozen.The government is taking action on crowd-funding sites and payment providers, requiring them to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada and report any large suspicious donations. Some sites have raised millions of dollars.""We are making these changes because we know that these platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy,"" she said.The protests that have hindered traffic at border crossings has impacted more that $500 million in commerce each day, Freeland said.Much of that was at the Ambassador Bridge, where 30% of trade by road with the United States crosses, she said. That impacted about $390 million a day, Freeland added. The impact at the Coutts crossing is $48 million and at one in Emerson, Manitoba, it has been $73 million.""These costs are real. They threaten businesses big and small, and they threaten the livelihoods of Canadian workers just as we are all working so hard to recover from the economic damage caused by Covid,"" she said.Protesters not just truckers The ""Freedom Convoy"" protesters' grievances stem from Canada's new mandate requiring truckers to either be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canadian-US border or face a two-week quarantine. The protest has attracted support from thousands more Canadians -- even some who are fully vaccinated but say they want all Covid-19 preventative measures dropped. Why the Ambassador Bridge is crucial to two nations' economiesAbout four in every five Canadians are fully vaccinated, Johns Hopkins University data shows. And nearly 90% of the country's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, according to the Canadian government.Among the relaxed restrictions on tap in Ontario are the removal of some event capacity limits as soon as Thursday. Ontario also has a goal to ""lift proof of vaccination requirements for all settings"" on March 1.But Ontario residents must still wear masks ""for just a little bit longer,"" Ford said. ""This is an important layer of protection that will allow us to proceed with our reopening plans.""Canada's capital gets flooded by protestersMembers of the protest convoy have blocked Ottawa's downtown core and impeded border crossings between Alberta and Montana; Manitoba and North Dakota; and British Columbia and Washington state.The Canadian protesters aren't just truckers. Here's who has been showing up and what they wantTruckers and their supporters have gathered in Ottawa since January 29 to rally against mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions on gatherings and other Covid-19 preventative measures.Protesters will remain in the capital city ""for as long as it takes for governments across Canada to end all mandates"" associated with Covid-19, Freedom Convoy organizers said earlier this month.But Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said Sunday that he had reached an agreement with organizers for them to leave residential areas of downtown and restrict their demonstrations to streets directly in front of Canada's national parliament. Residents this month have reported rock throwing, property damage and harassment by protesters. Police said they had opened dozens of investigations, including into alleged hate crimes. Some downtown Ottawa businesses have had to shut down temporarily.Trucks with Canadian flags drive by anti-vaccine mandate and anti-government protesters Saturday in Surrey, British Columbia, near the border with Washington state. American officials worried similar protests could soon erupt in the US -- perhaps near Sunday's Super Bowl in Southern California.

The CNN investigation, published on Tuesday, shed new light onto Moïse's July 7, 2021 killing, including how a secret recording, failed raid and phone records led a stealth team of Haitian investigators to point the finger at Prime Minister Ariel Henry.Multiple law enforcement sources detailed a series of actions that they say connect the Prime Minister to the assassination, including being involved in the plot to kill Moïse and obstructing the subsequent investigation.""These desperate maneuvers constitute a diversion serving to confuse the tracks of the investigation, further weaken the security situation and further destabilize the country, thus aggravating the suffering of the population,"" Jean Victor Généus, the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Culture, said through a diplomatic letter dated Thursday.CNN also obtained exclusive audio of Judge Garry Orélien, the former judge in the assassination case, speaking about Henry. Read MoreHaitian Prime Minister involved in planning the President's assassination, says judge who oversaw case In that recording, Orélien said, ""Ariel (Henry) is connected and friends with the mastermind of the assassination. They planned it with him. Ariel is a prime suspect of Jovenel Moïse's assassination, and he knows it.""CNN verified the recording, taken in fall 2021, by comparing it to other known recordings of Orélien and through extensive conversations CNN has had with him, as well as from voice messages. Orélien did not know he was being recorded.The months-long investigation found that Orélien believes Henry is complicit in the assassination and cover-up, but that he was unable to prosecute him.""Do you think I can touch Ariel (Henry) now? How can I do that? I won't be able to give (any order to indict him), it won't see the light of day,"" Orélien said in the recording.Généus said in Thursday's letter that Orélien ""categorically rejects these lies."" ""I don't recall talking to anyone about the case in great detail,"" Orélien told CNN when asked about the recording. ""Lots of people are trying to influence the case and I will not play their game.""The official case looking into the assassination is still proceeding in Haiti, but practically, it is all but dead. It has produced no new arrests, no new suspects or any evidence since August. Technically, it is still open.The US Justice Department has ramped up its own investigation into the assassination, recently extraditing and charging two top suspects in the case for allegedly planning the assassination on US soil. According to the federal complaint, one of the men provided the arms and ammunition to kill Haiti's President.Two Haitian investigators told CNN they believe that if their US counterparts keep digging, the Prime Minister will also emerge as a key suspect."

Noncompliance could bring a year in prison and a $100,000 fine, Doug Ford said, adding authorities would consider taking away personal and commercial licenses with anyone who is not complying. The protests were sparked by truckers who oppose Canada's new rule requiring them to be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canadian-US border or face a two-week quarantine. Their ""Freedom Convoy"" has since drawn supporters resisting other Covid-19 preventative measures, including mask mandates, lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings.Demonstrators have also used semitrailers and sometimes farm equipment to block key Canadian-US access points at Emerson, Manitoba, and Pembina, North Dakota, as well as at the Coutts access point between Alberta and Montana.

Possible solutions include persuading protesters to disburse voluntarily; the government giving into demands; and police removing the protesters. Military force is considered highly unlikely as Canada's armed forces are not a police force and they ""are not involved in law enforcement in this situation,"" Defense Minister Anita Anand told CNN.The Trudeau government will send more officers to protests across the country, saying Thursday the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's national police force, continues to show decisive action.""The RCMP are going to be sending additional reinforcements to Ottawa. I also can advise that the RCMP will be sending reinforcements to Windsor and in addition to that the RCMP have added additional resources at Coutts, in Alberta,"" said Marco Mendicino, Canada's public safety minister.""Our top priority is to make sure that these illegal blockades end,"" he said.More demonstrators expected in Canada's capitalMeanwhile in Ottawa, there have been 25 arrests since protests began about two weeks ago and more than 1,500 tickets have been issued for traffic, noise and other violations, police said on their website.A company that could move the trucks also has been threatened, said the city's police chief, Peter Sloly.The Canadian trucker protest is in its second week. This is how we got here""At least one of the major tow trucks (company) that would have been able to supply us with the logistics to tow illegal vehicles and to a significant degree reduce the size of the demonstrations has been threatened themselves,"" he said. ""They have been threatened through some sophisticated online activities and direct threats to harm to their employees and their business.""Authorities might try other options, Sloly said, adding,""All options are on the table."" A criminal investigation into the threats is underway, Sloly said.Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said he expects to see more demonstrators in Canada's capital this weekend, telling CNN Friday there were about 400 trucks already stationed in and around downtown. ""People have had their peace and quiet disrupted for almost two weeks now,"" Watson said.""It's completely unacceptable,"" the mayor added.

americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/americas/brazil-vaccine-campaign-stumbles-bolsonaro-intl-cmd/index.html,Brazil's Covid-19 vaccination drive stumbles as Bolsonaro's disinformation campaign lingers ,"By Camilo Rocha, Rodrigo Pedroso and Marcia Reverdosa, CNN","Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)At the beginning of 2021, hospitals in Brazil's Amazonas state were in a critical state, with ICUs filled to capacity and Covid-19 patients fighting for their lives. ""There were a lot of young people in the last wave getting worse too fast. We had 33- to 40-year-old patients in the ICU. And we had a bigger limitation of medical supplies. Every day we had a shortage of some kind,"" said Dr. Luan Matos de Menezes, an ICU doctor at the Delfina Aziz Hospital in the regional capital of Manaus. Today, it feels like déjà vu. As the Omicron coronavirus variant continues to tear through the country at rapid pace, the hospital's ICU is once again overwhelmed. But one thing is different, Menezes says. This time, he feels that many of those patients are making a choice. Read MoreAlthough more than 86% of the adult population of Brazil is now fully vaccinated, take-up for boosters has been slow, along with lower rates for younger ages. Some infectious disease experts attribute this to the lingering effects of a disinformation campaign in which the country's leadership has played a role. Without that protection, those Brazilians have been vulnerable to the latest wave of Omicron infections sweeping the country.An ICU nurse in Marica, Brazil tends to a Covid-19 patient in January. Menezes, who has been working at the hospital throughout the pandemic, says it is harder to have sympathy for these Covid patients. That's because the majority of the people who are now ending up in the ICU are either unvaccinated or are only partially vaccinated -- even though the vaccines have been available to them for months. More than 80% of people hospitalized with Covid-19 across four Brazilian regional capitals -- Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Manaus and Brasilia -- are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to local government figures. And in Manaus, where Menezes works, nine in 10 people admitted to hospital are not fully vaccinated. ""These are the people who opted not to vaccinate,"" Menezes said. Menezes also told CNN that many of the unvaccinated patients, who are often already seriously ill when they arrive to the hospital, ask for the vaccine when they are admitted. Brazil's parents want their kids vaccinated against Covid. Bolsonaro has tried to stop itBut by that point, it is too late. Brazil has already approaching 640,000 deaths due to the pandemic -- the second highest national toll in the world, according to data by Johns Hopkins University. And this year, the country continues to report record daily Covid-19 cases and deaths. On February 3, the number of daily deaths surpassed 1,000 for the first time since August 2021, according to data from the health ministry. ""Those of us who are at the Covid frontline are seeing a lot of people dying because they did not vaccinate,"" said Menezes, who attributes that vaccine hesitancy to ""a lot of false information being spread"" regarding the vaccines' efficacy and safety. Many public health officials are looking at Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro speaks in Brasilia in November 2021.Bolsonaro, who says he is unvaccinated, has been widely criticized at home and abroad for playing down the severity of the virus, with a longstanding campaign to discredit vaccines under his leadership. Despite this, many Brazilians have taken up the vaccine.But hesitancy still persists, now reflected in booster shot rates and sluggish uptake rates in younger age groups. Only 23% of Brazilians ages 12 and older have received their booster dose so far, compared with 94% who have gotten at least one dose. In younger age groups, those rates drop even lower. Just 10% of children ages 5-11 have gotten the vaccine. They have been eligible to do so since January 17. But some of Bolsonaro's allies appear set to derail that campaign. On January 21, Marcelo Queiroga, Brazil's health minister, and Damares Alves, minister for women and families, visited a family in Sao Paulo state whose child had died of cardiac arrest hours after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine in what some say was an attempt to discredit the vaccine. Sao Paulo's State Health Secretary said that the child had a rare disease and that her death was not linked to the vaccine. That same week, Queiroga had falsely claimed that thousands of people had died from adverse reactions caused by the vaccines -- directly contradicting his government's own data. He later said that those comments were taken out of context by the media. But those comments were already out in the public realm. Bolsonaro supporters demonstrate against Covid-19 vaccines outside the Pan American Health Organization headquarters in Brasilia on January 4.Esther Solano, professor of international relations at Sao Paulo University, told CNN that the officials are intentionally creating confusion around vaccines. ""People feel very lost, they don't know what is true and what is not. It is a strategy of confusion that greatly increases people's distrust of institutions and the press about what is happening,"" Solano said. Dr. Raquel Stucchi, an infectious disease expert and professor at Unicamp University told CNN that Bolsonaro's government had delivered ""repeated messages questioning efficacy and security"" of Covid-19 vaccines, including Bolsonaro himself, who raised the question as to why ""one has to take three doses if before two were enough."" Vaccine boosters and series of doses in vaccines are not unusual. Many vaccines require multiple doses to achieve full immunity, including the polio vaccine, which requires four doses, or the hepatitis vaccine, which requires three. These vaccines are a series, meaning that the second, third or fourth doses are needed to achieve full protection. Dr. Isabella Ballalai, a pediatrician and vice president of the Brazilian Society of Immunizations, told CNN that Brazilian authorities should be concentrating on positive messaging around vaccines -- and making it clear that those who are being hospitalized are largely either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Sarah Santos Costa receives a dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on January 17, 2022, as part of the first group of children under 12 to get the vaccine. 
Ballalai cited robust public health messaging in the UK and the US as an example. Brazil's public health messaging, she said, has been notably weak, with Bolsonaro and his health minister's vaccine rhetoric only adding to the problem. As Omicron first began to surge through the country, Bolsonaro claimed that it ""hadn't killed anyone."" Such language -- that Omicron is less harmful -- could be contributing to people deciding not to get their booster doses, Stucchi said. While studies have concluded that the Omicron variant is less likely to cause severe disease and hospitalization compared to the Delta variant, the problem, she said, is that people aren't connecting the idea that the vaccines themselves are playing a part in ensuring that infections don't develop into more serious cases. ""People assume that they don't need to worry much about vaccination anymore. (But) what we know is that Omicron is lighter because of vaccination,"" she said. Ballalai is urging the country's leaders to send clear and fact-based messaging. It's the only way to stop the cycle, she said, and to keep future generations safe. ""If you don't talk about it, Brazilians don't see the risk. We no longer have the natural demand we saw in the 90s, where everyone looked for a vaccine -- so as to not let their children die,"" she said. "
americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/americas/canada-covid-protest-explainer/index.html,The Canadian protesters aren't just truckers. Here's who has been showing up and what they want,"By Paula Newton, CNN","Ottawa (CNN)A massive protest by Canadian truckers and others against Covid-19 mandates has been growing for weeks, crippling three US border crossings and downtown Ottawa -- with no end in sight. So, why are the demonstrations happening now? What exactly are they about? And what's being done to address them? Here are some key questions and answers about Canada's Covid-19 protests.What are truckers protesting in Canada?Thousands of truckers are participating in the so-called ""Freedom Convoy,"" fighting a vaccine mandate that is forcing all Canadian truckers crossing the US-Canadian border to be fully vaccinated or face quarantine in their homes for two weeks when they return.The rule went into effect in mid-January in Canada and January 22 in the United States. The US Department of Homeland Security now requires noncitizens entering the United States via border crossings or ferry terminals along the US northern and southern borders be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Read MoreA man takes part in a Freedom Convoy protest in Ottawa on February 2.Before this mandate, truckers were exempted from the vaccine requirement and permitted to cross the border, at times testing for Covid-19, even during the 18-month period that the border was closed to nonessential traffic. Truckers were considered vital to keeping supply chains functioning normally. Nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, according to the Canadian government. So, the protesting truckers represent a ""small, fringe minority,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, adding early on that his government did not expect the vaccine mandate to significantly affect supply chains.How have the protests evolved?The Freedom Convoy of truckers began its protest in January in Canada's western provinces, with the goal of reaching the nation's capital, Ottawa, and continuing to protest until the vaccine mandate was lifted. On its cross-country journey, the protest has attracted support from thousands more Canadians, even some who are fully vaccinated, who say they want all Covid-19 preventative measures dropped, including mask mandates, lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings.A large, noisy convoy, including hundreds of trucks and other vehicles, descended January 29 on Ottawa. Since then, they have snarled traffic and honked often and loudly. Protesters in more than 60 vehicles also disrupted traffic at Ottawa International Airport on Thursday, circling the arrivals and departure terminals, airport officials said. JUST WATCHEDLoud trucker protest disrupts OttawaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLoud trucker protest disrupts Ottawa 03:03In several other large Canadian cities and towns, protest crowds emerged over the first weekend of February with hundreds of trucks and thousands of protesters. Rallies also took place in Toronto, Quebec City, Vancouver and Winnipeg.Meantime, Friday marked the fifth day protesters impeded access to the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit and Windsor, Ontario -- the busiest international crossing in North America.In addition, a mix of semi-trailers and farm equipment shut down the border crossing connecting Emerson, Manitoba, and Pembina, North Dakota, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Manitoba. The Coutts access point between Alberta and Montana has also been blocked.Similar protests soon could erupt in the United States, including around Sunday's Super Bowl in Southern California, American officials warn. Right-wing media outlets have raised the prospect of like-minded rallies in the US and offered positive coverage of those in Canada.What do the protesters want?Protesters will remain in Ottawa ""for as long as it takes for governments across Canada to end all mandates"" associated with Covid-19, Freedom Convoy organizers said last week in a statement. Some want Trudeau to speak with them and hear their opposition to the mandates and restrictions, those protesters told CNN. Trudeau has no intention of meeting with protesters, who hold views ""unacceptable"" to most Canadians, he has said. What has the impact been on Canadians?The blockades have slowed the movement of goods and caused production problems at car manufacturing plants along the border. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have all announced auto production issues in Canada.The Ambassador Bridge ""is too essential to both of our national economies, and ... puts a lot of bread on the table for our families on both sides of the border,"" Windsor, Ontario, Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN this week. In Ottawa, residents and service providers in the downtown core feel like hostages in a city under siege, they've told CNN. Most businesses in the area have been forced to close; they include a large mall next to the protest site.People protest Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Ottawa on February 5.Dozens of trucks remain in Ottawa's downtown core in what local officials have described as an ""occupation."" The police chief calls it ""unlawful,"" as property damage, thefts and mischief have been reported, along with hundreds of alleged hate crimes. Some 1,000 calls related to the demonstration have been received, plus 25 arrests made and more than 1,500 traffic and other tickets issued, police said Thursday.A judge this week signed a temporary injunction that prevents protesters in Ottawa from using horns during their demonstrations, court documents show. In Windsor, Dilkens secured a court injunction Friday to help put an end to the blockade of the Ambassador Bridge. The injunction, which will give police more power to end the ongoing protest takes effect this evening after giving protesters an opportunity to clear the area, Chief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz said.At one point during the hearing, when responding to counsel representing the protesters, Chief Justice Morawetz said the protesters demands for freedom are resulting in the direct denial of freedom for many others in society. ""We're dealing with millions of dollars of damage each and every day,"" he said. ""If they refuse to leave, then police will have operational plans identified, we have resources that have come here from across the province of Ontario and from across Canada with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and one by one we'll start towing the cars if required,"" Dilkens said.People hold signs and wave flags along Wellington Street in front of Parliament Hill on February 5 as part of the Freedom Convoy protest.What has PM Justin Trudeau said about all this?Trudeau, who is fully vaccinated and boosted, has said the protesters do not represent the vast majority of Canadians, about 80% of whom have opted to get fully vaccinated. Most believe public health restrictions save lives, the Prime Minister has said. He implored protesters parked in trucks right outside the parliament building Monday to end their demonstration. Crowds of demonstrators join rallies across Canada as Covid-19 trucker protests spread""Individuals are trying to blockade our economy, our democracy and our fellow citizens' daily lives. It has to stop,"" Trudeau said during an emergency debate in Ottawa that marked his first public appearance since isolating after he and some members of his family contracted the coronavirus.The Prime Minister acknowledged that protesters have a right to voice their concerns but said residents don't deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods.""This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians, but Canadians know the way to get through it is continuing to listen to science, continuing to lean on each other, continuing to be there for each other,"" Trudeau said after underscoring that Canadians are tired of Covid-19 health restrictions. By Thursday, the Prime Minister was employing stronger language in a series of tweets: ""The illegal blockades and occupations happening across the country ... (are) harming the communities they're taking place in -- and they're hurting jobs, businesses, and our country's economy.""Trudeau had spoken with Windsor's mayor ""about the illegal blockade of the Ambassador Bridge ... because it is causing real harm to workers and economies on both sides of the border,"" he tweeted. He'd also spoken with opposition party leaders, asking all lawmakers to ""denounce these illegal acts -- and to call for an end to these blockades.""Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listens to a question from the media availability on January 31.About 80% of Canadians are vaccinated. Why so much angst now?Almost 4 of every 5 Canadians are vaccinated, according to the Canadian government. However, provincial governments and the federal government have enforced various vaccine mandates, stoking ire among those politically opposed and fatigue among others as the pandemic hits its two-year mark.At the federal and provincial level, Canada has enforced some of the strictest Covid-19 measures in the world, with widespread mask mandates and restrictions on the size of gatherings, not only at large events and restaurants but also in private homes.Traveling to Canada during Covid-19: What you need to know before you goA vocal minority of Canadians says they agree with the truckers' protest, saying is it time to drop most Covid-19 restrictions. With so many Canadians complying for so long with vaccine and mask mandates and other Covid-19 measures, some say public health officials and government leaders are now going too far.As one couple who said they are fully vaccinated feel they did their part and now they want to move on, they told CNN.Had Canadians staged serious protests over Covid-19 rules before this?Various smaller protests took place across the country against health measures and mandates in 2020 and 2021. However, this is the largest and most widespread protest of its kind to date during the pandemic.What Covid-19 rules are in place for Canadians who are not truckers?Several provinces are beginning to drop some mitigation measures and allow the reopening of restaurant dining rooms, theaters, cinemas and gyms, albeit with capacity restrictions.Decisions about most of these health restrictions and how and when to ease them are determined not by the Trudeau government but by individual provinces.There is still a federal vaccine mandate for passengers traveling by air domestically or internationally. In addition, all federal public servants are required to be fully vaccinated as a condition of employment.How might the Covid-19 protests end?Possible solutions include persuading protesters to disburse voluntarily; the government giving into demands; and police removing the protesters. Military force is considered highly unlikely as Canada's armed forces are not a police force and they ""are not involved in law enforcement in this situation,"" Defense Minister Anita Anand told CNN.They are protesting Covid restrictions and support is growing. This is what could happen in the Canada protests nextThe Trudeau government will send more officers to protests across the country, saying Thursday the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's national police force, continues to show decisive action.""The RCMP are going to be sending additional reinforcements to Ottawa. I also can advise that the RCMP will be sending reinforcements to Windsor and in addition to that the RCMP have added additional resources at Coutts, in Alberta,"" said Marco Mendicino, Canada's public safety minister.""Our top priority is to make sure that these illegal blockades end,"" he said.CNN's Sharif Paget contributed to this report."
americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/americas/birds-brains-climate-change-scn/index.html,How birds are adapting to climate crisis,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. (CNN)Thousands of birds die each spring and fall when they collide with Chicago's skyscrapers, which lie on a major migration path between Canada and Latin America. But the birds don't die in vain. Since the 1970s, many of them have been collected from the street and cataloged by the city's Field Museum. This unique and detailed set of data has been a scientific windfall, revealing that North American migratory birds appear to be shrinking in response to climate change. A new study of this data has highlighted an important nuance in this trend: Birds that have bigger brains, relative to their body size, are not shrinking as much as their smaller-brained counterparts.Climate change could be making birds shrink in size, study findsThe study is the first to identify a potential link between cognition and animal response to human-made climate change, according to the researchers from Washington University in St. Louis.""As temperatures warm, body sizes are decreasing,"" said Justin Baldwin, a doctoral student at Washington University and author of the study that published this week in the journal Ecology Letters, in a news release. ""But larger-brained species are declining less strongly than small-brained species.""Since the 1970s, migratory birds that died after colliding with Chicago buildings have been collected and cataloged by the Field Museum. The data set is showing how birds are affected by climate change. Read MoreRelative brain size is often considered an indicator of behavioral flexibility in birds, according to the research. The idea is controversial when it's applied to some other animals, Baldwin said, but it works for birds.""Relative brain size correlates with increased learning ability, increased memory, longer lifespans and more stable population dynamics,"" Baldwin said.""In this case, a bigger-brained species of bird might be able to reduce its exposure to warming temperatures by seeking out microhabitats with cooler temperatures, for example,"" he said.The climate crisis is messing with birds' body shapesThe researchers analyzed information from 70,000 birds that died when they collided with buildings in Chicago between 1978 and 2016. They added brain volume measurements and life-span data for 49 of the 52 species in the database.Birds that had big brains, relative to their bodies such as the song sparrow and other New World sparrows, had body-size reductions that were only about one-third of those observed for birds with smaller brains, the study found. Wood warblers (Parulidae) tended to have smaller brains and tended to shrink more. ""The authors from that amazing study shared their raw data ... which allowed us to add to it and discover more,"" Baldwin said via email.A Blackburnian warbler, pictured here, was another of the species of smaller-brained birds that were more strongly affected by climate change.  Shape-shifters It's not known exactly why birds are shrinking in size. Larger body size helps animals in cold places stay warm, while a smaller body retains less heat. Bird wingspans may have increased to compensate for smaller bodies that produce less energy for the incredibly long distances traveled during migration, researchers have also found.Similarly, other research has found that some animals are developing larger beaks, legs and ears that allow them to better regulate body temperature as the planet gets hotter. While most of the morphological changes have been in birds, bats and shrews have also been affected. Climate change has even altered human bodies.Animals are 'shape shifting' in response to climate changeHowever, downsizing comes at a potential cost for a bird, with an increased risk of falling prey to predators or making it harder to compete for resources with other bird species, said study coauthor Carlos Botero, assistant professor of biology at Washington University, in the statement. It's in this context that having a larger brain may offer alternatives that are not available to small-brained species, he said. ""One of the first things that jumps out to me from these findings is that we can already see that climate change is having a disproportionate effect on species that have less capacity to deal with environmental change through their behavior,"" Botero said.""This doesn't mean that climate change is not affecting brainy birds ... or that brainy birds are going to do just fine. What our findings suggest is that climate change can have a much stronger effect on the less-brainy birds."""
americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/americas/canada-covid-protests-outcome-explainer/index.html,They are protesting Covid restrictions and support is growing. This is what could happen in the Canada protests next,"By Paula Newton, CNN"," (CNN)For two weeks now, Freedom Convoy protesters in Canada have managed to frustrate both law enforcement and political leaders with their unyielding protests against Covid-19 restrictions. Police forces across the country have expressed their reluctance to move in swiftly, saying they prefer to avoid confrontation. The 'Freedom Convoy' started as a truckers' protest by drivers who were fighting vaccine mandates in both Canada and the US. But during the convoy's cross-country journey, it attracted support from many Canadians who say they are fed up with all Covid-19 health restrictions. By the time the convoy arrived in Ottawa, hundreds of drivers and their rigs joined thousands of other protesters in cars and on foot to demand changes to the way the government was handling Covid-19.And protesters' demands have escalated, not just insisting that vaccine mandates be lifted for everyone, but calling for an opening to all businesses including restaurants and gyms, dropping capacity limits at large events and eliminating mask mandates -- especially in schools. As the protests have dragged on, officials at every level of government say they now pose a threat to public security and the economy. Many leaders have demanded the protests cease, but few of those words have been met with concrete action. Read MoreHere are some political and legal scenarios that could play out:  Give peace a chance -- convince protesters to leave voluntarily This is the preferred choice for law enforcement officials who say they recognize Canadians' right to protest. Police in Windsor, Ottawa, and Alberta have stated that they have tried to keep lines of communication open to protest organizers and individual activists, trying to convince them to leave voluntarily. This has had limited success, with protesters bolstered by both messages of support online and material support on the ground with money and supplies. On Thursday, Ottawa police reported that nearly two dozen trucks had been voluntarily removed from two different protest sites. But hundreds remain, still blocking city streets. Access to three US-Canada border crossings cut off by trucker protest blockadesAnd negotiations at border protests have had very limited success, especially in Alberta, where communication efforts seem to have hardened the position of protesters.CNN has spoken to some truckers who say they might consider leaving if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would only speak to them directly about their concerns.""These gentlemen, these guys over in that building and they can just come out and show some respect and you know, at least talk to us,"" said a driver who identified himself as Doran, parked in front of Canada's parliament.Even Ottawa's police chief, Peter Sloly, indicated in the early days of protests that he did not think police were best suited to resolve the situation and that a political solution might be the only effective way to end the protests. Governments give in to protesters' demandsThis is perhaps the least likely of all scenarios. Police and political leaders say it would set a dangerous precedent to give in to ""angry crowds,"" in the words of the prime minister. Several provinces, including Saskatchewan, Alberta and Ontario, have announced in recent days that they will drop some restrictions.Saskatchewan is making changes the most dramatically and quickly, by eliminating its vaccine passport system, dropping mask mandates and reporting Covid-19 cases weekly instead of daily. Alberta is also dropping its mask mandate for children and getting rid of its vaccine passport program.Ontario recently opened restaurant dining rooms and has restored most sporting activities for children and adults.These decisions, however, are unconnected to the protests given that those governments have consistently said that their goal is to lift Covid-19 restrictions as soon as cases and hospitalizations drop.Protesters in Ottawa have also indicated to CNN that they will not be affected by a piecemeal approach to lifting restrictions. They are demanding a nationwide rollback of all Covid-19 health measures. Protestors against Covid-19 vaccine mandates block the roadway at the Ambassador Bridge border crossing in Windsor, Ontario, on February 9, 2022.Authorities remove trucks and cars from protest sitesOttawa officials have been pursuing vehicle-removal options for days, but they have towed very few cars, let alone trucks. They say their efforts are frustrated by tow truck drivers and companies who fear damage to their businesses or worse, a violent confrontation. Ottawa police say they are actively investigating reports that tow truck operators have been threatened and intimidated. Police say they do have some towing capacity but not enough to move a substantial amount of trucks from protest sites without help from private tow truck companies. Ottawa police say they have issued more than 1,700 tickets, and fines for city infractions have in some cases been doubled or tripled.City and provincial officials, responsible for insurance and licensing, also say they are looking to step up enforcement with infractions for parking, insurance and license violations, but this too could take weeks to have any effect. Police forcibly remove protestersLaw enforcement and politicians have been trying to avoid this scenario, fearing both protesters and officers could get hurt. Not only does this risk escalating tensions further and potentially inciting more angry protesters to hit the streets in other parts of the country, but it would require many more officers than are currently available. US auto factories disrupted by Canadian trucker rallyOttawa's mayor, Jim Watson, sent a letter to the prime minister and premier of Ontario asking for reinforcements of 1,800 officers, including administration staff.In a letter provided to the media, Watson writes, ""We must do everything in our power to take back the streets of Ottawa.""The Trudeau government says it continues to dispatch more officers with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to several protest sites, but Ottawa's request for 1,800 extra officers are unlikely to materialize soon, if ever. Ottawa police say they have made 25 arrests to date. Arresting and forcibly removing protesters, however, may be an option that police consider. ""There will be accountability for any unlawful criminal activities that occur in this city in relation to this demonstration,"" said Sloly, Ottawa's police chief, during a Thursday press conference.However, political leaders are aware of the risks of this strategy.""I know many are just saying have the police go in there and move everyone out and restore law and order. And that's sensibly what we all want to see happen,"" Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN in an interview Wednesday. ""The problem is you have a number of folks who are looking for confrontation. You have people who have expressed themselves in the media saying that they believe this is a cause that they are willing to die for.""Use the military to restore orderThis is not only the least preferred option but highly unlikely. Last week, after Sloly suggested it might take the military to resolve protests, he was met with stiff resistance from the federal government. Through a spokesman, Defense Minister Anita Anand told CNN that Canada's armed forces are not a police force and that they ""are not involved in law enforcement in this situation."" Trudeau elaborated further last week, saying, ""One has to be very, very cautious before deploying military forces in situations engaging Canadians. It is not something that anyone should enter in lightly.""Under Canada's Defense Act, a province may request that, ""where a riot or disturbance occurs or is considered as likely to occur,"" the attorney general of the province can request the services of the military ""to be called out on service in aid of the civil power.""

""Our top priority is to make sure that these illegal blockades end.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said late Thursday the blockades were ""hurting jobs, businesses, and our country's economy."" For two weeks now, the trucks have blockaded the downtown core of Ottawa, the capital of Canada. In recent days, demonstrators have parked their bulky vehicles in the middle of critical roadways between Canada and the US.Read MoreThursday marked the fourth day protesters impeded access to the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit and Windsor -- the busiest international crossing in North America. Secondly, a mix of semi-trailers and farm equipment shut down the border crossing connecting Emerson, Manitoba, and Pembina, North Dakota, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Manitoba. And thirdly, the Coutts access point between Alberta and Montana has also been blocked.

The protests were ignited by truckers who oppose the nation's new rule that requires them to be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canada-US border or face a two-week quarantine. Their ""Freedom Convoy"" has since drawn others who are resisting Covid-19 preventative measures, including mask mandates, lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings.""I want all these mandates gone, and I'm not leaving until all the mandates are gone. So, I am here for the long haul,"" Dylan Friesen, a protester in Ottawa, told CNN on Wednesday. ""They can try get rid of us, but we're not leaving.""But officials are taking legal steps to remove the demonstrations. How officials are responding The blockades have slowed the movement of goods and caused production issues at a number of car manufacturing plants along the border. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis all announced production issues due to the blockade.Further, about 60 to 70 vehicles were attempting to disrupt traffic at Ottawa International Airport on Thursday by circling the arrivals and departure terminals, the airport said in a statement. Videos on social media showed a handful of vehicles driving around near a street close to the airport carrying Canadian flags and honking.The Canadian trucker protest is in its second week. This is how we got hereThe mayor of Windsor, Ontario, told CNN on Thursday that city leaders will be in court Friday to seek an injunction against the protestors.  If the protestors are ""unwilling to move on,"" the mayor said tow trucks and equipment would be brought in to help ""move the vehicles out of the way"" to reopen the border crossing. ""Because it is too essential to both of our national economies, and the livelihood of this border crossing puts, the importance of this border crossing puts a lot of bread on the table for our families on both sides of the border,"" Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN's Laura Coates. And if the protesters don't want to leave, the injunction -- if granted-- will expand police's authority on how they may respond, he explained.   ""I get that this injunction would be a single piece of paper, but it gives police more weight in the actions that they are prepared to take, and they will do what is operationally required to move people out.""Trudeau said Thursday he spoke with Dilkens to help contain the situation ""because it is causing real harm to workers and economies on both sides of the border.""Still, Dilkens acknowledged resolving the standoff is a delicate operation. Forcibly removing the truckers could cause even more problems. ""It's very frustrating because people just want us to go in and flush everyone out, and there's a real threat of violence here. We've seen protesters come out with tire irons when the police attempted to tow a car. It could escalate very, very quickly,"" he said.""At the same time, going in and moving out 100 or 200 protesters -- well, we could probably do that. What we don't want to see happen is have 300 more show up tomorrow to replace the ones that were moved out. So, police are trying to negotiate.""Ottawa police said on their website that there have been 25 arrests since protests began about two weeks ago and more than 1,500 tickets have been issued for traffic, noise and other violations.Plus, the city's police chief Peter Sloly said a company that could move the trucks has been threatened.""At least one of the major tow trucks (company) that would have been able to supply us with the logistics to tow illegal vehicles and to a significant degree reduce the size of the demonstrations has been threatened themselves,"" he said. ""They have been threatened through some sophisticated online activities and direct threats to harm to their employees and their business.""He added that authorities might try other options.""We are considering other methods that may allow us to not need to use tow trucks to the extent we initially thought,"" he said. ""All options are on the table.""A criminal investigation into the threats is underway, Sloly said.Similar protests could take place on the other side of the border. American officials are warning that rallies soon could happen in the United States, where right-wing media outlets have raised that prospect and offered positive coverage of the protests. Sunday's Super Bowl in Southern California could draw such crowds, the officials said.What the protesters are demandingJUST WATCHEDSmall group of Canadian protesters get big support from US conservatives ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSmall group of Canadian protesters get big support from US conservatives  04:48The protesting truckers represent a vocal minority among their profession and fellow citizens.

Nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, according to the government.Friesen, the protesting trucker, was let go from a job at a transport company in Ontario for not taking the Covid-19 vaccine, he explained.

""There are folks here protesting government, like you'd see at a G-7 or G-20 protest. There are folks that are protesting climate change initiatives, and there are some folks who protesting vaccine mandates.""Meanwhile, officials are pressing demonstrators to stop blocking the critical pathways.

As she watches the crowds of truckers protest vaccine mandates across Canada, she wants to tell them about her son who died from Covid-19.David Mitchell, 70, was a veteran trucker before he died on October 15, Makins said. She says her son was not vaccinated.""It's a horrible thing to watch somebody die of this disease,"" Makins, who lives in a small Ontario town, told CNN on Tuesday. ""I'm hoping (these truckers) can hear what I have to say and how bad Covid can be and maybe save somebody in their family or even themselves.""The Canadian trucker protest is in its second week. This is how we got hereThousands of Canadian truckers are in their second week of protests against a mandate requiring drivers entering Canada to be fully vaccinated or face testing and quarantine requirements. The group also opposes other restrictions, like mask mandates and Covid-19 lockdowns. The protests stemmed from the ""Freedom Convoy"" of truckers, which traversed the country before arriving in Ottawa, crippling the capital city.Read MoreCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said these protesters represent a ""small, fringe minority."" Nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, according to the government. 'Now all of my children are gone'David Mitchell battled Covid-19 for weeks. After he was put on a ventilator, he never responded to his family again.Mitchell was sick in bed for days before he was first taken to the hospital, Makins said. He was released after some testing.""He looked very ill to me,"" Makins said. ""He was in bed in a great deal of pain and couldn't even reach for his cell phone.""His condition didn't improve even a week later. On September 18, he was having difficulty breathing and moaning in pain, Makins said. He was readmitted to the hospital and immediately put on a ventilator, she said.Mitchell was given paralytics, which are used to prevent patients from moving while on a ventilator. He could not even move his eyes or hands, Makin recalled, in tears.""I spent many, many days and nights with his children at the hospital,"" Makins said. ""I stayed overnight as well and never, ever was able to get any response from him.""When the family decided to take him off the ventilator, Mitchell died within minutes, with his mother and loved ones holding his hand.Makins lost her last surviving child that day. Mitchell was Makins' oldest child; she lost her son Bruce in 2020 and her daughter Jane in 2010, both to cancer.""Now my children are all gone,"" she said. ""It's sort of the wrong way around. It's not the way it's supposed to be.""The Mitchell family is pictured here together about 15 years ago, David (right) sits with his sister Jane, mother Marg and brother Bruce.Mitchell leaves behind two sons, a daughter and five grandchildren.

""He knew that he should get it, but he just didn't get around to doing it.""Mitchell worked a lot, driving across Canada and sleeping in his rig. He often brought his dog, Bull, along for the ride, his mom said.Marg Makins hopes unvaccinated Canadian truckers will hear her message and get vaccinated.His fellow truckers called him a legend, Makins said. Mitchell became a trucker when he was around 19 and was still working at age 70, until he fell ill, she added.""He was very likable. Wasn't very good with the dollar. He spent everything (or) gave it away if he couldn't spend it on himself,"" Makins said. ""He was funny, curious, always had a joke.""Canadian protesters block the busiest international crossing in North America as tensions ramp up over Covid-19 rulesMakins' entire family was vaccinated, except for Mitchell and one of his sons, she said. Makins has received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and a booster.Makins said she does not understand why some truckers are refusing the vaccine. The situation is starting to ""anger"" her. ""They're shutting down the economy of our country and (the United States),"" Makins said. ""It is really disruptive. All kinds of people, nobody can go to work or use those roads. Trucks can't get through with their cargoes, so it's time they went home.""She added: ""Freedoms are privileges.""Makins comes from a long line of truckers. Her father owned a trucking transport company.

Now a judge has temporarily banned some from honking their horns,"By Paula Newton, Aya Elamroussi and Paul P. Murphy, CNN"," (CNN)Tensions stemming from protests spearheaded by Canadian truck drivers over the country's Covid-19 mandates have been simmering in recent weeks, so much so that traffic at key US transit points has ground to a stop and a judge has temporarily banned demonstrators in the nation's capital from using horns. For nearly two weeks, Canadian truckers have been protesting a new rule that requires them to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or face a two-week quarantine in their homes after they return across the US-Canadian border. Others have joined to rally against mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions on gatherings and other Covid-19 preventative efforts in the country.Demonstrations have popped up across Canada, including at the Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit and is the busiest international crossing in North America. Idling trucks and vehicles impeded access to the bridge for a third day Wednesday, snarling traffic on both sides of the border.""When the border crossing of this magnitude -- almost a third of all traffic between our two countries crosses here -- and when it closes down, it has an immediate and material impact on the economies of our both nations,"" Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN's Don Lemon on Tuesday night. The Canadian trucker protest is in its second week. This is how we got hereSome protesters have been loud -- so annoyingly loud that a lawsuit is demanding an end to the deafening honking unleashed by the truckers in downtown Ottawa, Canada's capital, where residents have endured the near-constant noise in their homes. Read MoreZexi Li, who lives within five blocks of protests at Parliament Hill, sued to demand an end to the beeping. Sound levels from the air and train horns are ""dangerous and cause permanent damage to the human ear"" and cause ""significant mental distress, suffering and torment,"" the lawsuit filed by the 21-year-old says. Ontario Superior Court Justice Hugh McLean on Monday issued a 10-day injunction that prevents demonstrating truckers on downtown Ottawa streets from using air or train horns. A hearing is set for next Wednesday.Mayor Jim Watson described the constant honking of large trucks as ""tantamount to psychological warfare"" and wrote in letters to federal and provincial officials earlier this week that, ""People are living in fear and are terrified.""As of Wednesday morning, Canadian-bound traffic at the Ambassador Bridge was still shut down, Michigan officials tweeted. US-bound traffic was flowing for both commercial and passenger traffic, according to US Customs and Border Protection. Access to the bridge from the Canadian side could be tricky, however. Owing in part to protests on that side, traffic was heavy and some roads were blocked. One access route in particular was still open, Windsor police Constable Talya Natyshak said.About 100 protesters were in the area of the bridge in Windsor as of 9 a.m. ET Wednesday, Natyshak said.Canadian-bound and US-bound lanes were open to passenger and some commercial traffic at an alternative, the Detroit-Windsor tunnel, which has height restrictions, according to Canadian and US border websites.An unvaccinated truck driver died from Covid-19. His mom has a message for protesting Canadian truckersAnother alternative, the Blue Water Bridge connecting Port Huron and Sarnia about a 60-mile drive northeast of Detroit, was open to traffic from both sides. While little wait was reported for US-bound traffic and Canada-bound passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles headed to Canada were enduring delays of more than four hours Wednesday morning, according to Canada's website for wait times.The truckers' vaccine rule that kicked off the protests remains. But some of the Covid-19 related restrictions that moved others to join truckers in their protests have started to go away.Provincial public health officials across Canada, who are largely responsible for imposing and lifting most health restrictions, have lifted some measures in recent weeks. As the most recent surge of Covid-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant subsided, nearly all provinces have seen a decrease in new hospital admissions -- though ICU occupancy remains stubbornly high. Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, has said in recent days that it is prudent for provinces to react and adapt health restrictions based on local circumstances. A protester walks in front of parked trucks on February 8 as demonstrators in Ottawa, Canada,  continue to protest the vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Protesters block access to Alberta-Montana crossingProtesting truckers also blocked access Tuesday and Wednesday to a border crossing connecting Coutts, Alberta, to Sweet Grass, Montana, Canadian police said.Demonstrators moved 10 farm tractors and three passenger vehicles onto Alberta's Highway 4 around 8 p.m. Tuesday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesperson Fraser Logan said.The border crossing remained inaccessible Wednesday morning, preventing movement in both directions, Logan said. CNN has reached out to the Canadian Border Services Agency for comment.There was little police could do to remove trucks from Highway 4, RCMP Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said Tuesday. Even if officers were to detain the truckers blocking the road, they wouldn't be able to clear the blockade, he said.""Moving vehicles like these requires special equipment and operators,"" Zablocki said.  DHS bulletin warns trucker convoy could disrupt Super Bowl SundayProtests started in Coutts 12 days ago with more than 250 truckers but as of Tuesday evening had dwindled to around 50, Zablocki said.Alberta Premier Jason Kenney announced Tuesday evening that the province has begun to roll back some Covid-19 restrictions. Albertans won't need to show proof of their vaccination to eat in restaurants or get into venues; some capacity limits are removed; masks mandates for schools will be removed Monday.Kenney addressed the blockade in the news conference, calling it an inconvenience that's hurting business across the province.  ""I've said consistently we welcome the freedom of people to protest lawfully and peaceful, but this is not a lawful protest,"" Kenney said. ""This and other road blockages constitute a safety hazard a serious interference in the lives of others."" Roughly 150,000 trucks pass through the Sweet Grass-Coutts border crossing each year, according to US Department of Transportation. The nearest border crossing to the east adds about two hours of travel to a trip; the nearest crossing to the west adds about an hour. Many Ottawans are at their 'breaking point' In Ottawa, the police department has requested additional resources from Mayor Watson so it can better deal with the unrest. ""We have been 100% full out on this for the last 10 days straight, and we will not rest until it's done, but we need more help,"" Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly said Monday.Sloly has been pushing all three levels of government for ""whatever they can bring to bear on the permanent, sustainable, lawful, safe resolution of this demonstration,"" he said, adding that many Ottawans are at their ""breaking point."" Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau to protesters: 'It has to stop'""This is crushing for those residents and their businesses,"" he said. ""It has to stop, and we are doing everything we can possibly do to stop it. We need more help; we're asking for that help; and we're starting to receive that help, but we need more to get this done.""In letters the mayor wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada's minister of safety and Ontario's premier and solicitor general, he asked for additional officers ""to quell the insurrection that the Ottawa Police Service is not able to contain.""Police have opened more than 60 criminal investigations linked to the protests and 23 arrests have been made. Charges include mischief, flight from police and menacing. More than 1,300 tickets have been issued for violations ranging from excessive noise and use of fireworks to driving a motor vehicle on a sidewalk.A small line of semi-trailer trucks line up along northbound I-75 in Detroit as the Ambassador Bridge entrance is blocked off for travel to Canada on February 8.'It's unclear how this ends,' mayor says Trudeau on Monday acknowledged protesters had a right to voice their concerns but said residents do not deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods.""This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians, but Canadians know the way to get through it is continuing to listen to science, continuing to lean on each other, continuing to be there for each other,"" he said after underscoring that Canadians are tired of Covid-19 health restrictions.Canadian protesters block the busiest international crossing in North America as tensions ramp up over Covid-19 rulesSpeaking to CNN on Tuesday, Dilkens, the Windsor mayor, said Canada is a Democratic society, where protesting is acceptable. ""But blocking off the busiest border crossing between our two nations is not ok. So how do we get at least a lane of traffic open in each direction to allow trucks to continue to flow to get goods to market in the US?"" Dilkens said. Dilkens added that he's not sure what protesters' ""end game"" is ""It has gathered a head of steam, yes, with folks who are feeling upset about vaccine restrictions or mandates, having to wear a mask,"" Dilkens said. ""But it's also been a gathering point and rallying cry for many who are just angry with government in general. And so it is unclear how this ends, and what would make everyone happy so that they go away and stop protesting. We're not sure.""CNN's Paradise Afshar, Raja Razek, Joe Sutton, Keith Allen, Laura James, Jason Hanna, Melissa Alonso, Caroline Kucera, Caroll Alvarado, contributed to this report."

Canadian-bound traffic was still shut down Tuesday morning, Michigan officials tweeted, while US-bound traffic was flowing with limited bridge access, Windsor Police and 511Ontario tweeted.The Canadian trucker protest is in its second week. This is how we got hereFurther threatening supply chain disruptions, protests also blocked traffic overnight Monday at the Coutts access point between Alberta and Montana, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. That crossing partially reopened Tuesday afternoon, with vehicles able to cross into Canada but large commercial vehicles heading to the US asked to use the Aden, Del Bonita and Carway crossings to avoid delays, the RCMP Alberta tweeted.The bold move at the continent's busiest international crossing signals a ratcheting up of demonstrations that have rocked Canada and galvanized thousands against its leadership. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, emerging Monday from a weeklong isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus, echoed residents and officials aggravated by the demonstrations, which began January 29 as an objection to a vaccine mandate requiring truckers entering Canada to be fully vaccinated or face testing and quarantine requirements. Read MoreMore protesters have since joined to rail against mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions on gatherings and other efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. Some have vowed not to leave until certain Covid-19 measures are rescinded, they've told CNN. ""Individuals are trying to blockade our economy, our democracy and our fellow citizens' daily lives. It has to stop,"" Trudeau said Monday at an emergency parliamentary debate in Ottawa.  Canada's capital city has endured widespread turmoil, including blaring horns on downtown streets and businesses forced to close temporarily. More than 60 criminal investigations are underway there, as claims of hate crimes, rock-throwing and property damage were reported, police said Sunday. At least 450 citations were issued over the weekend, they said.On Tuesday, the Ottawa Police Service said 23 arrests have been made since the protests began on charges that include mischief, flight from police and menacing. More than 1,300 tickets have been issued for violations ranging from excessive noise and use of fireworks to driving a motor vehicle on a sidewalk. Ontario Superior Court Justice Hugh McLean on Monday issued a 10-day injunction to prevent demonstrating truckers on downtown Ottawa streets from using air or train horns.Ottawa resident Zexi Li, 21, who lives within five blocks of Parliament Hill, filed a lawsuit calling for an end to the incessant honking. The suit said sound levels from the air and train horns are ""dangerous and cause permanent damage to the human ear"" and cause ""significant mental distress, suffering and torment."" A hearing is set for a week from Wednesday. ""We have been 100% full-out on this for the last 10 days straight, and we will not rest until it's done, but we need more help,"" Police Chief Peter Sloly said Monday, appealing to all levels of government and noting his department asked the mayor's office for a ""significant increase"" in resources. Police stand near protesters Monday after the mayor of Ottawa declared a state of emergency in the Canadian capital. A 10-day protest by truck drivers over Covid-19 restrictions has gridlocked its city center.Many in Ottawa are at their ""breaking point,"" Sloly said.""This is crushing for those residents and their businesses. It has to stop, and we are doing everything we can possibly do to stop it,"" he said.  ""We need more help.""Protests notwithstanding, nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, the Canadian government said. Demonstrators represent a ""small, fringe minority,"" Trudeau said, and his government does not expect the vaccine mandate to significantly affect supply chains.Just over 80% of Canadians in all are vaccinated, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.Bridge traffic backed up for milesPolice worked Monday to restore the orderly flow of traffic due to interruptions at the exit from the Ambassador Bridge onto Huron Church Road, Windsor Police said.""Avoid the area or find alternate route, if possible,"" police said, calling traffic flow ""temporarily interrupted.""""Our officers continue to work hard to keep the flow of traffic moving along Huron Church Rd., as well as ensuring order and public safety. ... We encourage everyone to be patient and respectful,"" Windsor Police said on Twitter.Windsor Police posted a photo online earlier in the day showing a long line of trucks appearing to be at a standstill. They also warned of travel delays and a high potential for traffic congestion, and asked ""those involved not to endanger members of the public.""Huron Church Rd. closed off bet. College & Tecumseh Rd W. for all traffic. Avoid the area. We urge those involved not to endanger members of the public, jeopardize public peace or participate in illegal events.

Access to the bridge from the US side of the border was closed, the Michigan Department of Transportation said Monday night.""The freeway traffic trying to get across the bridge is backed up on multiple roadways and for miles,"" agency spokeswoman Diane Cross told CNN.More than 40,000 commuters, tourists and truck drivers cross the Ambassador Bridge each day, according to its website.Demonstrations affected border wait times Monday at the Ambassador Bridge, Canada Border Services said.Seeking a 'permanent, sustainable, lawful' outcomeOttawa Mayor Jim Watson has declared a state of emergency in response to the protests, and most businesses downtown have closed or reduced their hours because of the unrest. Covid-19: Comparing the US and Canada""No officers are on days off, everyone has been working,"" Sloly said Monday. ""We are stretched to the limit, but we are 100% committed to using everything we have to end this demonstration. We cannot do it alone. ""That's why I have been advocating for all three levels of government to bring whatever they can bring to bear on the permanent, sustainable, lawful, safe resolution of this demonstration."" With protesters parked in trucks right outside the building, Trudeau on Monday acknowledged they had a right to voice their concerns but said residents do not deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods.""This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians, but Canadians know the way to get through it is continuing to listen to science, continuing to lean on each other, continuing to be there for each other,"" he said after underscoring that Canadians are tired of Covid-19 health restrictions. Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau to protesters: 'It has to stop'Conservative opposition leader Candice Bergen accused the Prime Minister of dividing Canadians and asked whether Trudeau regretted calling the protesters ""names,"" regarding his earlier ""small, fringe minority"" comments.""Does he regret calling people names who didn't take the vaccine? Does he regret calling people misogynistic and racists and just escalating and poking sticks at them?"" Bergen asked in parliament.Trudeau responded by saying most Canadians trust each other to do the right things when it comes to following science. ""This is the story of a country that got through this pandemic by being united, and a few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are,"" he said.

A larger skyscraper, which appears to be at least 40 stories tall, is also depicted in the plans.In a speech titled ""Let Us Further Glorify the Golden Age of Capital City Construction by Bringing about a Sea Change in the Hwasong Area,"" Kim thanked construction workers and army personnel at the ceremony, according to Sunday's edition of North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper. The state-run paper claimed that the project demonstrated the regime's commitment to creating a ""new world of a prosperous power where the people enjoy the highest dignity and the best happiness.""Kim Jong Un pictured in front of an artistic rendering of the new development. Credit: EyePress News/ShutterstockThe development forms part of a wider housing drive that has seen the government promise 50,000 new homes in Pyongyang before the end of 2025. But the pledge, announced at the Workers' Party of Korea Congress last year, comes as North Korea grapples with sanctions over its nuclear weapons program and plummeting trade with its closest ally, China. The country's economy has been in freefall since 2020, when Kim's government closed its borders due to Covid-19, though rail freight transport has resumed as of last month.In a rare admission of the country's challenges, Kim's rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly, said last month that it was working to improve livelihoods in light of  ""difficult and complicated problems,"" according to North Korean state media. North Korea also has a long-standing housing shortage, with some studies suggesting that the country only has enough homes to accommodate 70% to 80% of its households.A 3D visualization of the development shows a tall skyscraper on the left, with other towers lining a wide street.

'Beauty is freedom': The North Korean millennials wearing makeup to rebel against the stateA documentary broadcast in North Korea last month, titled ""The Great Year of Victory 2021,"" showed Kim visiting a construction site alongside images of an 80-story skyscraper and a large apartment district. Work at Hwasong began just days before the country marks what would have been the late former leader Kim Jong Il's 80th birthday. The new development is one of several high-rise projects announced in recent years in Pyongyang, where residents enjoy a significantly better quality of life than anywhere else in the country.  Related video: How North Korea creates the fantasy of prosperity through design According to data from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, there are currently 15 completed buildings standing 150 meters (492 feet) or above in the North Korean capital. Among them are four of the towers built at Ryomyong New Town, a showpiece luxury residential area opened in Pyongyang in 2017. And state media reported in January that work was almost complete on 10,000 newly built housing units in the Songsin and Songhwa districts of eastern Pyongyang.The country's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) has previously boasted about so-called ""Pyongyang Speed,"" claiming to have completed the frame of a 70-story skyscraper at Ryomyong New Town in just 74 days. But some experts have raised concerns about the quality of construction materials, as well as the level of technical know-how and the pace at which work is sometimes carried out.

That's good news for the country as a whole, but the island nation's leopards are under threat.

""We've lost a lot of leopards,"" says Watson.

(Video courtesy of Chitral Jayatilake) In 1994 she moved to Ontario, Canada, to study at McMaster University, and met her future husband, Andrew Kittle.A few years later the couple, who share a passion for wildlife, had settled in Sri Lanka. In 2000 they launched a pilot project to study leopards in Yala National Park in the island's southeast. At the time, very little was known about the elusive animals, says Watson. To protect them, it was vital to understand their lives -- and to count them. Watson and Kittle, who went on to establish the Wilderness & Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT) in 2004, currently work in four locations around Sri Lanka. They are investigating the size of the leopard population using remote cameras that take photos when they detect movement. Leopards that are caught on camera can be identified because each one has a unique pattern of spots -- and famously, their spots never change. Read: Google-backed project is collecting millions of wildlife camera-trap imagesInstalling the cameras is often grueling work, says Watson. It can involve long drives on spine-rattling, rocky tracks, clambering up hillsides, bushwhacking through jungle, and occasional encounters with elephants, bears and snakes, as well as leeches and ticks.Anjali Watson attaches a motion-detecting camera to a tree.Out in the field, the team collects leopard scat to find out which animals they are hunting -- leopards are not picky eaters and their diet includes deer, monkeys, wild boar, porcupines and hares. Watson hopes that WWCT's data will help to shape development plans that make space for leopards. If corridors between forest patches and buffer zones around protected areas are safeguarded, both humans and animals could thrive. Watson is dedicated to ensuring that these ""beautiful, fabulous creatures"" survive. "
asia,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/asia/fukushima-wildlife-intl-scli-scn/index.html,Wildlife flourishing in uninhabited areas around Fukushima ,By Amy Woodyatt," (CNN)Nearly a decade after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area. A Japanese serow explores the area. Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species -- including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.Read More""Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,"" James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said in a statement.Chernobyl control room now open to visitors -- but only wearing a hazmat suitPhotographic data was collected from 106 camera sites from three zones: Areas where humans were excluded due to the highest level of contamination; areas where humans were restricted due to an intermediate level of contamination; and areas where people were allowed to remain.Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited. In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people. Researchers captured images of more than 20 species, including macaque monkeys, in the areas surrounding the plant. Researchers also saw higher numbers of racoons, Japanese marten, a weasel-like animal, and Japanese macaque or monkeys in uninhabited or restricted zones. Species considered to be ""in conflict"" with humans, such as wild boar, were predominantly photographed in areas and zones evacuated by humans, Beasley said.Inside Slavutych, the city created by the Chernobyl explosionWhile the research monitors the radiological impact on wildlife populations as a whole, it does not give an assessment on the health of individual animals, scientists noted. The study was published Monday in the Journal of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, was produced in addition to the team's research on Chernobyl, where wildlife has also thrived in the wake of the disaster."

asia,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/shanghai-relocate-building-preservation-intl-hnk-scli/index.html,A 5-story building in Shanghai 'walks' to a new location,,"Written by Jessie Yeung, CNNSerenitie Wang, CNNShanghai residents passing through the city's eastern Huangpu district in October might have stumbled upon an unusual sight: a ""walking"" building.An 85-year-old primary school has been lifted off the ground -- in its entirety -- and relocated using new technology dubbed the ""walking machine."" In the city's latest effort to preserve historic structures, engineers attached nearly 200 mobile supports under the five-story building, according to Lan Wuji, chief technical supervisor of the project.The supports act like robotic legs. They're split into two groups which alternately rise up and down, imitating the human stride. Attached sensors help control how the building moves forward, said Lan, whose company Shanghai Evolution Shift developed the new technology in 2018.""It's like giving the building crutches so it can stand up and then walk,"" he said.A timelapse shot by the company shows the school inching laboriously along, one tiny step at a time.According to a statement from the Huangpu district government, the Lagena Primary School was constructed in 1935 by the municipal board of Shanghai's former French Concession. It was moved in order to make space for a new commercial and office complex, which will be completed by 2023. Workers had to first dig around the building to install the 198 mobile supports in the spaces underneath, Lan explained. After the pillars of the building were truncated, the robotic ""legs"" were then extended upward, lifting the building before moving forward.Over the course of 18 days, the building was rotated 21 degrees and moved 62 meters (203 feet) away to its new location. The relocation was completed on October 15, with the old school building set to become a center for heritage protection and cultural education.The project marks the first time this ""walking machine"" method has been used in Shanghai to relocate a historical building, the government statement said.Decades of destructionIn recent decades, China's rapid modernization has seen many historic buildings razed to clear land for gleaming skyscrapers and office buildings. But there has been growing concern about the architectural heritage lost as a result of demolition across the country. Some cities have launched new preservation and conservation campaigns including, on occasion, the use of advanced technologies that allow old buildings to be relocated rather than demolished.Official indifference toward historic architecture can be traced back to the rule of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong. During the disastrous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, innumerable historic buildings and monuments were destroyed as part of his war on the ""Four Olds"" (old customs, culture, habits and ideas).Can 'fast-forward' China safeguard its past? Mao's death in 1976 saw calls for architectural conservation reemerge, with China's government granting protected status to a number of structures before passing a heritage preservation law in the 1980s. In the years that followed, buildings, neighborhoods and even entire towns were given state support to maintain their historic appearances.Nonetheless, relentless urbanization has continued to pose a significant threat to architectural heritage. The sale of land is also a key source of revenue for local governments, meaning that buildings with architectural value are often sold off to property developers for whom conservation is not a priority. In the capital Beijing, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of its historic alleys and traditional courtyard homes were destroyed between 1990 and 2010, according to state-run newspaper China Daily.Should China move its historic monuments?In the early 2000s, cities including Nanjing and Beijing -- prompted by critics protesting the loss of old neighborhoods -- drew up long-term plans to preserve what was left of their historic sites, with protections introduced to safeguard buildings and restrict developers. These conservation efforts have taken different forms. In Beijing, a near-ruined temple was transformed into a restaurant and gallery, while in Nanjing, a cinema from the 1930s was restored to resemble its original form, with some additions outfitting it for modern use. In 2019, Shanghai welcomed Tank Shanghai, an arts center built in renovated oil tanks.""Relocation is not the first choice, but better than demolition,"" said Lan, the Shanghai primary school's project supervisor. ""I'd rather not touch the historical buildings at all.""He added that to relocate a monument, companies and developers have to go through strict regulations, such as getting approval from government at various levels. Building relocations he said however, are ""a viable option."" ""The central government is putting more emphasis on the protection of historical buildings. I'm happy to see that progress in recent years."" Moving monumentsShanghai has arguably been China's most progressive city when it comes to heritage preservation. The survival of a number of 1930s buildings in the famous Bund district and 19th-century ""shikumen"" (or ""stone gate"") houses in the renovated Xintiandi neighborhood have offered examples of how to give old buildings new life, despite some criticism about how the redevelopments were carried out. The city also has a track record of relocating old buildings. In 2003, the Shanghai Concert Hall, built in 1930, was moved over 66 metes (217 feet) to make way for an elevated highway. The Zhengguanghe Building -- a six-story warehouse, also from the 1930s -- was then shifted 125 feet (38 meters) as part of a local redevelopment in 2013.More recently, in 2018, the city relocated a 90-year-old building in Hongkou district, in what was then considered to be Shanghai's most complex relocation project to date, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.There are a few ways to go about moving a building: It can slide down a set of rails, or be pulled along by vehicles, for instance. But the Lagena Primary School, which weighs 7,600 tons, posed a new challenge -- it's T-shaped, whereas previously relocated structures were square or rectangular, according to Xinhua. The irregular shape meant that traditional methods of pulling or sliding may not have worked because it may not have withstood the lateral forces placed on it, said Lan. An aerial shot of the Shanghai Lagena Primary School building.  Credit: Shanghai Evolution Shift ProjectThe building also needed to be rotated and follow a curved route to its relocation instead of just moving in a straight line -- another challenge that required a new method. ""During my 23 years of working in this area, I haven't seen any other company that can move structures in a curve,"" he added.Experts and technicians met to discuss possibilities and test a number of different technologies before deciding on the ""walking machine,"" Xinhua said.

asia,https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/tech/autox-robotaxi-china-intl-hnk/index.html,Self-driving robotaxis are taking off in China,"By Michelle Toh, CNN Business","Hong Kong (CNN Business)The world has been inching toward fully autonomous cars for years. In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.On Thursday, AutoX, an Alibaba (BABA)-backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside. This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn't restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city's downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin.

""It's a dream,"" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. ""After working so hard for so many years, we've finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.""Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. ""We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,"" he said. ""The AI software is better [now.]""""From a technical point of view, the car is ready,"" Xiao said. ""It's very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.""AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called ""Professor X."" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won't change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.Race of the robotaxiWhile AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it's not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.In October, Alphabet's Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it's like to ride in a self-driving car.'I'm not drunk, it's my car:'  Tesla's 'full self-driving' gets mixed reviewsThis year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.In June, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.Recently, Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) also announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba's Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app. Michigan plans to redesign a stretch of road for self-driving carsThe startup's latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.Some of the company's lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.""The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,"" he added. ""For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.""China, home to the world's biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.""The bar is incredibly high,"" he said. ""It's extremely challenging, but we're very happy."""

Health officials caution that travel increases your chances of getting and spreading the virus. Staying home is the best way to stem transmission. Below is information on what to know if you still plan to travel, last updated on February 17.(CNN) — If you're planning to travel to Japan, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic.The basicsJapan was initially lauded for containing the virus during the first wave but has since seen several surges in cases. Following the identification of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, Japan shut its borders to all foreigners except those visiting the country on humanitarian grounds, effective November 30.Foreign residents of Japan, even if they have residency, who travel to Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia or Zimbabwe will not be allowed to re-enter the country.On January 17, the health ministry announced that it would allow 87 international students to enter Japan sometime in late January or early February.These specially selected students will be required to spend 10 days in quarantine accommodation prepared by their schools before joining the rest of the student body. What's on offerA heady mix of the cutting edge and deeply traditional, Japan remains a major draw for travelers from all over the globe. Whether participating in a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto, scouring Tokyo's Akihabara district for tech bargains or soaking in a hot onsen in the forests of Tohoku, this is a country that leaves its mark on all who visit.Who can goJapan has some of the most stringent travel restrictions in the world. Though there are reports that the government will relax its border measures in March 2022, this has not yet been officially confirmed. Currently, 3,500 people can enter Japan per day for non-tourism purposes, but it is likely that number will be raised to 5,000 in March. Consult MOFA for the latest information.What are the restrictions?Those traveling under Japan's revised business travel rules will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure, signed and stamped by the laboratory where it was taken. While they will not need to self-isolate, they will need to provide details of their movements for the following two weeks and not use public transport.Under these states and quasi-states, prefecture governments were allowed to make restrictions about things like crowd sizes and restaurant hours. With those designations lifted, it is possible for venues like bars, malls and cinemas to reopen. What's the Covid situation?As of February 17, Japan had reported 4,064,142 confirmed cases of the virus and 20,756 deaths. About 80 percent of eligible adults have gotten at least two rounds of a Covid vaccine.Japan confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant on December 22, 2021. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases confirmed that the infected patient was a Japanese man in his 30s returning from Namibia. Japan's health ministry has announced that it will allow prefectures to let younger patients who are considered lower risk to self-administer antigen tests and start isolating at home without waiting for a doctor's diagnosis.Previously, patients had to be registered as a Covid-19 patient by a doctor, who reported each new case to the government. If adopted, the new policy will allow patients to contact local public health centers themselves. This measure is intended to reduce the number of people visiting hospitals and health centers.What can visitors expect?While much of Japan remains open for business, cities are far quieter than usual and the government has the right to request the closure of businesses in areas of high transmission. Masks must be worn in public.Useful linksMinistry of Foreign AffairsJapan Tourist BoardOur latest coverageOsaka is now home to the world's first -- and so far only -- Super Nintendo World, where visitors can put on virtual reality glasses and play a real-life version of Mario Kart.Fukushima is ready for tourists again, while you can practice shirin yoku, or forest bathing, in Kyoto's Sagano Bamboo Forest.For something a little less idyllic, there's a museum dedicated to poop in Yokohama.

Both of the country's international airports reopened on the same day. ""The livelihood of around 3 million people depends on tourism in Sri Lanka,"" Ranatunga told media. ""It is our national responsibility to take into consideration the needs of our citizens that depend on this industry.""  As part of efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Sri Lanka created a ""bio bubble,"" which will give visitors a relative amount of freedom to travel within the country while still observing safety protocols.Though there is no minimum time that a visitor must spend in the country, anyone coming from abroad must stay in a government-approved hotel or resort for up to two weeks upon arrival. That means that travelers only coming for a short trip will just stay in their resort the entire time, while people who are planning longer stays will be able to move more freely within Sri Lanka once they complete their two-weeks of semi-quarantine.Related contentHow to explore Sri Lanka's southern coast in styleUnlike places like Hong Kong and Australia, where people quarantining upon arrival must stay in their hotel rooms for the entire duration, Sri Lanka's regulations are a bit laxer. Guests will have free rein on-property, so they can use facilities like pools, gyms, salons and restaurants. Travelers can also leave the hotel during quarantine to go sightseeing, provided they do so carefully. About a dozen tourism sites and attractions are open to foreign visitors, but with caveats. The five-star Anantara Peace Haven in Tangalle is on the list of approved hotels.Anantara Peace Haven TangalleFor instance, as part of the ""bio bubble,"" attractions like Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) and the Royal Botanic Gardens, both in the central city of Kandy, require visitors to come as part of an organized tour group or with an approved Sri Lankan guide. They must travel in a private vehicle and not make any unauthorized side stops. Some sites will only allow tourists during designated time slots or on certain days of the week.Currently, 55 hotels and resorts fall under the ""safe and secure level one"" guidelines. They are not allowed to accept any local guests or host any events while they're part of the bio bubble.With extra security comes extra fees. In addition to paying for flights and accommodation, travelers are responsible for the cost of Sri Lanka's government-sanctioned health insurance ($12 US) and up to three Covid tests in-country ($40 each). Everyone coming into the country must show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within 96 hours of travel and fill out an online health declaration form. Guests will be tested again at their own expense on the fifth and seventh days after arriving and people staying longer than seven days will have to take a third test the following week. Once the two weeks are up and they have a negative coronavirus test, travelers can stay at their hotel or switch to another one of the approved hotels. Airbnbs, guest houses and other forms of accommodation are off limits. Taking public transit is discouraged.All prospective travelers must apply for a visa online and download the Visit Sri Lanka app. The app will be used for contact tracing as well as storing information about test results and hotel bookings.Sigiriya Fortress is among the dozen or so Sri Lanka attractions open to foreign tourists.  ALEX OGLE/AFP/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile nearly every country can demonstrably show that its tourism revenue had taken a hit amid the coronavirus pandemic, Sri Lanka has suffered from particularly unlucky timing. A series of terrorist attacks in the capital of Colombo on Easter Sunday 2019 heavily dented the country's tourism scene, and Sri Lanka had just finished rebuilding its infrastructure when the pandemic hit.Following the initial Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020, most countries in Asia closed their borders to tourism and few have reopened since. Sri Lanka will join the Maldives as one of two destinations in the region with open borders. "

Still, citizens of the city-state have expressed an interest in being able to travel again. A much-hyped ""travel bubble"" with Hong Kong was indefinitely postponed in December when Hong Kong had a spike in virus cases.

Such offenses would be subject to up to three years imprisonment.It will also be an offense to perform conversion practices on anyone -- irrespective of age -- where the practices have caused serious harm, and offenders can be subject to up to five years imprisonment.Laws against conversion therapy have been gaining momentum around the world. Canada's parliament voted unanimously last year to ban LGBT conversion therapy.The United States does not have a federal ban on conversion therapy, but several US states, including California, Colorado, New York, Washington and Utah, prohibit the practice to some degree.Aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, conversion therapy can include talk therapy, hypnosis, electric shocks and fasting. In extreme cases, exorcism and ""corrective rape"" for lesbians, have been documented.Ending conversion therapy was one of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's campaign promises when she was elected for a second term last year."

Waseem Baloch's lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, confirmed the acquittal with CNN Tuesday but did not provide further details. A court order has not yet been made public. Waseem Baloch was arrested within days of the murder and confessed on video to killing his 25-year-old sister at her family home in the city of Multan in Pakistan's Punjab province. Despite his admission, he pleaded not guilty in court and in 2019 was sentenced to life imprisonment. Pakistan's so-called 'honor killings' typically involve the murder of a woman by a relative who believes she has brought shame upon the family. At the time of Qandeel Baloch's murder, Pakistan law allowed a murder victim's family to pardon a convicted killer. Read MoreRights activists feared this law would be used to spare Waseem Baloch. Three months after Qandeel Baloch's death, Pakistan lawmakers responded to the public outcry and passed legislation against the controversial practice -- a landmark ruling welcomed by rights activists and lawyers.

""This is the sorry state of not so sorry State...we are sorry Qandeel. Shocked and speechless,"" she said.  Sanam Maher, the author of ""A Woman Like Her: The Short Life of Qandeel Baloch,"" also expressed her anger on Instagram.""In a society that takes great pleasure in the punishment of women who break the rules, it should come as no surprise that each suspect in this case has been acquitted,"" Maher said.""After today's verdict, we may ask, who killed her? Nobody, it seems. In accepting that answer, we are all complicit in the crime of failing to protect women.""Waseem Baloch confessed to killing his sister on a video aired at a media conference.Qandeel Baloch gained both fame and notoriety in inherently conservative and patriarchal Pakistan for her bold, sassy and increasingly political social media posts. In posts not dissimilar to the millions of posts and videos shared by 20-something social media celebrities across the Internet, she pouted into the camera, discussed hairstyles and shared cooing confessions about her celebrity crushes.Qandeel referred to herself as a ""modern day feminist"" and had nearly 750,000 followers on Facebook.But in Pakistan, her antics pushed the boundaries of what is considered acceptable.In a confession video, Waseem Baloch said he was ""proud"" of killing his sister, adding that having his friends share her pictures and video clips was ""too much"" for him.""I drugged her first, then I killed her,"" he said. ""Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions. My sister never did that."" "

asia,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/asia/kabul-attack-us-marine-testimony-update-intl/index.html,Testimony from US Marines casts doubt on Pentagon's account of Kabul airport attack aftermath,"By Nick Paton Walsh, Sandi Sidhu, Julia Hollingsworth, Masoud Popalzai, Sitara Zamani, Abdul Basir Bina, Katie Polglase and Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN"," (CNN)Newly released testimony from US military survivors of the August 26 attack at Kabul airport has cast doubt on the findings of the Pentagon's investigation into the incident, which concluded that nobody was hit by gunfire in its aftermath.  The testimony also adds to some of the questions raised in this week's CNN investigation, in which Afghan survivors recalled seeing people shot in front of them. Afghan medical staff in five hospitals also reported seeing gunshot wounds in the dead and wounded, and one doctor recalled removing bullets from four patients. The Pentagon had dismissed the Afghan accounts as the result of memories jumbled by the impact of the blast, or, in the case of the medical diagnoses, the result of inadequate examinations. The investigators have nonetheless accepted they did not speak to any Afghan civilians. The testimony comes in nearly 2,000 pages from the US military investigation that were released by US Central Command under a Freedom of Information Act Request from the Washington Post on Friday night. Most of the names of interviewees are redacted, making it hard to discern who each witness is. Yet from the details that remain it is clear numerous Marines reported shooting in excess of the three bursts of warning shots the US military investigation has stated were fired by US and UK troops, and did not harm anyone. Some of the accounts are detailed. One Marine, from the Female Search Team deployed to check Afghan evacuation applicants, is explicit about when and how she opened fire. She said she decided to enter the blast area to assist colleagues after the bomb detonated, and opened fire in thick smoke without knowing what she was targeting. ""I went in and saw a lot of Marines shooting by the jersey barrier. There was a lot of smoke,"" she told investigators in an interview dated 13 October. ""I couldn't see where they were firing. They grabbed me and I started firing my weapon as well. I don't know what I was firing at."" Read MoreRead more: Horror at Kabul's gate to freedomPentagon stands by investigation of Kabul airport attack despite questions raised in CNN reportThe testimony provides an important perspective on what the US military knew as it drew conclusions that no Afghans or US personnel were shot. Their conclusions have stated that Marines did not come under fire in the aftermath, and only shot controlled bursts of fire at two suspicious military-aged males, which hurt no one.  However, in the documents, several Marines recall gunfire impacting around them in the aftermath of the blast, one seeing a round hit a window in front of him. They raise questions as to whether all the rounds fired have been accounted for by investigators, or whether they were all harmless warning shots. One Marine from 1st Regiment recalled in an interview on October 1 what he saw when he ran into the tower next to the Abbey Gate entrance to the airport where an ISIS bomber detonated his device. ""I saw Marines return fire. I heard three distinct shots hit the back windows of the tower. The third round impacted right in front of my face as I was closing the ballistic glass window.""Another said: ""I could hear sporadic rounds snapping overhead for about 5 minutes. I didn't see any tracers but saw sparks when bullets would impact things."" A group interview by investigators with junior Marines who were at the blast site, from G company 2/1 Marines, had many accounts of bullets impacting around the troops. One Marine said: ""While I was applying tournequets (sic.) I saw ricochets. Never saw a shooter."" Another quote reads: ""I saw the shots hitting around us"". Another reads: ""I saw ricochets but didn't hear gunfire."" In other excerpts, Marines suggested colleagues fired many shots back. It is unclear how many Marines were interviewed, as names of speakers are redacted. ""If there were only 2-3 shooters and the amount of our guys shooting back, they would've been done,"" said one. Another said: ""I heard that a recon guy dumped about three magazines of ammo that way."" In some interviews, other troops say they did not fire at all in the aftermath, despite the chaos and possibility they were under further attack. Much of the testimony is consistent with the conclusions of investigators.A person wounded in the ISIS bombing attack outside Kabul airport on August 26, 2021. Clothes and blood stains of Afghans who were waiting to be evacuated are seen at the site of the ISIS bombing at Kabul airport on August 26.But the testimony also raises questions as to how thoroughly the US military assessed whether patients their medics treated after the blast were shot. US investigators have stated that medics treating the injured initially mistook injuries caused by ball bearings as gunshot wounds, as they looked so similar. One medic said: ""I think there may have been GSWs [gunshot wounds] sprinkled in, but that's inconclusive and wasn't medically worth trying to figure out. They would be treated the same."" The US military investigation has insisted there were no gunshot wounds detected among any patients US medics treated on the airport, and no bullets were recovered. One US medic, identified as a ""68Z,"" the military designation for a senior officer often with medical experience, said: ""Originally, a lot of the wound (sic.) were classified as gunshot wounds, but they were actually because of shrapnel. But there were some gunshot wounds. There was a non-US patient that had a bullet inside the back of his head after small arms fire."" The medic, whose name is redacted, said in the interview they saw 70 patients and: ""I was the person writing the patients on the board and assisting everywhere."" Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for US Central Command, said in an email earlier this week to CNN that the medic was contradicted by surgeons in the operating theater who said they did not remove bullets as they worked. He said the 68Z officer was ""was not a Medical Doctor or Officer, and was not administering medical care in the Operating Room"". The ""68Z"" does however, in the interview, say they were formerly a ""combat medic"" and an ""LPN,"" a licensed practical nurse.Urban said some of the testimony highlighted to him by CNN were ""examples of statements deemed less credible ... For each of these instances you describe, we had contradictory information from several credible sources.""  Urban added: ""While there are conflicting statements, as well as inconsistent evidence, the investigation team drew its conclusions based on a preponderance of all the evidence collected, after careful analysis and synthesis."" Biden to split $7 billion in frozen funds between 9/11 victims and Afghan humanitarian aid Urban also pointed to the likely impact of the blast on troops' recollections, and noted how investigators ""assessed credibility of Service Members based on their maturity and experience in operational environments."" The documents appear to record mostly the junior Marines at the scene of the blast seeing rounds impacting around them. Urban added that medics at the airport providing care did not assess how patients were injured. ""Medical providers did not make forensic findings at HKIA and were solely focused on treatment,"" he wrote in the email.""Many individuals and Leaders unaffected by the blast indicated that claims of incoming rounds were not accurate"", Urban said. Investigators during Friday's briefing at the Pentagon said the ""confined space"" in which the warning shots were fired ""caused an echo which created the illusion of a firefight"". Urban added: ""We have multiple sources unaffected by the blast that indicate those affected by the blast who claimed to fire their weapons did not."""

The story behind those towers at the Winter Olympics big air,"By Lianne Kolirin, Nectar Gan and Tom Booth, CNN","Beijing (CNN)Winter Olympians are accustomed to performing their awe-inspiring feats against the backdrop of spectacular snow-capped mountains. But Beijing's Big Air Shougang Olympic venue is drawing attention for its much edgier, urban setting.Behind the skiers launching themselves off the 60-meter-high (196-foot) ramp are furnaces, tall chimney stacks and cooling towers on the site of a former steel mill that for decades contributed to the Chinese capital's notoriously polluted skies. The mill, founded in 1919, ceased operations more than 15 years ago, as part of efforts to clear the air in the capital ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics.That left a large stretch of prime city center land, ripe for rehabilitation and regeneration, says engineering and design company ARUP, which transformed the site into a bustling hub for tourism and art exhibitions, in 2013 it even played host to an electronic music festival.A view of the big air slope for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics at Shougang Industrial Park.

One of the cooling towers even bears the logo for the Games. Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics: Top 15 athletes to watchThe jump has captured the attention of social media users, in part for the mountains of fake snow generated to host the event, but also due to intrigue over what these towers are and why they're still standing, right behind the jump.Some Twitter users wondered if it might be a nuclear plant.""The Big Air stadium at the Olympics seems to be right next to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"" a user by the name of @jlove1982 wrote.Another, @LindsayMpls, wrote: ""Feels pretty dystopian to have some kind of nuclear facility as the backdrop for this Big Air skiing event.""The Shougang Big Air is the world's first permanent big air venue for long-term usage. It sits on the bank of the Qunming Lake, on the west side of the cooling towers at 88 meters (288 feet) above sea level, according to architecture firm TeamMinus, which designed the jump.TeamMinus outlined the inspiration behind its design on its website, citing the influence of Chinese flying apsaras, celestial beings which appear in both Buddhist and Hindu cultures.

New Zealand's Finn Bilous competes during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games at the Big Air Shougang.The Beijing government calls the site a ""Green and Eco Demonstration Area,"" according to ARUP, that could be scaled up in other parts of the country. While the regeneration project is a good example of how to repurpose aging infrastructure, the mill's closure was not necessarily a ""green"" decision, as operations -- and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with steelmaking -- were in actual fact moved to another part of the country.Panda-monium: From medal podiums to spectator stands, Winter Olympics mascot Bing Dwen Dwen is everywhereIn 2005, the entire production plant, which is owned and operated by state-owned steel company the Shougang Group, relocated to Caofeidian, in the adjoining Hebei Province, according to ARUP. The decision to move the plant was part of the Beijing government's economic restructuring and pollution control initiatives. China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases fueling the climate crisis, producing more than a quarter of the world's annual emissions.The Big Air is not the first element of the Beijing games to raise questions about the games' environmental credentials. The artificial snow being generated for the Games is made using large quantities of water and electricity.A recent CNN report also showed how the Yanqing venue was built in the former core area of the Songshan National Nature Reserve, a park founded in 1985 to protect its dense forests, alpine meadows and rich biodiversity.JUST WATCHEDWhy Beijing's pledge for green Olympics may be hypocritical ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy Beijing's pledge for green Olympics may be hypocritical  05:27The Beijing Organizing Committee did not respond to CNN's request for comment over whether it was aware the ski center was built inside the former core area of the nature reserve.

January was a record month of such tests, with at least seven launches, including a new type of ""hypersonic missile"" able to maneuver at high speed.Also among the tests was the first firing since 2017 of a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile, capable of striking US territories in the Pacific Ocean.Analysis: Kim Jong Un wants the world to know he still mattersA statement from North Korea's Foreign Ministry said a series of tests since New Year represented ""remarkable achievements"" that strengthened North Korea's ""war deterrence.""It also cited the Hwasong-15, the longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ever launched by North Korea, which hasn't been fired since its first test in 2017, and is believed to have the range to deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the US.Read More""In today's world where many countries waste time dealing with the United States with submission and blind obedience, there's only our country on this planet that can shake the world by firing a missile with the US mainland in its range,"" it said.""There are more than 200 countries in the world, but only a few have hydrogen bombs, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles,"" it said.Asked to comment, the US State Department repeated past statements that it harbored no hostile intent towards North Korea and urging a return to dialog, calls Pyongyang has persistently ignored.JUST WATCHEDAuthor on what Kim Jong Un's series of missile tests may mean ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAuthor on what Kim Jong Un's series of missile tests may mean  02:31A State Department spokesperson also called North Korea a threat to international peace and security and global nonproliferation efforts.""The United States has a vital interest in deterring (North Korea), defending against its provocations or uses of force, limiting the reach of its most dangerous weapons programs, and above all keeping the American people, our deployed forces, and our allies safe,"" the spokesperson said.Jenny Town, director of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea program, said the fact that North Korea's statement came from its Foreign Ministry probably made the statement less threatening than if might appear. ""The formulation is very passive. Not that they will do it, but that they can,"" she said.North Korea celebrated the anniversary of the founding of its army on Tuesday, a holiday that has occasionally featured major military parades with missiles and other weapons in previous years.North Korea tests a missile on January 27 in photo released by state media.There were no reports of a parade this year, however, and state media said the day was marked by senior military leaders visiting the mausoleum of the country's former rulers, among other events.US and South Korean officials have said they fear the launch of the Hwasong-12 on January 30 could be a step toward fully resuming tests of North Korea's ICBMs or nuclear weapons. North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test or fired an ICBM since 2017.The United States called on North Korea on Monday to defund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and prioritize the needs of its own people.A Washington think tank said on Monday it has identified a military base close to North Korea's border with China that is likely intended for stationing ICBMs.Talks to persuade Pyongyang to give up or limit its arsenal in return for sanctions relief have been stalled since 2019."

In one close-up view the plane hits the deck, bursts into flames and then spins in front of the camera full frame. The second angle captures the fiery wreck as it careens along the deck then slides off into the water.As the $100 million fighter makes its approach to the vessel, crew can be heard yelling ""Wave off, wave off,"" the term used for a plane to abort a landing attempt, accelerate and fly around to try again. But the warning to the pilot comes too late to avoid the crash.""That's really, really scary,"" said Peter Layton, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer now at the Griffith Asia Institute.Read MoreLayton noted that the F-35 seemed to have control problems on its approach to the carrier.Images emerge of one of the US Navy's newest stealth fighters crashing into the sea""As the aircraft is coming down the flaps are working overtime backwards and forwards. It looks like the pilot has lost control and is suffering oscillations,"" he said.He said the crash suggested to him the jet was not using an automatic landing system, digital controls which help limit the number of times the pilot must make corrections to get the plane safely on the deck. ""It's a really clever piece of software that links up the flight controls [the flaps] and the throttles and also gives the pilot some display so the pilot can monitor the system and fine tweak,"" Layton said. ""This is a reasonably new system that came out of the F-35 program.""The deployment on the Vinson was the first operational one for the F-35C, which only entered service in 2019. The US Air Force version of the stealth fighter, the F-35A and the Marine Corps version, the F-35B, were put into service earlier.The US Navy confirmed the authenticity of the video to CNN, but it has not yet released a cause of the crash.""We are aware that there has been an unauthorized release of video footage from flight deck cameras onboard USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) of the F-35C Lightning II crash that occurred Jan. 24, in the South China Sea. There is an ongoing investigation into both the crash and the unauthorized release of the shipboard video footage,"" Cmdr. Zach Harrell, spokesperson for Commander, Naval Air Forces, said in an email.The back-to-back images seen on the screen suggest it is a recording of the incident that was being replayed on the carrier when the recording was made.""The US Navy does videotape from several angles every landing so that they can go back and critique every pilot's landing,"" Layton said. An image from the first unauthorized video leaked from the USS Carl Vinson shows the F-35C shortly before it crashed on the deck.This video is the second unauthorized leak of the collision. Less than a week after the crash, video emerged of the plane on approach as did a still image of it floating momentarily on the surface of the sea.Seven people were injured in the accident including the pilot, who ejected from the plane, and six others aboard the carrier.The end of the video shows the crew responding to the incident within seconds, spraying down the deck of the carrier with foam to prevent further damage.Shortly after the crash, Navy officials described the damage to the Carl Vinson as superficial and said it quickly resumed normal operations.They also said efforts had begun to raise the wreckage of the stealth jet from the bottom of the sea.Analysts said raising the aircraft would likely be a complex operation, and one that would be monitored by China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea as its territory.The F-35C contains some of the Navy's most advanced technology, and the analysts said Washington would want to keep it out of Beijing's hands.However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was aware that a US Navy stealth fighter had crashed in the South China Sea, but ""had no interests in their plane.""""We advise [the US] to contribute more to regional peace and stability, rather than flexing force at every turn in [the South China Sea],"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.Though the Navy has not revealed where in the South China Sea the crash occurred, Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile (3.3 million square kilometer) waterway and has bolstered its claims by building up and militarizing reefs and islands there.Chinese naval and coast guard vessels maintain a constant presence in South China Sea waters."

""We are coming ... to the hour of truth,"" Le Drian said of ongoing negotiations in Vienna to salvage the landmark deal -- which former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, and Tehran began to withdraw from a year later.""It's not a matter of weeks, it's a matter of days,"" he said. Later on Wednesday, Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani struck an unusually optimistic note, saying that parties to the deal were ""closer than ever to an agreement.""  But Kani warned that negotiations could still fall through.Read More""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,"" he said in a tweet. ""Our negotiating partners need to be realistic, avoid intransigence and heed lessons of past 4yrs."" ""Time for their serious decisions,"" Kani added. Iran and the United States are engaged in a final round of indirect talks -- mediated by China, Russia and European parties to the agreement -- over a return to the 2015 nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).Why the US may find itself forced back into the Middle East  Analysts believe that failure to reach an agreement could lead violence in the crisis-ridden region to spiral out of control, with Iran fast approaching the nuclear threshold that would enable it to develop a nuclear weapon. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated in recent weeks, with Iran-backed Houthi militants launching unprecedented missile and drone attacks on the United Arab Emirates, considered a haven of security in the volatile region. Saudi-led coalition forces fighting the militant group retaliated with the deadliest offensive on Houthi-held parts of northern Yemen in years, killing scores of people and knocking out the country's internet. In his comments Wednesday, Le Drian warned that a breakdown in the Vienna talks would trigger a ""serious crisis."" ""Either [the Iranians] trigger a serious crisis in the days to come -- we could do without that -- or else they accept the agreement which respects the interests of all parties and particularly the interests of Iran,"" he said.  Le Drian said the two and half months of negotiations in Vienna was ""exhausting diplomatic work."" Iran returned to indirect negotiations with the US shortly after President Joe Biden -- who promised to return to the deal as a presidential nominee -- took office. Iran had rejected repeated overtures by the Trump administration to return to the negotiations after the former president withdrew from the deal. "
meast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/middleeast/mideast-summary-02-16-2022-intl/index.html,Why the US may find itself forced back into the Middle East  ,"By Abbas Al Lawati, Nadeen Ebrahim and Eoin McSweeney, CNN","Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN)Perceived disengagement by the United States in the Middle East has led to a strategic shift in regional priorities of late. Alarms about the withering of America's security umbrella perhaps rang loudest in Arab capitals after a 2019 attack on the heart of the Saudi economy prompted a reaction from Washington that was whimpering at best. The thinking was that if Donald Trump, arguably the US President  closest to Gulf states to date, couldn't help them, then no American administration would. The US was seen as abandoning the Middle East. Blamed on Iran, the brazen predawn attack on state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco's facilities knocked off half of Saudi crude output, sending oil prices climbing 19.5%, the most on record. Historically, an unwritten agreement between America and its oil producing Arab allies stipulated that the US would provide protection in return for a steady supply of crude to the global economy from a region that is home to more than two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves. The US has often leaned on the Gulf states to adjust output if the price of a barrel doesn't suit its economic interests, and Arab states have often obliged. Read MoreBut Arab concern about the unraveling of this arrangement has led to stubbornness when it comes to Arab oil policy and, perhaps more importantly, it has prompted some countries to address the very sources of threats to their security. A drone attack in Abu Dhabi could mark a dangerous turning point for the Middle East. Here's what to knowThe United Arab Emirates, which had been militarily active in several regional hotspots, last summer opted to steer its foreign policy towards ""good neighborliness"" and economic interests. It began talks with regional foes such as Iran, reconciled with Turkey, reached out to regional pariah Syria, and signed a peace agreement with Israel. The message was that the foreign policy would work to future-proof its economy as well as its security. But a shock came in January, when it became the target of fatal attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebel group two years after it began withdrawing its military forces from that country. The Iran-backed Houthis said the strikes were in response to continued Emirati interference in Yemen's affairs. The United States, which has been trying to reach a new nuclear agreement with the Houthis' patrons in Tehran, found itself thrust back into the region's spotlight. President Joe Biden, who had removed the Houthis from the US terror list less than a month into taking office in 2021, said he would reconsider the move. The UAE, one of America's closest allies in the region, pushed for more action, including military support. And the US has so far obliged. This month, it sent Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, head of the US Central Command, to the UAE to reinforce the country's defenses by helping it target drones before they are launched. It is also deploying a destroyer with guided missile defense capabilities to patrol the UAE's waters, and a squadron of F-22 fighter jets arrived in Abu Dhabi this week.  With its immediate focus on Russia's troop buildup on Ukrain's borders, , as well as its medium-to-long term eye on China's growing power, the United States' military interests are shifting away from the Middle East. A conclusion of the Iran deal is likely to dampen its threat perception and the very reason for its strong presence in the region, leading to a further disengagement. But, wary of leaving a security vacuum for its adversaries to fill, the message America appears to be sending Gulf states is that while it may be leaving, it will be back as the need arises. Other top Middle East news Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett meets with the King of Bahrain in Manama on Tuesday.Israeli prime minister offers 'goodwill and cooperation' on first Bahrain visit Naftali Bennett met Bahrain's king as well as Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, who said he is looking forward to ""a broader Middle East, free of conflicts, based on principles of mutual respect, understanding, and shared responsibility towards security."" Background: This is the first visit to Bahrain by an Israeli prime minister and comes a year and a half after the two countries agreed to normalize relations. Bennett's trip was his second to a Gulf state, after he visited the United Arab Emirates in December. Why it matters: This is the latest sign of the strengthening ties between some Gulf states and Israel. Shared regional security concerns, in particular fears over Iran, played a key part in underpinning normalization. Among Bennett's first appointments Tuesday was a meeting with US military officials at the Bahrain headquarters of the US Fifth Fleet.  Iranian president to travel to Qatar for gas forum  Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi will travel to Qatar on Thursday to attend the Gas Exporting Countries Forum in Doha, Iran state-run outlet IRNA said on Monday. This comes as the two gas-producing countries look to ""boost cooperation and convergence in energy policies.""  Background: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar in mid-2017 after accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Qatar has repeatedly denied. Tehran and Doha maintained close ties throughout the three-year boycott. Why it matters: Raisi's trip to Qatar is his first to a Gulf-Arab state since he took office and it comes amid the backdrop of multiple attacks by the Iranian-backed Yemen's Houthis on the United Arab Emirates over the last month.  Swedish multinational Ericsson admits it may have inadvertently funded ISIS Shares in Ericsson plummeted on Wednesday after the telecommunications company released the results of an internal investigation which found that the firm could have made payments to ISIS, Reuters reported.    Background: Ericsson started doing business in Iraq after the United Nations lifted an embargo on the country in 2010. The company discovered suspect payments made to circumvent Iraqi customs laws, which were paid in areas that were controlled by ISIS at the time.  Why it matters: Previous corruption allegations in countries such as China and Vietnam cost Ericsson more than $1 billion in 2019. Around the region A conference in Egypt on the African continent's shared heritage caused an outcry and a flurry of racist comments in the North African country last week. Titled 'One Africa: Returning to the Source,' the event was scheduled to take place in Aswan, Egypt on February 25 and 26, coinciding with US commemorations of Black History Month.  The event brochure said it aimed to show that ""all African cultures and peoples are linked together either through ethnicity, language, arts, or culture."" Among the hosts was Washington, DC-based IKG Cultural Resource Center, an organization that focuses on what they call the ""re-discovery of ancient African history and culture."" But in early February, English hashtags such as #StopAfrocentricConference and similar Arabic ones began trending on social media. Some called on Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism to shut down the seminar. The opposition was primarily to the perceived linking of ancient Egyptians to Black people. The debate even found its way to state-backed television, where prominent talk show host Nashaat Eldeehy said the organizers were ""racist"" and had a ""bias toward dark skin."" The backlash on social media turned ugly, with hundreds of commenters hurling racist insults at cultural historian Anthony T. Browder of IKG, one of the conference's main presenters. Soon after, the event was declared canceled on Browder's Facebook page and his page subsequently became unavailable. The cancellation was due to administrative reasons and its ""possible negative impact,"" he told CNN. As the debate raged, others on social media decried the harsh language used as ""racist"" and ""hateful."" New York-based Akhet Tours, one of the conference's organizers, didn't respond to requests for comment. One of the most intensely studied peoples of antiquity, ancient Egyptians have long been the subject of interest for researchers trying to identify their racial origin, culture and way of life.  DNA discovery reveals genetic history of ancient EgyptiansIn 2017, scientists in Germany were able to extract and decode mummies' genome data. In what was a wholly new frontier for Egyptologists, researchers found a strong connection with groups of ancient non-African populations based east of the Mediterranean. The study only sampled Middle Egypt, however, hypothesizing that race origins could differ in Northern and Southern Egypt. ""There is no relation between Blacks and the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization at all,"" said Zahi Hawass, a prominent Egyptologist and former Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, in a phone interview from Cairo. Bemoaning what he saw as ""a completely incorrect"" linking of Blacks to Egyptian civilization by the event organizers, he said the matter should nevertheless be debated by scientists, not lay people on social media. Given the size of the ancient Egyptian civilization, crossover between ethnicities must have taken place, said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo. ""Egypt, from quite early on, was a mixed culture because it is at the crossroads of two continents,"" she said. Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that the ministry was unaware of the conference and the events that followed.  Egypt has said of late that that it's taking steps to support and encourage cultural and economic cooperation across the African continent, emphasizing shared interest and calling for deeper regional integration. Black Arabs of sub-Saharan African origin in the Middle East and North Africa suffer social marginalization and unequal job prospects, and sometimes experience derogatory portrayals in the media, including in Egypt. What to watchTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited the United Arab Emirates on Monday in his first trip to the country in almost a decade. The two nations have found themselves on opposing sides of the ideological spectrum over the last decade, but are now ready to reconcile their differences.

A thaw in Turkish-Egyptian relations is also on the horizon and Turkish-Israeli reconciliation is in the works.   But perhaps the most stunning rapprochement has been between the UAE and Turkey -- few saw that one coming. The two were pitted against each other in almost every regional conflict for the better part of the past decade and found themselves on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum.  In the latest sign of reconciliation, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Abu Dhabi on Monday to meet with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the UAE's de facto ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (known as MBZ) and sign new agreements. It was Erdogan's first official visit to the UAE since 2013.""The reconciliation I saw [as] least likely... [with] the most problems [and] divergent interests, was that of the UAE and Turkey,"" Turkish foreign policy expert Yusuf Erim told CNN.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (L) is welcomed by Emirati officials after arriving at Abu Dhabi's international airport Monday. Read MoreThe rift emerged after Turkey publicly supported the Arab Spring protests that unseated some Arab governments and threatened others in 2011. Erdogan was one of the staunchest backers of Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated groups that played a significant role in some of those protests. That was a red line for Arab monarchies, including the UAE, which viewed those movements as an existential threat.   For Turkey, the turning point with the UAE came in 2016, after Erdogan survived an attempted coup that Turkish officials accused the UAE of backing. The following year, when Qatar's neighbors, including the UAE, boycotted the country for its alleged ties to Islamists, Turkey lent its support, further aggravating Abu Dhabi. The regional powers faced off in a dangerous rivalry driven by their expansionist foreign policy that stretched from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf and East Africa. But nowhere did it unfold as perilously as in Libya, where they engaged in a devastating proxy war from 2019.    Signs of a détente finally began to appear last summer, first with a surprise visit to Ankara by the UAE's national security adviser, then with a call between Erdogan and MBZ.  The call marked  ""a new phase ... in which the UAE seeks to build bridges ... to ensure future decades of regional stability"" said Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president. Local media has referred to the relationship as a ""strategic partnership."" Then, in November, Sheikh Mohammed arrived in Ankara for his first visit in a decade, welcomed with fanfare and a flag-waving cavalry. It had become clear by then that the status quo was unsustainable, especially at a time of perceived American disengagement from the Middle East, which risks leaving many of America's allies with no option but to fend for themselves. There was a clear shared desire to recalibrate both their foreign policies in a way that would benefit their respective economies. The two were perfectly positioned to shift to a more conciliatory approach. Turkey's inflation soars to two-decade high of almost 49%Faced with a coronavirus-related downturn, increased economic competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia and the growing cost of military engagements in the region, the UAE declared last summer that it was adopting a foreign policy U-turn. While it said that its external relations would now be determined by economic interests, the departure of President Donlad Trump and a desire to play a greater diplomatic role in the region was also a factor  in the policy shift. At the same time, Turkey's economy was tanking. Annual inflation reached near 50% and by the end of last year, with its currency losing half its value against the dollar. Ankara could no longer afford to alienate rich Gulf states. Erdogan's rise to power in 2002 has been be attributed to the economy -- he doesn't want it to now become the cause of his downfall. The president has promised to turn the economy around, knowing that failure to do so would have him pay dearly at the polls next year. He's banking on the UAE and other Gulf Arab states to inject billions into Turkey.  ""The economy is very, very important for the Turkish president,"" Erim said. ""A weaker economy before 2023 elections is definitely something he doesn't want, and the Emiratis have the money to be able to provide a booster shot for the Turkish economy.""   The money has already started flowing: the UAE has announced a $10 billion Turkey investment fund and a nearly $5 billion currency swap to boost its foreign exchange reserves. Better relations will also mean a return of Gulf Arab tourists next summer, bringing in much-needed  hard currency.   The economy may be a key driver for Erdogan. But this burgeoning relationship is part of the wider jigsaw of realignment being witnessed in an ever-changing Middle East. Other top Middle East news Iranian oil exports increase as talks in Vienna resume Increased shipments to China have nudged Iran's oil exports past 1 million barrels per day for the first time in almost three years.  Background: Sanctions aimed at cutting Tehran's oil flow were imposed after former United States President Donald Trump exited the 2015 nuclear agreement, but China has provided an outlet through intermediaries. Iran said on Monday that nuclear talks in Vienna have not reached a dead end. Why it matters: Beijing has been consistent in saying the US should lift sanctions on Iran. Oil sales could start to flow again if indirect nuclear talks in Vienna are successful, which could also help lower oil prices, currently standing at $94 -- a seven-year high.  Saudi-led coalition attacks Houthi ministry of communications  The coalition attacked the ministry in Yemen's capital Sanaa on Monday, saying it was used to ""to support hostilities.""   Background: The raid destroyed a Houthi communications system used to operate front communications stations that controls drones, according to the coalition. Why it matters: the raid comes as Iran-backed Houthis step up attacks against coalition forces, particularly the UAE, with drones and missiles.  Iraqi court bars Zebari from running for presidency Iraq's Supreme Federal Court ruled that former Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari is not eligible to run for the presidency amid corruption allegations. Background: The court said a decision by parliament to accept his presidential bid was incorrect and it also barred him from running for the post in the future. Zebari called the court's decision ""an injustice."" Why it matters: The court decision is a blow to populist Shiite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who was the biggest winner in parliamentary elections in October. Parliament had been due to vote on a new head of state last Monday but canceled the vote because it lacked quorum. What we're watching Libyan presidential elections planned for December were postponed after political infighting and administrative delays.

Around the region  Dubai will start charging for plastic bags this summer in preparation for a total ban, Mohammed Abdelbary reports. Twenty-five fils ($0.07) doesn't buy much in the United Arab Emirates; a bag of chips, a stick of gum, or maybe a lollipop if the flavor isn't popular. Starting July 1, however, kids going on a snack run in Dubai will have to account for the price of the plastic bags they carry those snacks in: 25 fils per bag.  The charge will be applied to retail, clothing, restaurants and pharmacies, as well as on delivery and e-commerce orders, the emirate said. The change is a precursor to a complete ban of single-use plastics in two years.  Dubai has also announced plans to cut carbon emissions by 30% by the end of 2030. This is part of the UAE's broader strategy of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Dubai is the first emirate to set a charge on single-use plastic bags.  Over the years, the UAE's deserts and shores have borne the costs of plastic. Single-use plastics cause 50% of camel deaths in the UAE, and 86% of turtle deaths along its shores, according to the government. While 2022 seems to be a big year for awareness around climate and the environment in UAE, 2023 is set to be even bigger as the country will host the COP28 international climate conference in 2023. "
meast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/middleeast/mideast-summary-02-10-2022-intl/index.html,Iraq faces deadlock after 'West-friendly' candidate suspended ,"By Nadeen Ebrahim and Eoin McSweeney, CNN","Abu Dhabi (CNN)He's arguably Iraq's best-known face abroad. Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurd, was the country's longest-serving foreign minister, often hobnobbing with Western diplomats and journalists, but also cultivating strong ties with neighboring Arab states to make his country's case.   But a bid to crown his political career with a run for the presidency faced a major hurdle last week when Iraq's federal court suspended his candidacy due to past corruption charges, causing an election delay that risks exacerbating existing factional divisions.  The presidential election was indefinitely postponed on Monday, stalling the already delayed formation of a new government. The results of October's parliamentary vote, in which pro-Iran factions were dealt a significant loss, were only confirmed in December due to political bickering over the results. A new president would be tasked with asking the winning bloc to form a government.  The suspension was a blow to the ambitions of Zebari's key backer Moqtada al-Sadr, the populist Shiite Muslim cleric who has emerged as a kingmaker and is bent on pushing through a government that excludes his pro-Iran Shiite rivals. Cleric Sadr wins Iraq vote, former PM Maliki close behind, officials saySixty-eight-year-old Zebari was seen as a friend of the west and was known as a successful negotiator. But his political career took a turn in 2016 when, as finance minister, he was accused of corruption and mishandling of public funds. Zebari denied the allegations.    Read MoreAccording to the post-Saddam system of governance in Iraq, the Kurdish minority assumes the presidency, while Shiites run the premiership and the Sunnis take the position of parliament speaker.  Since 2005, the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP)'s rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) has occupied the ceremonial position based on an understanding that the PUK would take Iraq's presidency while the KDP would rule the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan. Zebari was running against PUK's incumbent President Barham Saleh. But the KDP's clout in the Baghdad parliament has grown of late, emboldening the party and winning it new allies like Sadr. The revival of graft allegations has however rattled Zebari's Shiite and Sunni backers, dampening his prospects for the presidency. Sadr, who emerged as the biggest winner the October election after having campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, had to withdraw his support. It's unclear if the KDP will field another candidate that's acceptable to Sadr or stand by Zebari. Sadr reiterated his call for a government of national majority on Tuesday, after meeting Esmail Qaani, head of Iran 's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. ""Neither eastern nor western, a government of national majority,"" he said on Twitter. The slogan was reminiscent of the 1979 Iranian revolution motto ""Neither Eastern nor Western - Islamic Republican."" Iran celebrates the 43rd anniversary of its Islamic revolution this month. If Sadr gets his way and the bloc he leads elects a president of its liking, Iraq could have a government that has quite a different approach to Iran. But the idea of an Iraqi government devoid of Iran's Shiite allies won't sit well in Tehran, and those prospects risk a backlash from pro-Iran groups, many of whom are heavily armed.   Other top Middle East news Iranian man beheads teenage wife, shocking the country A video showing a smiling man walking in Iran with his teenage wife's severed head in his hand has shocked the country. His mother was quoted as saying her son had threatened to kill his wife previously and was responsible for the murder. Background: The girl had reportedly fled to Turkey four months before being persuaded to return to Iran by her father. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency referred to the killing as an ""honor"" murder.  Why it matters: The girl was reportedly 12 years old at the time of her marriage. The issue has again raised concern over the country's laws around murder and gender-based violence. Biden, Saudi king discuss energy supplies amid rising prices US President Joe Biden and King Salman of Saudi Arabia discussed energy supplies in the face of soaring fuel prices and developments in the Middle East, including Iran and Yemen, in a call on Wednesday. Background: Last week, oil producing states agreed to stick to moderate rises in its production as they struggle to meet existing targets amid calls for more crude from top consumers to cap surging prices. Why it matters: High oil prices are a risk to the Biden administration ahead of November's mid-term congressional elections in which his fellow Democrats will defend slim majorities in the Senate and US House of Representatives. Dubai plans to attract 50 multinational companies within three years  The plan is part of a three-year strategy adopted by the Dubai International Chamber to boost the emirate's status as a global trade hub. Background: Dubai is the Middle East's business hub and is already home to the regional headquarters of several multinational firms.  The government said it will also support 100 Dubai-based companies with international expansion. Why it matters: Dubai is facing increased competition from Saudi Arabia in attracting international business. The kingdom has given foreign firms until the end of 2023 to set up headquarters or risk losing out on government contracts.What we're watching The US has said that the issue of American Iranians held in the Islamic Republic is separate from its nuclear talks with Tehran, but it has also said that it is unlikely to reach a deal without their release.

Around the region Lebanese culture minister Wissam el-Mortada (second from left) attends a ceremony at Nabu Museum on February 6 to hand 337 swiped artifacts back to Iraq.Lebanon returns hundreds of stolen artifacts to Iraq, some dating back to the world's oldest civilization ""It belongs in a museum,"" is a famous quote by the swashbuckling fictional archaeology professor Indiana Jones, said in relation to artifacts being sold at high prices.  Lebanon has learned it's also important to ensure they haven't been stolen before they reach a museum.  The Levantine state is giving back to Iraq 337 swiped antiquities, some thousands of years old, many of which were looted during decades of conflict and war.  The clay figurines were housed in Nabu Museum in northern Lebanon and date back to different eras of the Mesopotamian civilization, the Iraqi foreign ministry said. The region in southwestern Asia is where the world's earliest civilization is believed to have developed.  While it's difficult to tell how many pieces are missing, Iraq hopes to recover more artifacts from several European countries.  Opened in 2018, Nabu is a private museum that has been the subject of controversy in the past, when suspicions arose that some of its collection was dug up illegally in Syria and Iraq. It returned five Roman artifacts to Syria from the ancient city of Palmyra in January.  Named after the Mesopotamian god of literacy, it houses a collection of tablets dating from 2330 to 540 BC. Time Capsule The Iranian Islamic Republic Army demonstrates in solidarity with people in the street during the Iranian revolution. They are carrying posters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious and political leader.   Iran commemorates the anniversary of its Islamic Revolution on February 11. The country's former ruler, Shah Reza Pahlavi, was toppled on that date in 1979, his regime soon to be replaced with the Islamic Republic that stands today. The Shah had the support of the US but not of his people, disgruntled by the country's economic woes, political repression, and the government's failure to deliver meaningful reform. Opposition parties threw their support behind Shiite cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled critic of the Shah, believing he was their best bet to remove the monarch. Anti-regime protests erupted in January 1978 and continued for months, with hundreds of protesters dying at the hands of government forces. On February 1, 1979, Khomeini returned to Iran, welcomed by a million-plus crowd expressing their support for him, and by February 11, the Shah's regime was officially over.

Israel said the men were responsible for at least five shooting attacks on Israeli army positions in the West Bank over recent months and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the operation showed there was ""no immunity for terrorists.""But the Palestinian Authority Foreign Ministry described the men's deaths as an assassination.

Here's what to look out for ,"By Abbas Al Lawati and Eoin McSweeney, CNN"," (CNN)Iran and the United States return to Vienna on Tuesday for another round of talks aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear agreement abandoned by the Trump administration. There have been enough indications of progress from both sides to suggest that negotiations have entered a critical phase, but a number of issues remain unresolved.  Those include the scope of sanctions relief for Iran, sequencing of events, verification mechanisms, Iran's compliance process,  Tehran's demand for guarantees the US will stick to the deal, says Sanam Vakil, senior research fellow at London's Chatham House think tank.  The latest sign of progress came on Friday when the US restored sanctions waivers. The waivers, rescinded under former President Donald Trump, had allowed Russian, Chinese and European companies to carry out non-proliferation work to make it harder for Iranian nuclear sites to be used for weapons development. The State Department hopes the waiver restoration will help the talks in Vienna. Here are some issues to watch out for that may give an indication of how the talks will progress: Read More""Maximum pressure"" sanctions The term refers to sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that go beyond those imposed by the 2015 nuclear agreement, aimed at putting pressure on the Islamic Republic to renegotiate the pact after Trump abandoned it in 2018. Iran has said that it won't accept a new deal that doesn't remove Trump's sanctions.  Some of those sanctions, which were imposed over human rights and terrorism issues, may be harder to justify lifting, say Vakil and Michael Horowitz, head of intelligence at Le Beck International, a risk management consultancy in Bahrain. It may be in the US' interest to keep those sanctions as continued leverage on Tehran, according to Horowitz. Face-to-face talks Despite Washington's repeated calls for face-to-face talks, Iran has refused to sit at the table with American diplomats, opting instead to negotiate via intermediaries until the US offers a ""good agreement."" But late last month, it indicated for the first time that it would be open to direct negotiations. If the two sides find themselves at the same table in future talks, consider it a significant development, but Horowitz says it may be too early for such a move given the domestic backlash in Iran at the suggestion last month.  Fate of dual nationals held in Iran Four Iranian-Americans are imprisoned in the Islamic Republic, an issue the US says is being used by Tehran to strengthen its hand in negotiations. America had previously said that talks on the prisoners were separate from the nuclear negotiations, but US Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley recently indicated that a new nuclear deal was unlikely to be reached without Iran releasing those prisoners. Guarantees of adherence to the pact Iran has insisted that it won't return to a deal that can be abandoned once again, and has demanded guarantees that it won't pull out in the future. Diplomats have rubbished the demand as unrealistic. ""I don't see how the US would commit to not walking back on the deal,"" says Horowitz. ""But there are, I think, some creative ways that the US and Europe, can [use to] reassure Iran."" For instance, the Europeans could work to mitigate the impact of a future US withdrawal, he says. ""The US can curate a portfolio of transactional assurances that can help Iran sell the deal back home as being a sustainable and viable one,"" says Vakil. Other top Middle East news Iraq cancels vote for new president after court postpones frontrunner's nomination  Most of Iraq's parliament boycotted a session Monday to elect a new head of state, indefinitely postponing the vote. The boycott came after the Federal Court suspended the nomination of Hoshyar Zebari, a frontrunner for the presidency.  Background: The court's decision cited an unresolved case in relation to old corruption charges, which means Zebari doesn't meet the ""good reputation"" requirement to be head of state. Why it matters: The decision was a blow to populist Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who was the biggest winner in an October election. He had vowed to push through a government that would exclude Iranian allies. Sadr had supported Zebari's bid. Once elected, the president will call on the largest parliamentary alliance to form a government.Tunisia's power struggle escalates as president moves to sack judicial council Police closed the building housing the Supreme Judicial Council in Tunisia a day after the president moved to dissolve the country's top legal body. The council has rejected the president's move, saying it will continue to carry out its duties.  Background: President Kais Saied has often expressed his disapproval over judicial delays on rulings in cases of corruption and terrorism. In July, he ousted the government and froze parliament's activities before appointing a new prime minister. Why it matters: The president's interventions have been seen as undermining the democratic gains of Tunisia's 2011 revolution that ended autocratic rule and triggered the Arab Spring.

Why it matters: In recent years China has built good relations with Middle East powerhouses such as Saudi Arabia, even helping manufacture ballistic missiles for the kingdom.  If the prince had attended the ceremony, it would have signaled deepening ties between the two countries.

Around the region A perceived plan to change the Islamic-inscribed flag of Saudi Arabia has caused a storm on social media, Celine Alkhaldi reports. The kingdom's Shura Council, an advisory body appointed by the king, unanimously approved last week a draft amendment to a 50-year-old policy governing the flag and national anthem. The decision, perceived by some as an attempt to distance the country from Islam, stirred controversy that prompted the government to issue a clarification.    The government's Anti-Rumor Authority responded to the outcry by tweeting a statement denying ""the news circulating about changing the contents of the Saudi flag and national anthem."" The Saudi flag is inscribed with the Islamic testament of faith: ""there is no god but God; Mohammed is the Messenger of God"". Its color, green, is associated with Islam. Religion pervades most aspects of life in the kingdom, but its influence, as well as that of the clergy, has been significantly curtailed under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  Some of his reforms, including allowing gender mixing, concerts and lifting of restrictions on women, have been welcomed by some, but left others disgruntled in the birthplace of Islam. Some opponents of the flag policy change linked it to efforts at liberalizing the kingdom. Lawmaker Saad al-Otaibi, who presented the proposal to the council, explained that adjusting the policy would prevent desecration of the flag, local media reported. Changes include defining places and times of the flag's hoisting. The change was intended to align with the kingdom's ""path to modernity,"" he added.

The development comes after a new report by the business news website Calcalist alleging that phones belonging to, among others, several heads of government ministries, a leading businessman, a co-defendant in the trial of Benjamin Netanyahu, and even one of the former Prime Minister's sons, were infiltrated with Pegasus spyware.  It is the latest report by the website, which is linked to Israel's leading Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, detailing alleged police use of the NSO Group-made Pegasus software. Like its previous reporting on the story, the website did not provide any information about its sources, nor did it provide any dates when the alleged illegality took place.  Earlier Calcalist reports have focused on the alleged failure to seek authorization for the use of Pegasus but the latest allegations go much further by suggesting widespread surveillance of people under no suspicion of any wrong doing. ""Calcalist can reveal for the first time a list of dozens of citizens who were targeted by Israel Police, having their phones hacked by NSO spyware and their personal information swiped and filed away. The surveillance was conducted to phish for intelligence even before any investigation had been opened against the targets, and without judicial warrants,"" the article began. Israeli officials deny report that police are using cellphone spying software on citizens without court approvalRead MoreWithin hours of the report's publication, Israel's Public Security Minister, who has overall responsibility for the police, announced he was asking Cabinet colleagues to approve the establishment of a government commission of inquiry into the use of spyware and other electronic snooping technologies, ""to investigate in depth the violation of civil rights and their privacy in the years in question."" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett also commented, saying, ""The reports about Pegasus, if they are true, are very serious. This tool and similar tools, are important tools in the fight against terrorism and severe crime, but they were not intended to be used in phishing campaigns targeting the Israeli public or officials -- which is why we need to understand exactly what happened."" The allegations pile further pressure on Israel's police forces, which have been under fire since the first Calcalist report last month alleging use of Pegasus. Last week, in a vaguely-worded statement, police admitted that what they called ""additional findings"" from an internal investigation had been passed on to the Attorney General's office, which opened its own investigation into how Israeli police monitors electronic communications. Speaking on Israeli radio Monday morning, police spokesman Eli Levy insisted that all police actions investigated thus far had been carried out legally. ""Up to this point, there has been no known wrong-doing in the work of the police. We are transparent and open to any investigation,"" he said. ""If it is found that a police officer or an official wearing a uniform has committed a criminal offense, he will be prosecuted instantly."" Apple sues NSO Group over spywareAmong those whose phones were allegedly infected with Pegasus is Iris Elovitch, a co-defendant in the corruption trial of former Prime Minister Netanyahu. Lawyer Jack Chen, who is representing Elovitch's husband, Shaul, who is also on trial, said the revelations meant the trial should be suspended.  One of Netanyahu's senior Likud party colleagues, Yisrael Katz, echoed that sentiment on Twitter. ""In light of what has been exposed in the past few days, and this morning, I demand an immediate freeze of all of the legal proceedings against Binyamin Netanyahu ... A gross attempt was made here to topple an incumbent prime minister through illegal means and there is a grave threat to democracy in the State of Israel,"" Katz tweeted.    Proceedings in the trial, being held at Jerusalem's District Court, continued Monday as planned, though prosecutors were given until 7:00 p.m. to say whether the current witness, Dana Neufeld, a legal advisor at the Communications Ministry during the period in question, was among those under surveillance.

On the surface, the US commando raid in Syria that left ISIS chief Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi dead may look like a game-changer, but experts warn the resurgence of the group is likely to press on undeterred.  ""Thanks to the bravery of our troops, this horrible terrorist leader is no more,"" declared US President Joe Biden, hours after the end of the operation that targeted Qurayshi in the Syrian rebel enclave of Idlib.   Biden may have hoped for the same fanfare that greeted his predecessors when they took out ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before him. But ISIS experts were quick to throw cold water on claims of a significant blow to the group. Qurayshi is no Baghdadi, and a group that once commanded a piece of territory bigger than the United Kingdom is now a guerrilla insurgency with its leadership scattered.  But the group that delivered genocide, mass execution and oppression has proven that it remains a formidable force. A United Nations report released Friday said the terror group is far from vanquished. In fact, it remains a potent force in Iraq and Syria, with a growing presence in Afghanistan and West Africa, according to the UN analysis.The report -- compiled by UN experts on ISIS and al Qaeda before Qurayshi's death and covering the last six months of 2021 -- said ISIS may still have up to $50 million in its coffers.  Read MoreEven before his demise, according to the UN experts, ISIS had lost several important members of its senior echelon. And yet the group remains a threat. Instability in both Iraq and Syria ""indicate that an eventual ISIL resurgence in the core region cannot be ruled out,"" the report concludes, referring to the group by its alternate acronym.ISIS leader killed in US raid had dark past but spent years under the radarIn Iraq, ISIS stages attacks on an almost daily basis. In Lebanon, officials says it has found fertile recruiting ground in the city of Tripoli. And the United Nations says ISIS may still have $50 million in its coffers and up to 10,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq.  Last week ISIS launched its biggest attack in three years when the group's fighters attempted to free inmates from a prison in northeast Syria.  It lost the week-long standoff, and hundreds of ISIS inmates, including children, as well as scores of US-backed Kurdish fighters, died in the fighting. The uptick in ISIS violence has the region's security officials on edge, precisely because the picture is murkier  than it was in ISIS' heyday, when the group seized Mosul in 2014. Then, a US-led coalition, as well as Iran-backed Shia armed groups, fought years-long battles that ultimately led ISIS territory to vaporize. Now ISIS is virtually invisible. Its spread is detectable but appears to not have a single source.   For that reason, the US raid -- as dazzling as the optics may have been to some -- raises more questions than it answers. What was the ISIS leader doing in Idlib, where the group's ostensible rivals Hay'at Tahrir al Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate, dominates? How was he able to command cells further afield in Syria and Iraq?    Far from reassuring observers and security officials, the devil in the details of Thursday's operation seems to confirm what experts have been saying for months: Qurayshi was the head of a snake, but it will require a lot more sophistication and international cooperation to exterminate the pit from which he came.  Other top Middle East news France to reinforce UAE air defense system after drone attacks France said Friday it had agreed to reinforce the United Arab Emirates' defense system, including the deployment of Rafale jets, following Houthi attacks. Background: The UAE said Wednesday that it had intercepted three drones that entered its airspace. Top Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr blamed an obscure Iraq-based militia for targeting ""a Gulf state."" Why it matters: The UAE has been lobbying the international community for united front against the threats it faces from Iran-backed groups in the region, pushing the US to label the Houthis a terrorist group. The US also pledged to beef up air support for the UAE earlier last week. Denmark finds members of Iranian opposition group guilty of spying for Saudi Arabia A Danish court on Friday found three members of an Iranian Arab opposition group guilty of financing and supporting terrorist activity in Iran in collaboration with Saudi intelligence services, local news wire Ritzau reported. Background: The three members of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA) were arrested two years ago and have been in custody since.  Why it matters: A Norwegian-Iranian was sentenced to seven years in May last year for spying for an Iranian intelligence service and plotting to assassinate one of the ASMLA-members.

Around the region  Environmentally friendly ""flying"" boats may soon be hovering over Dubai's waters. Home to man-made islands, a marina and a creek, Dubai has a lot of boats. Now, the futuristic Gulf city is eyeing a cutting-edge addition to its marine landscape with the introduction of hydrofoil boats. While traditional boats float, hydrofoils, as the vessels are known, take advantage of the wind by lifting the hull above the water, thus reducing drag and increasing speed. Hydrofoils aren't new, but Dubai's version claims to be the first to have zero carbon emissions. ""We have already done it for roads, why not the water?"" said French yachtsman Alain Thébault, who has partnered with Swiss-based startup THE JET ZeroEmission to build the world's first hydrogen powered hydrofoil in Dubai.  His project fits right into the emirate's climate-friendly plans. Under its clean energy strategy, Dubai is aiming to produce three-quarters of its energy requirements from clean sources by 2050. The boat is expected to glide in silence above the city's waters at up to 46 miles per hour, with a capacity of up to 12 passengers, by next year, when the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is part, plans to host the 28th International Climate Summit, known as COP28.

meast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/middleeast/bahrain-natural-pearls-industry-spc-intl/index.html,Eco-friendly and ultra-luxury: How Bahrain hopes to revive its natural pearl industry,"By Nadia Leigh-Hewitson, CNN"," (CNN)An island kingdom just off the Arabian Peninsula, known as the first emirate nation to discover oil in 1932, wants to re-establish itself as the global center for sustainable pearls.Natural pearls are one of the most sustainable and ethical luxury gems, both conflict-free and climate-friendly. With pearl beds bigger than Manhattan, Bahrain is looking to revive its traditional pearl industry -- once the backbone of the country's economy.For centuries, Bahrainis have free-dived to collect pearl oysters from the sea floor. ""Most families, before the discovery of oil in Bahrain, were associated with the trade of pearling -- from merchants to divers, drillers, dealers,"" says Faten Ebrahim Mattar, a sixth-generation pearl merchant from the Mattar family, which has been in the business since the 1850s. ""Working in the natural pearl business is one of the toughest trades, due to the rarity of your star element,"" she says.According to Mattar, Bahrain has a reputation as the ""Mecca of Pearling."" In 2012 UNESCO declared the Bahraini pearl beds a World Heritage site, calling the region the ""last remaining complete example of the cultural tradition of pearling and the wealth it generated at a time when the trade dominated the Gulf economy.""Read MoreBahrain has a long and lucrative history of pearling. Pictured: pearl merchants show off their wares in March 1953.""Our geographic location as an island in the middle of the trade route from Iraq to India attributed to Bahrain being an important marketplace for this business,"" says Mattar. She adds that some marine biologists believe that convergence of saltwater with fresh natural springs in the middle of the Gulf creates a unique environment for pearls to grow with high luster.Though the value of the natural pearl plummeted after the advent of cultured pearls in Japan in the early 1900s, the gems are experiencing a renaissance as consumers look for more responsibly sourced jewelry and one-of-a-kind pieces. Natural pearls as ""ultra-luxury""At the beginning of the 20th century, to own a perfectly shaped pearl was a sign of extravagant wealth. Though a pearl necklace may no longer be traded for a New York townhouse, today natural pearl jewelry can fetch upwards of $300,000 at auction with some historic pieces selling for up to $32 million.Natural pearls occur when a foreign object -- such as a grain of sand, or parasite -- finds its way inside a pearl oyster. To protect itself, the oyster produces an iridescent mineral substance to engulf the object.With natural pearls occurring in only 1 in 10,000 oysters and each one growing organically over several years into a unique shape, every natural pearl is both rare and inimitable.Unlike cultivated pearls from farms, which often involves deliberately inserting a foreign object (usually a bead) into the oyster and can be damaging to the environment, Bahrain's natural pearls develop without any human interference.Collection is done in the least obtrusive way with licensed divers carefully gathering oysters by hand, says Noora Jamsheer, CEO of the Bahrain Institute for Pearls and Gemstones (DANAT), which was established in 2017 to support a national plan to revive the pearl sector.Natural pearls occur in only 1 in 10,000 oysters and pearl divers must gather them by hand.In collaboration with the Supreme Council for the Environment and the Coast Guard, DANAT monitors and shields the health of the pearl beds, periodically suspending diving in certain areas to allow for growth. The institute tests and certifies the pearls and offers hands-on pearl grading education.Despite being impacted by the pandemic, DANAT says the natural pearl market is seeing steady growth. According to the institute, all parts of the industry in Bahrain have grown in the last year, and 2021 saw significant growth in the number of pearl diving licenses issued -- including, for the first time, licenses being given to female pearl divers.""We saw a strong rebound in 2021 in the growth in the luxury market,"" says Jamsheer. ""We're not talking about the Guccis and the Louis Vuittons; it's happening in the sector of ultra-luxury, extremely exclusive, one of a kind -- and this is where natural pearls fall.""Back in styleThe greatest challenge to the natural pearl market today is the cultured pearl, says Kenneth Scarratt, president of the International Confederation of Jewelry (CIBJO) Pearl Commission.Scarratt, a world-renowned expert who has worked in the pearl sector for 50 years and helped run DANAT when the institute first launched, says that the crash in value of the natural pearl was caused by the advent of cultured pearls in Japan, followed by the Great Depression in the 1930s.""Once the Great Depression was over, the cultured pearl business had grown exponentially,"" says Scarratt. ""The super-rich were no longer buying pearls, but cultured pearls were an affordable option for the ordinary person.""To the untrained eye, cultured pearls are indistinguishable from natural ones. With natural pearls making millions at auction and their cultured counterpart available for as little as $50, it's easy to see why consumers would opt for the perfect imitation.Tiffany is selling its most expensive piece of jewelry everBut Scarratt says he has seen interest in natural pearls rematerialize over the past decade. ""There's a growing segment of the market that looks out for what is rare. That segment of the market is looking for natural pearls,"" he explains.Scarratt says most of the pearls found in Bahrain are ""seed pearls,"" small pearls used in intricate jewelry designs and high fashion garments. ""They have a particularly nice appearance,"" he adds.These Bahraini seed pearls are back in demand as new jewelry houses emerge and established jewelers start to reimagine natural pearls in contemporary designs.""The generations who came after the birth of cultivated pearls, who haven't been exposed to natural pearls, don't necessarily know the difference between a cultivated and a natural pearl,"" says Mattar. ""Our biggest goal is to educate the world on the alluring beauty of the natural pearl, especially Bahraini pearls, by introducing new concepts and creating world class jewelry that instil the love of this gem."""

When Qurayshi took over the organization, the vast swathes of territory the group controlled -- an area larger than the size of the United Kingdom at its peak -- had largely vaporized. Observers dubbed him a Caliph without a Caliphate. Yet he sought to reinvigorate the organization. In recent months, he oversaw a resurgence of ISIS in various parts of Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Iraq reported an uptick in violence linked to ISIS. In the Kurdish-controlled northeastern part of Syria, the group staged a lethal days-long attempted jail break in a bid to free ISIS members. Hundreds of inmates, including children, died. Scores of Kurdish fighters also perished in the clashes. In Lebanon, multiple regional and local reports have indicated that the group has been recruiting scores of  members from the northern city of Tripoli, one of the areas hardest hit by the country's devastating economic crisis. Read MoreThroughout it all, Qurayshi -- who was known by several aliases -- kept a low profile, much like his predecessor. The US Rewards for Justice program offered a reward of $10 million for information about him. His history in the organization is also murky. But snippets from interviews with ISIS prisoners paint a picture of a man with a dark past as a member of Baghdadi's inner-most circle. Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi killed himself and his family after igniting a bomb at the beginning of the operation, according to a senior Pentagon official. Qurayshi became a ""religious scholar"" with al Qaeda in Iraq, before the group rebranded itself as the Islamic State. In 2014, he ""helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of the Yazidi religious minority in northwest Iraq,"" the Rewards for Justice notice says. Much of the Yazidi community lived in an area close to what some analysts believe was Qurayshi's home town of Tal Afar in northern Iraq. In 2014, after ISIS had taken Tal Afar and Mosul, the group enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and children and murdered thousands of Yazidi men, in what the United Nations has called a genocide. The Commission for International Justice and Accountability, an NGO that investigates and gathers evidence of major international crimes such as terrorism, said Qurayshi was ""one of the key architects of the Islamic State slave trade in Yazidi women and children.""""He personally enslaved and raped captive women,"" said Nerma Jelacic, the group's deputy director. Counter-terrorism expert Daniele Raineri has noted that he was ""the deputy who managed to spend the years since 2010 almost totally under the radar."" But when others in the ISIS hierarchy were taken or died in battle, he became one of the group's leading ideologues. In a 2018 interview with Saudi-owned al Arabiya, a senior ISIS detainee in Iraq, Ismael al Eithawi called Qurayshi ""the most prominent of Baghdadi's surrounding circle."" A 2018 internal ISIS document repeatedly describes Qurayshi as ""the deputy"" to Baghdadi. He died in an operation similar to that which killed Baghdadi. And it is yet unclear if the operation will stem the group's resurgence or if the cycle of extremist violence will continue undeterred. ISIS has not acknowledged his death and it's as yet unclear who may replace him. Few if any of Baghdadi's inner circle are thought to be still at large.CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report."

Erdogan accused the rights group, the Council of Europe, of ignoring its sovereignty on Thursday, saying: ""We do not recognize those who do not recognize our courts. We expect our own courts to be respected. We are sorry but we will not respect those who do not respect us."" In October, Erdogan ordered the ambassadors of 10 countries, including the United States, France and Germany, to be declared persona non grata after calling for Kavala's release.Kavala is among Turkey's most high-profile detainees. He was first arrested in 2017 on charges related to the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul. The trial was closely watched by rights groups, who had accused the Turkish government of using the judicial system to crack down on dissenting voices. Though Kavala was acquitted in 2020, that verdict was overturned and new charges were brought against him for his alleged involvement in the 2016 attempted coup.Turkey's president has ordered 10 ambassadors to be declared 'persona non grata' for backing jailed activistThe Council of Europe said in a Wednesday statement its decision to move forward with infringement proceedings against Turkey, a founding member of the organization, ""clearly indicates the serious concerns related with the case of Mr. Kavala, who has been kept in prison for years without a conviction."" Read More""Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU's concerns regarding Turkish judiciary's adherence to international and European standards,"" it said.The European Court of Human Rights had previously ruled that Kavala's detention ""took place in the absence of sufficient evidence"" and ordered his release. Kavala has denied the charges levied against him. His lawyer, lkan Koyuncu, said Thursday that espionage charges leveled against Kavala were ""fabricated."" ""Osman Kavala's pre-trial detention for four years and three months is a disgrace to the judiciary,"" Koyuncu said. Rights groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International applauded the Council's decision. ""The message from the Committee of Ministers today is clear: Turkey must release Osman Kavala and end his politically motivated persecution,"" Nils Muižnieks, Amnesty International's Europe director, said in a statement Wednesday."

It's unclear to whom the drones belonged. Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, a possible culprit, have not claimed responsibility. The UAE is a member of the Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Houthis since 2015. The coalition has been fighting to restore Yemen's internationally recognized government after it was ousted by Houthi forces, who now control much of the country.In 2019, the UAE pulled most of its troops from Yemen, after privately deeming the war unwinnable. The campaign failed to crush the rebels and exacted a huge humanitarian toll. Read MoreUS, UAE intercepts ballistic missile during Israeli President's visitThe UAE had largely avoided the firing line, with Houthis opting instead to strike Saudi Arabia until recently. The Houthis have launched a series of attacks on the Emiratis, beginning with a January 17 drone strike that killed three foreign workers in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The Saudi-led coalition responded with a weeklong offensive in Yemen, killing scores of people and knocking out the internet. In recent days, Houthi forces have launched several ballistic missiles aimed at US and UAE forces deployed in the country -- including one attack that came during Israeli President Isaac Herzog's historic visit to the country. The missiles launched in those attacks were intercepted by US-deployed Patriot missile defense systems, and there were no casualties. On Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed that the US would be deploying fifth-generation fighters to assist against the Houthi threat. The move was welcomed by the UAE.The UAE has also been lobbying the US to redesignate the Houthis as a foreign terror organization, which US President Joe Biden said is ""under consideration.""January's attacks have surprised residents of the UAE. Abu Dhabi has repeatedly been ranked one of the safest cities in the world. For decades, the UAE staved off turbulence in a crisis-ridden region, attracting millions of expatriates and large volumes of foreign investment. CNN's Becky Anderson contributed reporting."
meast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/middleeast/israel-apartheid-amnesty-intl/index.html,"Amnesty accuses Israel of apartheid over treatment of Palestinians, prompting angry response","By Andrew Carey, CNN","Jerusalem (CNN)Amnesty International has become the latest human rights organization to accuse Israel of apartheid for its treatment of Palestinians, prompting an angry response from Israel, which has denounced the report as anti-Semitic. Amnesty's nearly 300-page report, released Tuesday, details ""inhuman or inhumane acts of forcible transfer, administrative detention, torture, unlawful killings and serious injuries, and the denial of basic rights and freedoms or persecution committed against the Palestinian population,"" creating ""an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination over Palestinians."" ""Amnesty International concludes that the State of Israel considers and treats Palestinians as an inferior non-Jewish racial group,"" it said. Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, told CNN's Becky Anderson on Tuesday that ""we call it apartheid because it is apartheid under international law.""""What we have found is a system, a system of laws, policies, practices, intricate bureaucratic bureaucratized, that are there in order to ensure control and domination of the Palestinian people,"" Callamard said.Read MoreLike two recent reports focusing on the same issue -- from Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, and from New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) -- Amnesty's report examines Israeli policy in both the Palestinian territories, land occupied by Israel since 1967 but never formally annexed, and in Israel. Israeli settlers rage through Palestinian town, marking the latest 'nationalistically motivated' attack in the region""Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has pursued an explicit policy of establishing and maintaining a Jewish demographic hegemony and maximizing its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis,"" it said. Even before the report was formally released, Israel denounced it as ""false and biased."" In an online briefing with journalists held in advance of the report's publication, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said that Amnesty was ""using double standards and demonization in order to delegitimize the existence of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people."" ""These are the exact components from which modern antisemitism is made,"" the foreign ministry said in a separate statement. That response was echoed in a joint statement by several Jewish groups in the United States on Sunday, including the American Israel Israeli Public Affairs Committee and the Anti-Defamation League, which said Amnesty's document ""fuels those anti-Semites around the world who seek to undermine the only Jewish country on earth, while simultaneously cheapening and downplaying the horrific suffering that was a result of apartheid in South Africa."" Callamard responded to these criticisms by telling CNN that ""going after the messenger is one way of ensuring that there is no discussion on the substance, we need to focus on the reality of life for Palestinians. Amnesty stand by its report and stand by its right to critique Israel every time Israel violates international law. That is not anti-Semitic.""The term apartheid originated in South Africa, where a system of racial segregation and ""separate development"" was official policy between 1948 and 1994. The system was designed to confine non-Whites to ""self-governing Bantustans,"" stripping them of their citizenship, with a system of passes and identity papers controlling where non-Whites could travel and work. Israel has always rejected comparisons with apartheid-era South Africa. Even some staunch Israeli critics of the occupation have argued that discrimination against Palestinians does not amount to intentional or institutional racism and is the result of genuine security fears. Clash over wordsThis clash over words -- and the efforts to make them stick -- have increasingly come to characterize perceptions of the conflict from within the region and abroad.  While the Israeli government response to the previous B'Tselem and HRW reports was critical, Haiat acknowledged concerns that the apartheid narrative is building, prompting a more combative approach this time. ""Of course, there is a concern that people will believe those false accusations,"" Haiat said. He pointed to Israel's current government, which for the first time includes Arab lawmakers in its ranks as proof of what he termed Israel's inclusive democracy.  But many Palestinian activists believe those arguments are no longer cutting through, and the see the tide of public opinion turning in their favor. Israel announces plan to double Golan Heights population, drawing condemnation from SyriaThey point to demonstrations in the United States and around the world last year in support of Palestinian families facing the threat of forced eviction from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. ""The world is coming to the conclusion that for human beings that live in the land between the river and the sea, the levels of freedoms and rights are defined by ethnonational identity,"" Salem Barahmeh, Executive Director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy told CNN.The charge of anti-Semitism by Israel's defenders has also become a highly contested issue. While research clearly points to rising anti-Semitism around the world, many feel the word is being mis-used and devalued. Israel's former ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, was ridiculed recently after accusing actress Emma Watson of anti-Semitism after she posted online a picture of a pro-Palestinian rally alongside the words, ""Solidarity is a verb."" ""No joke, we are at the point where merely posting a vague picture referencing solidarity with Palestinians on Instagram gets you labeled as an antisemite,"" MSNBC host and former CNN journalist Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted.  At the level of international diplomacy, though, there is little sign so far that the battle over the apartheid label is having much of an impact.  On Tuesday, the US pushed back at the Amnesty report's characterization of Israel.  US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a briefing that the department ""(rejects) the view that Israel's actions constitute apartheid."" ""We certainly reject the label that has been attached to this (report),"" Price said, adding: ""We think that it is important as the world's only Jewish state that the Jewish people must not be denied their right to self-determination and we must ensure there isn't a double standard being applied.""US, UAE intercepts ballistic missile during Israeli President's visitThe report also coincided with the first ever trip by an Israeli head of state to the United Arab Emirates -- underscoring Israel's recent diplomatic achievements.

Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani became the first Gulf Arab leader to visit the Biden White House on Monday. It's a trip that underscores the tiny state's unrelenting ambition to remain a key international player and its ability to walk back from the brink five years after a regional embargo risked turning it into a Middle East backwater.  In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut off diplomatic and economic ties with Doha, accusing it of cozying up to their adversaries including Islamist groups and Iran. Then-President Donald Trump appeared to take credit for the move, and it seemed as though it was only a matter of time before Doha caved, with its regional clout diminished.  But Qatar persevered, and its fortunes have now seemingly turned. It will be the third Gulf country after Kuwait and Bahrain to be designated the title of major non-NATO ally, granted to close friends that have strategic working relationships with the US military. ""I think it's long overdue,"" Biden said.  Ironically, the very policies Qatar was demonized for by its neighbors may have been what catapulted it back into the international limelight.  Read MoreIn 2020, Qatar brokered Washington's talks with the Taliban, a fruit of the decades long, often controversial ties it maintained with the extremist group. Those talks served as a precursor to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Doha also cushioned the botched exit last year by facilitating evacuations and became a hub for travel to Kabul.  Doha's cordial ties with Tehran also appear to have paid off. As Iran and the US arrive at a critical juncture in negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, Doha seems to be engaging in shuttle diplomacy. Sheikh Tamim's visit to Washington comes just days after his top diplomat visited Tehran. It's unclear if the emir was carrying a message. Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of liquified natural gas, is also playing a role in another global flashpoint offering to help with contingency planning in case of disruptions to energy supplies in Europe should Russia invade Ukraine.  The contrast between the Biden and Trump administrations' view of the Gulf couldn't be starker. Trump made history by picking Saudi Arabia for his first overseas trip and his family forged close ties with de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. A year into his presidency, Biden is yet to have a phone call with the prince.  The digest  UAE to introduce corporate tax rate The United Arab Emirates is introducing its first ever federal corporate tax on business profits in June 2023, as the country seeks to realign with newly introduced global taxation standards. The standard statutory tax rate will be 9%, but 0% on profits up to Dh375,000 ($102,000) ""to support small businesses and startups"". Background: The Gulf oil exporter had previously only imposed corporate tax on oil companies and banks. In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) introduced a deal, agreed by 136 countries -- including the UAE -- that ensured multinational enterprises worldwide will become subject to a minimum 15% tax rate from 2023. Why it matters: The UAE has long benefited from its tax-free status to carve out a role as an international commercial, energy and tourism hub. The move will be seen as its first step to committing to the OECD target.  US says Iran talks entering 'final stretch' It's time for the US and Iran to start making tough political decisions as talks on a nuclear agreement enter the ""final stretch,"" a senior State Department official said Monday. Some of the most critical decisions are yet to be made, he said.Background: A landmark deal was reached between the two countries in 2015 aimed at reining in Iran's nuclear program. The Trump administration pulled out of the deal in 2018; President Biden has promised to reenter the deal, but a conclusive agreement has not yet been reached.Why it matters: This could be the closest the two sides have been to reaching a new deal, and only a handful of weeks remain to conclude it, considering Iran's pace of nuclear production, said the US official. UAE intercepts Houthi missile during Israeli president's visit The United Arab Emirates blocked a Houthi missile attack, intercepting the projectile and destroying it on Monday. The third such attack in the last fortnight came during Israeli President Isaac Herzog's first visit to the Gulf state.Background: Monday's attempted strike comes after a drone attack on Abu Dhabi which killed three foreign workers, along with another foiled missile attack. All three were claimed by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are fighting a Saudi-led coalition. Why it matters: Life has continued as normal in the UAE since the assaults began, but repeated strikes could quell expat appetite to stay in the country.

This time, however, female spectators were allowed to attend for the first time in three years.  About 2,000 women watched the qualifying match at Tehran's Azadi stadium, only the second time for women to attend a major game since the 1979 Islamic revolution. They were seated in a female-only section and entered through a designated area. The move found support from none other than Ahmad Khomeini, the great grandson of the founder of the Islamic regime that banned female spectators from sporting events.

Iran is the only country in the world to ban women from attending football and other sports in stadiums, according to Human Rights Watch.

""According to the detainees who we interrogated at the first moments of the operation, the operation was prepared and planned for six months.""More than 100 ISIS fighters launched the assault on Ghweran prison in Hasakah on Thursday, detonating three car bombs before storming into the complex in an attempt to break out thousands of their comrades, many of whom were detained after the group's 2019 defeat.A Humvee patrols in Hasakah, northeast Syria, on Monday amid ongoing clashes between US-backed Kurdish forces and ISIS.Read MoreThe SDF, which oversee Ghweran prison, said the ISIS fighters struck local forces standing guard outside, while the militants inside burned blankets and plastic items ""in an attempt to create chaos."" The Kurdish-led forces, a key US partner in the fight against ISIS, said they ""thwarted"" the attempted jailbreak hours after it began. However, clashes were still ongoing near the facility until Wednesday, when the group's spokesman, Farhad Shami, said that all ISIS fighters and prisoners had surrendered.There was ""mass surrendering of ISIS prisoners,"" Shami added.He also shared videos on Twitter which appeared to show hundreds of prisoners in orange jumpsuits gathered in a courtyard, with the walls behind them blackened from the fighting. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that the US-led coalition had moved in armored Bradley fighting vehicles to support the SDF, indicating that US ground forces were involved in the fight. The Bradleys were being used to help establish an inner and an outer perimeter around the prison facility, while the SDF closed in on ISIS fighters, according to US military officials.""We have provided limited ground support, strategically positioned to assist security in the area,"" John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters in Washington.  This photo provided by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces shows some ISIS fighters who were arrested.Coalition forces also supported the operation with airstrikes, including the precision targeting of ISIS fighters who were attacking SDF positions from the cover of nearby buildings.No US service members were injured during the fighting, a defense official said, although the SDF suffered some losses. Dozens of fighters with the SDF and ISIS are estimated to have been killed in the fighting.Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), the US-led coalition mission to defeat ISIS, said in a statement Tuesday that the recent ISIS escape attempt ""will not pose a significant threat to Iraq or the region."" It added that assessments are ongoing to see if ISIS is planning any future attacks on Ghweran or other prison facilities throughout Syria or Iraq.""Due to its severely degraded capability, Daesh's future survival is dependent on its ability to refill its ranks through poorly-conceived attempts like the Hasakah attack,"" said Maj. Gen. John W. Brennan, Jr., the commander of the OIR Combined Joint Task Force.Some 11,000 to 12,000 ISIS fighters are held in northern Syria in prisons and detention camps run by the SDF. Deadly ISIS prison break attempt fuels fears of the group's resurgenceWhile this is not the first such prison break attempt -- several escaped from the same facility in 2020 by ripping off doors and using them to destroy a wall -- concerns are mounting that the timing and audacity of the attack may indicate the terror group's renewed strength.Although there is little fear that ISIS will reclaim its former physical territory, which, at its peak, stretched from the outskirts of Baghdad to western Syria and encompassed more than 10 million people, the terror group has been mobilizing thousands of its remaining fighters in recent years. In 2019, just as US-backed forces retook the final ISIS stronghold in Syria, and only a year after Iraq declared victory against the group, intelligence sources and international monitors were already noticing an increase in ISIS activity and attacks in the region.A wide-ranging report released in 2020 by the UN Monitoring Team, which tracks the global jihadi terror threat, warned that ISIS was beginning to reassert itself in Iraq and Syria. It said the group was ""mounting increasingly bold insurgent attacks, calling and planning for the breakout of ISIL [ISIS] fighters in detention facilities and exploiting weaknesses in the security environment of both countries.""In recent months, Iraqi security forces and commanders have also warned that ISIS sleeper cells are continuing to stage attacks.Following a deadly ambush on an Iraqi military post near Baghdad last Friday, Iraqi President Barham Salih tweeted: ""Certainly, the attempts to revive terrorism in the region cannot be underestimated.""CNN's Oren Liebermann, Ellie Kaufman, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Joshua Berlinger contributed to this report."

This is the first firing by the US of Patriot missiles since April 2003, according to CENTCOM. ""The combined efforts successfully prevented both missiles from impacting the base. There were no U.S. casualties,"" CENTCOM said.The attack was the second in a week aimed at the UAE, which is a member of the Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels for years, and marked a significant escalation in tensions. The UAE has largely avoided the firing line, with Houthis opting instead to strike Saudi Arabia, which borders Yemen.CNN reported earlier that the UAE intercepted two ballistic missiles launched by Houthis early Monday, in what the Iran-backed group warned would be part of a continuous campaign to target the Emirati capital.Read MoreAt 4:15 a.m. Abu Dhabi's skyline lit up with what witnesses described as ""fireballs in the sky."" Some of the capital's residents woke to the sound of explosions as air defense missiles intercepted the projectiles. The incident comes a week after a Houthi drone and missile attack near Abu Dhabi's airport killed three foreign workers and injured several others.  In a statement Monday, the UAE Ministry of Defense said, ""its air defense has intercepted and destroyed two ballistic missiles fired by the terrorist Houthi group.""""The attack did not result in any casualties, as the remnants of the intercepted and destroyed ballistic missiles fell in separate areas around the Emirate of Abu Dhabi,"" the statement added.A drone attack in Abu Dhabi could mark a dangerous turning point for the Middle East. Here's what to knowThe ministry said it is ""ready to deal with any threats, and that it takes all necessary measures to protect the state from all attacks.""Several flights were delayed arriving into Abu Dhabi airport, according to the airport's website. Flight tracking website Flightradar24 showed Abu Dhabi-bound planes flying in circles near the airport. The US embassy in Abu Dhabi also called on US citizens in the UAE to maintain a ""high level of security awareness,"" issuing a series of instructions on how to respond to a missile attack. Shortly after Monday's incident in Abu Dhabi, the UAE's Ministry of Defense said an F-16 fighter jet had destroyed the ballistic missile launcher used to target the UAE capital. It did not specify what country the aircraft belonged to. Yemen's Houthis claimed they were targeting the UAE's commercial hub of Dubai as well as Abu Dhabi's Al Dhafra airbase, which hosts the United States Air Force's 380th Air Expeditionary Wing. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree on Monday warned that the group would ""expand their operations over the next phase."" ""We are calling on foreign companies and investors to leave the UAE,"" Saree said in a video statement. ""It is subject to continuous targeting."" Abu Dhabi has repeatedly been ranked one of the safest cities in the world, with the January 17 strike considered ""unprecedented"" by Emirati officials. For decades, the UAE staved off turbulence in the crisis-ridden region, attracting millions of expatriates and large volumes of foreign investment. The country's economy relies heavily on a foreign workforce. An escalation in week-long violenceYemen's Houthis had vowed to retaliate for a series of deadly airstrikes over the last week by the Saudi-led coalition -- of which the UAE is a major partner -- in northern Yemen which killed scores of people. The airstrikes also knocked out the internet nationwide after hitting a telecommunications tower. A nation-wide internet outage entered its fourth day in Yemen on Monday, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks. On Friday, at least 70 people were killed in an airstrike on a detention center in the Yemeni city of Saada, according to international aid groups. The Saudi-led coalition denied it deliberately targeted the detention center, with its spokesman Brig. Gen. Turki Al-Maliki calling the claims ""baseless and unfounded,"" according to Saudi state news agency SPA.The coalition did say it had hit Hodeidah, taking down ""one of the [Houthis'] dens of maritime piracy and organized crime."" The coalition also said it attacked ""military targets"" in Sanaa. Last week's offensive began after last Monday's attack in Abu Dhabi. The United Nations Security Council last Friday unanimously condemned the January 17 strike in the UAE capital. The UAE is a major coalition partner that has been fighting in a six-year Saudi-led military campaign to crush the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, which control much of Yemen. The offensive began in 2015 to restore Yemen's internationally recognized government, after it was ousted by the Houthis. The coalition has intensified its attacks in the war-torn nation in the wake of the Houthi missile and drone strike in Abu Dhabi last week. In 2019, the UAE pulled most of its troops from Yemen, after privately deeming the war unwinnable. The campaign failed to crush the rebels but exacted a huge humanitarian toll, with thousands of Yemenis dead and malnourishment and disease widespread.More recently, the UAE has returned to the conflict, backing Yemeni groups in flashpoints like the oil-rich provinces of Shabwa and Marib.Correction: A previous version of this article quoted a US senior defense official who had incorrectly stated the last time Patriot missiles were fired. It was in April 2003."

He called on all members of his Future Movement party, which make up the country's largest Sunni parliamentary bloc, to do the same.Hariri said that neither he nor any members of his party would run for parliamentary elections, scheduled for May 2022.Hariri leaves a vacuum in Sunni leadership, in a country with a delicate confessional power-sharing system that hangs in the balance. Multiple local media outlets have reported that Hariri's allies and foes have tried to talk him out of the move.Lebanon is in the throes of a financial tailspin, exacerbated by a series of political stalemates centered on corruption, confessional power-sharing disputes and the the question of Iran-backed Hezbollah's arms.

With little political experience, he took on the mantle of Sunni leadership. What followed was a period rife with violence, including a war with Israel and a string of political assassinations -- as well as economic crises.  Hariri was backed by Saudi Arabia for most of his political career. His political allegiances pitted him against the militant and political group Hezbollah, in a rivalry that shaped Lebanon's political scene for nearly two decades. In 2017, Riyadh unofficially withdrew support for Hariri.In November 2017, Saudi Arabia temporarily detained the prime minister and had him resign under duress, according to multiple sources, Hariri since returned to the premiership but, without Riyadh's patronage, saw a steady decline in his political power. In October 2019, a popular uprising against Lebanon's political establishment toppled his third government.At the close of his speech on Monday, a visibly emotional Hariri cited his father's resignation speech just before his assassination. ""Finally, the best words for this moment are what Rafik Hariri said in his statement of absention 17 years ago. 'I entrust to God the Almighty this beloved country Lebanon and its kind people,"" said Hariri, choking on tears. ""And I express my heartfelt thanks to all of those who cooperated with me during this last period.'"""

The entrepreneur and co-founder of Reddit was in London and his friend wanted him to come to Paris, ""He's like, you're an idiot if you don't come down to watch the USA play France.""Shortly afterwards, Ohanian was alongside 45,000 other fans, watching Megan Rapinoe score twice for the US women's national team in the quarterfinal of the Women's World Cup, leading her country towards what would be a fourth world title.  ""It was admittedly the first time I'd ever been to a women's football match,"" he told CNN Sport, ""and the crowd was electric.

Ohanian is a lead investor on a new Los Angeles soccer project led by the Hollywood actress and activist Natalie Portman.The National Women's Soccer League was formed in 2013 with just five teams, four have been added since and the league will hit double figures in 2021 when Racing Louisville FC join in. The following season, Angel City will make it 11 teams in the league. According to Angel City's President Julie Uhrman, the idea for this new team came during Portman's involvement with Time's Up, a movement established in 2018 to combat sexual harassment.  ""You can see that she really gets behind causes that are important to her and she does meaningful work for those causes,"" Uhrman told CNN Sport, adding: ""she wanted to take her commitment to elevate women's athletics, to address pay equity and to make it public and meaningful.""  Promoting Angel City's launch in July, Portman spoke about the challenges which have traditionally held back women's sports. She was talking on Instagram with somebody who's experienced it first hand for the last 20 years -- Williams.  ""Our team told me that only 4% of sports coverage is of women's sport,"" Portman said, ""it's insane that we're here in 2020 and it's so disproportionate.""

But already it's clear that those behind the club are doing things differently.For one, the founding investors are almost exclusively women, ""I think you can count the number of clubs that are mainly owned by women on one hand and probably with only a couple of fingers,"" Uhrman told CNN, ""I mean, it's very unusual."" Listed on the club's website are the 31 founding investors and only four are men; Alexis Ohanian is one of those odd-men out.He described an early meeting with Uhrman, Portman and venture capitalist Kara Nortman, ""the three of them sat down and said, 'this is what we want to build, this is how we want to build it,' and it was really important to them from day one to have a majority women-owned team. ""I think we can talk about so many of the disparities in professional sports. And I think one of the ways we get real change is not just proving that this is an amazing business that will generate lots of money and lots of attention and lots of success, but it's also showing that every bit of how this organization is run can be different and be as, if not more successful as a result.""And not because it feels good, although it does feel good, but because it's preposterous that it is not more normal."" The club knows that they are trying to swim against the tide, and not just because they're hoping to change the perception of professional women's sport; they're also launching a club in a Los Angeles sports market that is already saturated. US-Israeli actress Natalie Portman arrives for the 92nd Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California on February 9, 2020.READ: Natalie Portman and Serena Williams are among investors behind Angel CityCrowded marketUhrman rattles off the clubs that they'll soon be rubbing shoulders with in a city famed for congestion, ""Los Angeles is a market where there is already nine professional sports teams and [collegiate] powerhouses like University of Southern California and University of California, Los Angeles.So even the idea of bringing another professional sports team here, the third soccer club here, is an ambitious, big idea."" But Angel City believes that their novel approach will cut through the noise, establishing a local, community, club with global appeal. ""We know women's soccer has been incredibly successful during the Olympics and World Cup,"" Uhrman says,""The question is, why is it every four years that they garner such attention? And I think the answer is because of exposure and awareness."" Behind the key investors is a supporting cast of Hollywood stars, including Jennifer Garner, Eva Longoria and Jessica Chastain, plus Serena Williams and 14 former players on the US women's national team; it's a group of women with tens of millions of followers on social media; they're going to use their collective platforms to shout it from the rooftops.  ""There's this general issue that if you can't see it,"" Uhrman says, ""You can't be it. If you can't see it, you can't follow it. [If] you can't cheer for it, you can't get your friend to become a part of it, and so there's a systemic problem that we have to fix and change."" Founder of OUYA Julie Uhrman speaks onstage at the Julie Uhrman + Josh Topolsky Keynote during the 2013 SXSW Music, Film + Interactive Festival at Austin Convention Center on March 11, 2013 in Austin, Texas.Uhrman continues, ""We have a group of people that come from the entertainment space, the media space, sports and the technology space. We're thinking about soccer as bigger than sports, in fact we're thinking about it as entertainment."" Ohanian says the focus will be on social media storytelling to build the brand and it already seems to be working, ""tens of thousands of folks are very excited, [we've] sold out merchandise for a team that doesn't exist yet."" He compares women's soccer to e-sports, which drew a rush of investment five years ago, and has concluded that the market has massively undervalued female soccer.""These are clubs of gamers, young men who draw hundreds of millions of fans all over the world. [But] the average American does not know who the best League of Legends player is, whereas Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan are already cultural icons.""From a marketing standpoint, no offense to e-sports, they're far more marketable for brands who want to be aligned with consumer spending in this country."" In her conversation with Williams on Instagram, Portman remarked that already, Angel City has changed the conversation, ""people are starting to think about how to do this in other sports too.""  Women are standing up for and elevating other women; the sisters are doing it for themselves. It's an LA Story that could have a Hollywood ending and it's a potential game-changer for women's sports everywhere."
football,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/15/football/mason-greenwood-manchester-united-europa-league-spt-intl-cmd/index.html,The Man Utd teenager who is a superstar in the making,"By Aimee Lewis, CNN"," (CNN)There was a period during the winter of 2008 when every Saturday night Paul Newsham's Yorkshire home would sound like old telephone exchange switch room. ""That'll be someone ringing about Mason, to see if he will be playing,"" his wife Julie would say every time the phone rang. The callers were scouts, inquiring as to whether Mason Greenwood, the six-year-old who would develop into Manchester United's prodigiously talented striker, would be featuring the next day for the boys' team Newsham coached in the north of England, Idle FC. Greenwood has, clearly, always made an impression on the pitch.How Bruno Fernandes transformed Manchester United's fortunesSince those carefree days as a lightning quick striker playing near his hometown of Bradford, the 18-year-old has become an integral member of an improving United, scoring goals, helping the team rise up the league and, over the last month, talked about as the next great English talent. Read MoreHe may also help United reach the Europa League final, should Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men overcome Sevilla in Sunday's semifinal. Scoring 10 league goals in an impressive debut season, Greenwood is only the third teenager to score 10 or more English Premier League goals in a single campaign.Former England captain Alan Shearer has said Greenwood could usurp him as the EPL's record scorer. According to former Liverpool player and now football pundit Jamie Redknapp, those at United who have worked with the teenager say he's one of the best the club has ever seen, while another former England star, Gary Lineker, has said it ""won't be long"" until Greenwood is selected by England manager Gareth Southgate. The list of admirers seems endless. But those who follow United closely have known about a young player called Greenwood coming through the ranks for years. Hyperbole and excitement has followed the player from a young age.'A different level to everyone else'As a six-year-old playing for Idle FC's under-7s, it was the young Greenwood's pace that stood out, recalls Newsham. Shy and small in stature, Greenwood also had an eye for goal, shooting on sight, just as he did for United post-lockdown as the team secured a lucrative Champions League spot by finishing third in the league.  A few days after his sixth birthday, Greenwood made his debut for Idle FC in a match against Silsden Football and Cricket Club, scoring all 10 goals in a 10-1 win. ""I kept having to bring him off because once you had 10 goals you had to stop the game, so I had to bring him off otherwise the game would've been over too quick,"" recalls Newsham with a chuckle. ""I'd keep bringing him off and he'd just stick by the side of my leg, looking up at me asking, 'Can I go on again yet, Paul?' He was so happy to be playing.""From the first training session, his control of the ball at that sort of age was excellent. You could tell watching him he was a totally different level to everyone else.""Greenwood (2R) celebrates scoring his team's second goal  against Aston Villa on July 9, 2020. Greenwood's scoring ability is a natural talent honed to such an extent that Solskjaer, a man who worked with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, has described him as the deadliest finisher he has seen at such an age. He is only the fourth teenager in United's history, following George Best, Brian Kidd and Rooney, to score 17 goals or more in a season. It was at Idle's annual invitational tournament, involving youth teams in the local area, that Greenwood was set on a path that would lead to Old Trafford. Having impressed onlooking scouts, including United's, shortly after the tournament he started training at United's development centre in Halifax, Yorkshire, eventually signing for the club aged nine. ""I did speak to some scouts at that tournament, I'm sure I spoke to a Man Utd scout but I don't recollect it because there were that many coming up to me then asking about him,"" adds Newsham.""Once he went to Manchester United when he was seven, he couldn't play for us. His dad rung me to say he wasn't allowed to play anymore. I was gutted, but when you go to train with a club like that you can understand why they don't want to play local football.""Flourishing under SolskjaerGreenwood's rise has been rapid, but of no surprise to his former coach. Aged 14, United gave him a scholarship. Two years later, he was topping the scoring charts in the Under-18s Premier League (north) and being named player of the tournament at the 2018 International Cor Groenewegen Tournament. He also excelled at age group level for England, helping England's Under-18s win the four-team Limoges tournament. Greenwood in action during the international friendly between England U15 and Turkey U15 at St George's Park on December 21, 2015 in Burton-upon-Trent, England.It was under Jose Mourinho that Greenwood made his senior debut for United, against Club America in Phoenix on a pre-season tour in the summer of 2018, but it is under Solskjaer that he has blossomed, particularly excelling once the EPL resumed in June following a 100-day pause because of the coronavirus pandemic. He is now established in the first team, scoring five times in the last eight games of the season, and returned from lockdown with a noticeably more muscular frame than the teenager who started the season on the substitutes' bench. ""That's sometimes something you see with young players, that initially you see them and there's evidence of talent, but then there's a point where they develop that extra, whether it's upper body muscle or that edge of pace, to take them away from someone,"" British sports journalist Richard Jolly tells CNN Sport. ""I guess we'll never know what would have happened without the lockdown, but he does seem to have come back from it stronger and looking ready to play every week.""What sets Greenwood apart from most other players is that he is two-footed, a rare skill acquired thanks to his father who would encourage him to practice with both feet. Twenty minutes before the start of training at United's Halifax center, Greenwood would be shooting with both feet at the bins outside the door, so the story goes. His family, who have shied away from media attention, as has the teenager himself, have been key to his rise, with his father taking him to Moss Side, a relatively deprived area of the city, to play five-a-side football to toughen him up.Greenwood celebrates scoring against Bournemouth at Old Trafford on July 4, 2020.Poised in front of goal, he plays as if time slows when he has the ball and has already proven he can score from all sorts of angles and distances. ""He's genuinely two-footed with his finishing, he scores a good number of goals from outside the box as well as inside,"" adds Jolly. ""For those who believe in expected goals, Greenwood over-performs his expected goals to a huge extent, showing what a good finisher he is. He's not missing chances at all.""Everyone at United probably knows he's here to stay. He is one for the long term and he's much like [Marcus] Rashford, he's one of those who saved them 50 or 100 million pounds.""'Massively exciting'There needs to be some perspective, of course. At the same age, World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe was starring in the Champions League and breaking Thierry's Henry Ligue 1 scoring record. Yet, there is no denying that Greenwood is a wondrous talent. Football is a brutal business and Greenwood has already beaten the odds by making it this far -- according to Michael Calvin in his book ""No Hunger in Paradise"" only 180 of the 1.5 million boys who play organized youth football in England will become a Premier League professional. But throughout his young life, Greenwood has set himself apart from the rest. Kylian Mbappe: The 'phenomenon that breathes and sleeps football'""With Mason Greenwood, we're actually looking at a player that can be anything he wants to be,"" Mark Goldbridge, presenter for United Stand, tells CNN Sport. ""People are talking about him being up there with the likes of Neymar, Mbappe and Messi. I think that's unfair. But at 18 years of age, I remember Wayne Rooney and there are parallels in different ways, in that he's got a talent that senior, experienced Premier League clubs are struggling to shut him down when he's in full flow off both feet.""We're really, really excited about what he's going to become at Manchester United.""The praise directed at Greenwood these last few weeks has been lavish. Should he continue on an upward trajectory, he may have to become accustomed to it. Additional reporting by CNN's Ben Church "
football,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/football/manchester-united-bruno-fernandes-europa-league-cmd-spt-intl/index.html,How Bruno Fernandes transformed Manchester United's fortunes,"By Ben Church, CNN"," (CNN)There hasn't been much to shout about at Manchester United over the last few years. The success enjoyed under legendary manager Alex Ferguson feels like a distant memory for a global fan base that has watched its once great club lurch from one bad decision to another. An FA Cup win in 2016 under Louis van Gaal and Europa League glory under Jose Mourinho in 2017 were two of the highlights in what's been an uninspiring period since Ferguson retired in 2013 -- and a far cry from the 38 trophies won by Scot in his 26 years at the club. The future didn't look much brighter back in January. The club, now managed by former player Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, found itself fifth in the league table by New Year.The football was poor, the atmosphere was toxic and star man Paul Pogba, once seen as the saving grace, looked set to leave as soon as he could. Read MoreWhat I learned from watching 92 games of Premier League football in a rowBut, fast forward seven months, and there are now signs of new life under Solskjaer, most notably since the arrival of one Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese playmaker turned up at Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon in January and was thrown into a team lacking creativity, quality and leadership. Fortunately for his new employees, it seems Fernandes has all three of those attributes in abundance.  Since his debut at the start of the year, United had not lost a game in the league, rising up the table to finish third and qualify for next season's UEFA Champion League for the first time since the 2018-19 season. It was a remarkable feat considering the club started the campaign by making its worst start to a league season in 33 years. What's more, Fernandes brought excitement back to the red half of Manchester after years of uninspiring, and often woeful, performances. His eight league goals and seven assists demonstrate the sort of player United now has on its hands. ""He [Fernandes] told me about the league, how intense it is to play in that league,"" Porto star Danilo Pereira told CNN Sport. ""It's not a surprise for me to see the impact he's had in Manchester. I think United can return to their golden years with him and Pogba and other players.""READ: Rashford to be awarded honorary doctorate for forcing government U-turnBruno Fernandes had an instant impact on Manchester United. 'A really, really good signing'If such a thing as a typical Manchester United player exists, Fernandes would surely be it. A risk-taker, exciting to watch and able to cope with the extreme pressures of playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world, the attacking midfielder has become an instant hit.He's been a leader from day one; stepping up to take (and score) six penalties during his short spell at the club -- including the pivotal spot-kick against Leicester City which helped United on its way to Champions League football next season. Ex-players and pundits alike have fawned over his performances since he moved to England, where he's won the Man of the Match award in almost every game he's played. ""You can see that he's got the talent and he's not scared. He wants the ball, which I would expect from a very good player,"" former Premier League star and current Monaco player Cesc Fabregas told CNN Sport. ""But what I like is that he's intelligent in terms of moving around the pitch. He knows when to get between the lines. He knows when to go in the space when he sees that someone is available to make a chip. He arrives at the second line fantastically. ""He supports the midfield when they are building up and struggle a little bit, and when teams are putting a lot of pressure on them. ""He can play long, he can play short, little passes. He has the personality to take free-kicks and penalties. He's not scared. He doesn't hide. I think Man United made a really good choice. A really good signing.""READ: Meet the Manchester United fanatic opening a 33,000-piece museum in FinlandThe playmaker helped fire the club into next season's UEFA Champions League. Instant impactAdapting to the Premier League is no simple feat. It usually takes players time to get used to the physicality and fast paced nature of the league, but it hasn't been a stumbling block for Fernandes.Although his performances in Portugal gave an indication of what was to come, such an instant impact took many by surprise. ""You looked at the player at Sporting Lisbon and clearly he was someone who scored a lot of goals and someone who created a lot of goals, but there's always a challenge as to whether they can translate that to a better league and into a new club,"" British journalist Richard Jolly told CNN Sport, adding that he saw no realistic way of United finishing in the top four without Fernandes.  ""But he's been a transformative player and a revelation in terms of how quickly he's done it, I mean it really was from day one.""You look at both the goal tallies and the assist tallies, and they're fantastic. If you could maintain that form over the entire season, that's an incredible player there."" JUST WATCHEDBlack footballers too 'scared' to look at social media due to racist abuse, says ZahaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBlack footballers too 'scared' to look at social media due to racist abuse, says Zaha 03:33Pogba improvement Whilst his individual brilliance is evident, Fernandes' arrival has seen the uptick in the form of players around him. The attacking trio of Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford scored at will after football returned from lockdown (the team has scored 22 goals in its last nine league games), and the likes of Pogba and Nemanja Matic have looked more settled in the midfield. Pogba, in particular, is a different player to one who was seemingly weighed down by the pressure of being the biggest star in the starting lineup.The Frenchman's relationship with the club appeared to reach rock bottom earlier this season, with constant rumors linking the midfielder with a move away from the club. Fans also grew frustrated with Pogba for spending much of the season on the treatment table after suffering two ankle injuries. When they did catch a glimpse of him on the field, he often underwhelmed.  But now, since he returned from his latest injury after lockdown, there have been early signs that a partnership with Fernandes could flourish and the World Cup winner suddenly looks more comfortable. ""I think Pogba likes to be surrounded by big players and big characters in their own right, I don't think he wants to be the only big name there, and thus have all the pressure lumped on him,"" Jolly said.""I think he probably doesn't want to be in a midfield where he's surrounded by mediocrities. I think you've seen signs already of a bit of chemistry between Pogba and Fernandes which helps, but I think he also just appreciates the element that he's playing with other quality players around him."" Paul Pogba has vastly improved since Fernandes joined. The new Cantona? Fernandes had been linked to a move to Old Trafford throughout 2019 and there had been disappointment when the deal wasn't completed in time for the new season. So, when the transfer got over the line in January for an initial $61 million (£47m), fans were ready to see what all the fuss was about. It's safe to say they haven't been disappointed. Mark Goldbridge, a United supporter and presenter of fan channel The United Stand, cannot wait to see how the team develops. ""I sort of liken it to what Eric Cantona did when he came to Manchester United from Leeds [in 1992] and we won our first Premier League title,"" he said. ""It was sort of the kick-start for some real success.""Now, I'm not saying Bruno Fernandes is going to lead Manchester United to the same level of success that Cantona did but he's not just one player coming in and making us great. ""It's one player that's come in and made everybody else around him better."" It's easy to forget that Fernandes has only been at the club for a matter of months but he's already established himself as a firm fan favorite -- with one particular moment, in a game against local rivals Manchester City, a defining one of his short time at the club. Fernandes got involved with a sideline feud with Pep Guardiola, resulting in the Portuguese player putting his finger to his lips and shushing the City manager. ""I think Bruno, in a very short period of time, has certainly come in and really grasped what Manchester United is all about,"" said Goldbridge.""Ultimately, there's a thin line between grasping what Manchester United is all about and actually just being somebody who loves the game, wants to play the game in the right way, and is passionate to win.""I remember his little argument with Pep when we played Man City, and the fans loved that because I think Fernandes just wants to win."" READ: Rashford, the gifted Manchester United star who became a remarkable activistFernandes has provided United's front three with more chances. Another false dawn?Whilst United's form dropped for the final two games of the season, fans will be holding on to those encouraging signs of life and hoping this isn't yet another false dawn at the club. The third-place finish, although not befitting of the club's true ambition, must be seen as progress and attention can now turn to winning the Europa League, which is set to resume on August 5.  United face a simple task in their second-leg tie against LASK on Wednesday, leading 5-0 from the first leg and all but guaranteed a place in the quarterfinals. Although winning European football's secondary club cup competition is nothing to be smirked at, the real prize is still the Premier League. Despite all the improvements seen at the club in recent weeks, the gulf between it and the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City remains wide -- it finished 33 points behind eventual champion Liverpool this season. A productive summer in the transfer market could be just what United needs, and Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho is just one of the names being linked with a switch to Old Trafford.There had been signs of success during both Van Gaal and Mourinho's time at the club but something does feel different about United under Solskjaer.Maybe a return to its glory days aren't too far away. ""It does look more sustainable and one of the things that they're doing is they're not just beating teams but, if you look at that winning run, they've won quite a lot of those games comfortably and quite emphatically, and, quite entertainingly,"" said Jolly. ""I think what you might see next year is not necessarily United winning the league but them getting in the top four a lot more comfortably."""

Inspired by the spelbinding performances of Pelé -- he wore the number 10 jersey  -- the yellow shirt has represented Brazil's success on the pitch and created a positive image worldwide for the past five decades.That 1970 national team also became embroiled in politics, notably ahead of the World Cup in Mexico when General Medici, the president of a nation under military dictatorship, played a key role in the removal of the coach -- Joao Saldanha -- who had overseen a perfect qualification campaign.Fast forward to 2020 and critics of Bolsonaro say the iconic yellow jersey has now become tainted by its close association to the Brazilian president.  President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro celebrates with the trophy and the players of Brazil after winning the Copa America final against Peru.Walter Casagrande, a former footballer for the Brazilian national team and the São Paulo club Corinthians, remembers the feeling of scoring a goal while wearing the yellow jersey in his first match with the ""selecao"" in 1985.Read More""It was a magical thing,"" Casagrande told CNN Sport, ""like an enchanted object that gave me huge emotion.""  Casagrande's sentiments lie on the left side of the political chasm separating Bolsonaro's supporters and opponents, and he feels an item he cherishes is being misrepresented.""Now I consider the Brazilian yellow jersey to have been kidnapped and appropriated by the right wing, so we cannot use it."" Casagrande said that for him the power of the yellow shirt used to be that it represented democracy and freedom.""Brazil is appearing horribly to the world right now,"" he said. ""It's the first time in my life I'm seeing the yellow jersey being used against democracy and freedom.""

As a Bolsonaro supporter, Alexandre brushes off accusations that the jersey's symbolism is being manipulated, and says the reason for supporters to wear a yellow t-shirt is simple: everyone in Brazil has a yellow t-shirt.He points out that supporters don't always wear the Brazilian team jersey specifically, and rallies are full of people wearing yellow t-shirts of all kinds.

Manchester City dominated possession without creating too many clear-cut chances while Pep Guardiola's team looked susceptible on the break.After the half-time break, the game opened up and following an attacking substitution by Guardiola, City began to create chances at will. And eventually the pressure told, as some nice footwork by England international Raheem Sterling freed him up to lay it back for de Bruyne to finish. It looked like there would only be one winner. However, Lyon's own super-sub Dembélé thought differently, latching on to a through ball near half-way and finishing under Ederson.

Just 59 seconds later, Lyon had scored again, Dembélé pouncing on a poor save from Ederson to send the French club into the final four for the first time in nearly 10 years.

Get news about destinations opening and closing, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.(CNN) — Asked to choose an icon of beauty, most people might think of a landscape, a city skyline or a work of art. Laird Kay, on the other hand, would say an airplane. The avgeek -- who fell in love with planes as a child on vacation -- has always seen aircraft as objects of beauty, as well as of convenience. And in his job as an airplane photographer, he allows the rest of us to see things through his eyes. In Kay's photos, airplanes become birds mid-flight, frozen in time on the runway and shot from above. Their wings soar, their noses look like curious beaks. His photos make even details like rivets, insulation and exhaust pipes look beautiful. Planes are, he says, ""beautiful objects of sculpture.""Kay's story is a fascinating one of a man who turned his hobby into a profession. Perhaps the most astonishing thing is that, although he's now employed by the likes of Lufthansa, Air Canada and Virgin Atlantic, until a few years ago he was working in a completely different job, and planes were his hobby.A secret avgeek pastKay's work has involved going to an Air France production line to see A220s being built.Laird Kay""I've always been an airplane geek and I've always loved photography,"" says Kay, who fell in love with aviation on his first flight on a 747 as a child, ""in the days when they allowed you into the cockpit.""But, as he says, ""regular life happened."" He became a designer, training for his profession and ending up spending a decade designing wine cellars. But he never forgot his first love, photography -- and after 12 years in the design business, he decided to try to pivot. Interiors or architectural photography was the obvious choice, and his plan. He started freelancing as a photographer -- mainly interiors and product shots. But as Kay took his photography further, he found himself hanging out at airports for the first time in his life, combining his photography skills with his other early love -- airplanes.""I'd always been a passive lover of planes,"" he says. ""I'd been incredibly happy getting on, and would arrive way before takeoff. I loved the airport experience -- everything about the travel experience was magical to me.""Related contentThe man recreating airplane meals to get through lockdownBut now, he moved from passive to active, going spotting for the first time. ""There are some fun places in Toronto where you can get close to where the plane lands -- you're directly under it on its final approach,"" he says.Kay's pictures of planes landing at his native Toronto, posted on Tumblr, had a very specific aesthetic. He was using his background as a designer to home in on mechanical details, shooting them in ways that those of us without an analytical eye would never notice.He focuses on details and presents them as sculpture.Laird Kay""I was doing very tight crops, focusing on details people don't get to see -- under the wings, the rivets -- not your typical planespotting pictures,"" he says. ""Everyone has what they want to photograph. Some people want to get every Air Canada plane registration number so they have a catalogue. Some are taking pictures because they know their loved ones are on the plane. I was fascinated by the beauty of the machines.In 2015, after 18 months running his Tumblr, he got an email from Lufthansa, asking if he'd work with them. They wanted him to shoot the delivery flight of their Boeing 747 with retro livery, traveling from Seattle to Frankfurt.Not only was it his favorite plane, and not only did Kay get an insider's look at the aircraft -- ""the economy cabin hadn't had the seats installed so it was a totally empty space, planes are huge without seats,"" he says -- but it was the catalyst for a new career.""I started doing more and more aviation photography,"" he says. ""More airlines would find me on social media and want to work with me, and I started pitching others, too."" His idea: ""to showcase the beauty of the plane"" as well as the brand.  Over the past eight years, Kay has transitioned into a seasoned aircraft photographer, which now forms the bulk of his business -- propped up by industrial, travel, architecture and interiors shots. A maintenance worker polishing a private jet.Laird KayHe's photographed everything from private jets to airplane factories. He's leaned out of an open helicopter window to shoot LAX airport in Los Angeles, photographed the production line for Air France's A220s, and shot a campaign for Virgin Atlantic.He's worked for airports from Santiago de Chile to Paris Charles de Gaulle, and has covered airline food, liveries and assembly lines.And although he's moved on from Tumblr -- he prefers Instagram nowadays -- Kay's aesthetic hasn't changed.""What I love is photographing the details people don't take time to notice,"" he says.""We're all familiar with the flying experience, but there's still magic and beauty in it.""I like finding the curves and textures of the window casing; the pattern of the seatbelt buckle against the seat. Think of all the people in the design process -- every touchpoint is incredibly considered. I just want to showcase it -- 'I see what you've done, and love it.'""In fact, Kay calls what he does ""product photography on a huge scale.""""You're photographing the largeness of the plane, but focusing on the tiny details of the seat, cloth, stitching and whatnot,"" he says.He often gets to shoot crew and airports, too -- as well as behind-the-scenes processes like loading and unloading.  The $570 million questionChanging a lens above a million-dollar plane has its stresses.Laird KayHowever much love you have for the industry, being an aviation photographer has its downsides.Sometimes it rains when Kay has been flown in for a shoot -- ""you go with it,"" he says. And for someone who isn't great with heights, as he isn't, it can be tricky. Take the shoot he did for Lufthansa, photographing planes in their new livery from above. For that one, he was put on a cherry picker and raised 10 feet above the planes, parked on the tarmac.""I was looking down on an A380 changing a lens, thinking, 'If I drop this lens, that's €500 million ($570 million) of damage that's gonna happen. That was fantastic and I love the shots that I got, but I've got sweaty hands just thinking about it."" It ended up being his favorite shoot. Related contentHow aviation geeks have coped with lockdownWorking on shoots has also been a masterclass in logistics. ""It's made me incredibly appreciative of how complex airplanes, airlines and airports are,"" he says. ""It's a ballet orchestrated to get these planes back and forth, on time, and loaded. Even the logistics of trying to organize a plane [for the shoot] is incredibly difficult. They want aircraft to earn money -- having one sit idle for a whole day isn't easy. Every time I do a shoot, I learn something new. Planes with the skin offShooting production lines gives him a different view of aircraft design.Laird KayDuring the pandemic, things slowed down as they did for everyone in aviation. As he waited for the industry to pick up again, Kay redid his website, learned more about video, and designed an ""aviation-inspired wallpaper and products"" that he hopes will soon be available. He also listened to airport sounds to remind him of the good times.By now, things are back to normal. In the last few weeks alone, he's done a shoot in Los Angeles, and flown Air France for the first time on a job for them in Paris. Part of that was photographing their new A220s in situ. He'd shot the same planes in the summer, on the assembly line in Quebec.""It was fascinating -- like a giant laboratory, so clean, clinical and exact,"" he says, saying that the highlights were ""seeing the workers putting them together by hand"" and ""the wonder of all the work that goes into the planes.""""Seeing how beautiful they are even with the skin off -- the insulation, the wiring -- it amazes me that people can build something so incredibly beautiful,"" he adds.Airlines tend to fly him over for the jobs -- ""Great for understanding the passenger experience on the plane I'll be shooting"" -- and then give him a day in the destination to acclimatize before doing a sunrise-to-sunset shoot. ""It's tiring but fun -- people who work for airlines are plane geeks so they're loving it as well,"" he says. Little wonder that fellow enthusiasts often offer their assistance. In fact, he met his assistant for a Lufthansa shoot in 2019, Christian Engels, through avgeek circles. The sky's the limitKay advises photographers to find their own aesthetic.Laird KayWhere does an aircraft photographer go next? The sky's the limit, in Kay's case. He wants to photograph planes in motion, he says -- shooting from one plane, as another flies ""next to you"" (although technically it's some distance away, of course).And while he's shot from a open-doored helicopter over airports and container ships before, he'd love to do that over planes, too. ""It's terrifying, and I do have to psych myself up as someone who doesn't like heights, but once you're there you're concentrating on getting the shots,"" he says.For those who want to follow in his footsteps, the best thing to do is to get out onto the runway, he says.""Start taking pictures, and find your unique voice in your photos,"" he advises. ""It was honestly just a hobby for me -- I had no idea you could turn this into a career, and I'm incredibly lucky that I did. ""I'm still fascinated with the magic of flight. I'm fascinated how we've created this beautiful machine to take us round the world, how many people have been involved in the design process, from the location of the rivets to the curve of the window, and fascinated how that has evolved over time. ""I just love making planes look sexy."""

It has recorded about 39,000 deaths overall.It imposed among the world's strictest border controls two years ago as the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe.It saw some initial success in keeping the virus out, but the policy dealt a blow to its burgeoning tourism sector, which accounted for about 10% of gross domestic product in 2019.Foreign arrivals fell to 157,000 last year, compared with 18 million in 2019.

First step: advertise it to Chinese domestic travelers.

The Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake in Utah are both chloride lakes. Yuncheng, however, falls into the last group.""If the sulfate in your water is greater than the calcium, all the calcium is used up, which leaves you with an excess of sulfate and you have a sulfate lake,"" explains Hong Kong Baptist University geography professor Bernie Owen.Xiechi is also a ""closed basin"" lake -- meaning it doesn't flow out to a river or ocean -- which explains how its salt content stays so high.""Water comes in with salt, water escapes, salt stays behind, more water comes in with salt, evaporation. Salt stays behind,"" Owen explains. ""There's no outlet on this one. It will just gradually become saltier and saltier and saltier.""But what about those gorgeous colors that have made the lake so popular with photographers? They have to do with the species of animals and plants living in the water.""if you've got brine shrimps, you tend to get red colors,"" says Owen. ""There's a microscopic animal called a rotifer, and that will give a purple color. Purples you (also) tend to get with green algae. And then greens or oranges (occur) in very saline lakes.""It is possible for salt lakes to freeze over, although not as quickly as other lakes -- after all, think about what happens when we spread salt over icy roads. Saltwater freezes at lower temperatures than freshwater.An aerial view of Xiechi LakeXue Jun/AlamyA lake becomes a starIn an effort to boost Xiechi Lake's international profile, China is reportedly taking steps to get it listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. In a 2019 WeChat post, Luo Huining, party secretary of Shanxi Province, announced that local officials had begun the application process.""Yuncheng Salt Lake is the crystallization of Chinese culture and civilization. The salt lake has positive significance for promoting our cultural confidence and heritage,"" he said at the time.China has heavily focused on UNESCO bids, which can be expensive and time-consuming, as a way to confer international legitimacy on its many historical and natural wonders.Currently, China has 56 such World Heritage sites, placing it second only to Italy on the total list. That feat is even more impressive considering that the country's first crop of UNESCO designations -- which included the Great Wall and Forbidden City -- only came in 1987. Two more such recognitions would tie China with Italy for the top spot on the UNESCO list.Related contentWhere China's wealthy travelers are going during the pandemicThere's some good news for wannabe travelers who hope to visit Xiechi Lake -- it isn't yet as popular or crowded as other tourist spots in China.Tiger Li of travel company Diverse China tells CNN that he has only organized a few visits there. Nearly all the visitors so far have been Chinese domestic travelers.That is likely to remain unchanged as long as China remains mostly closed to international tourism. The country closed its borders in early 2020 and remains one of the few destinations in the world still adhering to a ""zero Covid"" strategy that includes very strict quarantine policies.""Besides the scenery, I think the mud bath and other experiences are the key reason they go (to Xiechi Lake),"" Li says.

It was found in Norway 462 days later,"By Sara Smart, CNN"," (CNN)A miniboat built by fifth graders took to the seas on October 25, 2020, charging off into the Gulf Stream for its maiden voyage. That voyage would take 5.5-foot-long Rye Riptides over 8,000 miles from home -- all the way to the coast of Norway after 462 days at sea.It began at Rye Junior High School, located about 50 miles east of Concord, through a not-for-profit program to spread ocean and environmental literacy called Educational Passage.A tiny boat was discovered on a remote beach 27 years after it was launched by teachersThe miniboat program sends kits to students to help them learn things like science, technology, engineering, art, and math skills as well as building connections, Educational Passage's executive director, Cassie Stymiest, told CNN on Tuesday.Students build the GPS-tracked boat, fill it with items, decorate it and send it on its way. ""It's like a 21st century message in a bottle,"" Stymiest said.The boat, named Rye Riptides, traveled more than 8,000 miles and landed in Norway 462 days after it was launched in 2020.The boat kit was originally purchased in 2018 by a now-retired teacher and each of her fifth-grade classes worked together to build it since then, according to Stymiest.Read MoreWhen the pandemic prevented this year's class from finishing the decorating process, Stymiest volunteered to help out. Students sent their decorations to her and she put the finishing touches on the vessel, which they named Rye Riptides. On launch day, the students watched Riptides set off on Facebook Live.A 50-year pen pal friendship that began with a message in a bottleIn the months after the October launch, classes watched Riptides make its way up and across the Atlantic Ocean through data from the GPS tracker. Its last pinged location was on September 30, 2021, and Stymiest said they thought they had lost the boat when they didn't see another notification for months.But, on January 31, she noticed the location had changed. Riptides had landed on the coast of Smøla, Norway.She immediately took to social media to reach out to the local community about retrieving the vessel. Then, on February 1, Mariann Nuncic responded that the boat was on an island near her house.Karel Nuncic, left, took the vessel to his 6th grade class to open it with his classmates.That afternoon, when her son, Karel, got home from school, the Nuncic's got in their boat and searched the coast to find what was left of the miniboat. And find it they did -- Riptides was covered in Gooseneck barnacles, had lost its mast, and its hull and keel were no longer attached, but its precious cargo was still safe.Karel, who also happens to be in the sixth grade, took the boat to his own class.  They opened it to reveal the items inside, which including leaves, US quarters, and even a face mask with the students' names on it.The Rye Junior High students, who were now in sixth and seventh grade, were excited to hear about the recovery, Stymiest said. The two classes are eager to meet each other and will do so on Thursday through Zoom, Stymiest said.Going from New Hampshire to Smøla may seem like a lengthy journey for such a small boat, but Stymiest said it isn't their longest. That award goes to a vessel sent from Massachusetts that landed in Australia.Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the ocean where the boat sailed. It was the Atlantic."
travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-valentines-day-himalayas/index.html,They met on Valentine's Day while hiking in the Himalayas,,"(CNN) — It was Valentine's Day 1996 when Lee Green walked into a mountain lodge in Nepal, surrounded by the snowcapped Himalayas, and encountered Mandy Halse for the first time.Green and Halse were thousands of miles from their respective homes in England and New Zealand. Both were backpackers in their twenties determined to see as much of the world as they could. They'd found themselves in Nepal by a series of coincidences. When Green entered the Nepalese teahouse, the stage was set for a memorable meet-cute.Except on February 14, there were no sparks between the two travelers.Two weeks later it was a different story, one that's still ongoing 26 years later.A meeting in GhorepaniHere's Mandy Halse in Nepal on the morning of  February 14, 1996.Kirsty BloomFor Halse, Nepal was a spontaneous layover en route from Auckland to the UK, where she was set to visit an old friend. She'd been exploring Thailand and Malaysia, and a travel agent had recommended breaking up the journey with a stint in Nepal. After learning of Nepal's trekking routes, she met a British woman, Kirsty, while in line for a permit to hike the Annapurna Circuit. The two decided to join forces to tackle the trail, which winds through Nepal's central mountains, taking in picturesque villages and incredible views along the way.Halse, who'd had no idea what to expect, was awestruck by the spectacular landscape, particularly when she and fellow hikers arrived in the village of Ghorepani, where they set up camp in a ""teahouse"" mountain lodge.""It was the most beautiful setting,"" Halse tells CNN Travel today.She was sitting in the lodge's common area with her new friend Kirsty and other backpackers when Lee Green walked in.Green, a mailman from the English town of Coventry, was traveling Nepal on a career break with colleague and good friend Murray. The two men had originally intended to use their sabbatical to embark on a cycle ride from the UK to India, but had abandoned the plan after just 200 miles, realizing navigating northern Europe in winter on bike was going to take too long.Instead, they'd ended up flying to India, trekking through the northern part of the country, before making their way to Nepal.The two friends arrived at the city of Pokhara, and set off on the Annapurna trek. Like Halse, they'd befriended other travelers en route.Green (second from left) and Halse (third from right) embarked on Nepal's Annapurna circuit with a group of other backpackers they'd met along the way. Kirsty Bloom""There's one path that links village to village to village, so most people that go trekking tend to overlap each other, meet up with each other at the tea houses, along the path,"" Green tells CNN Travel today.When Green's group entered the teahouse, they were warmly greeted by Halse and the other travelers. The backpackers ended up chatting through the night, playing cards by candlelight.""It was really nice, it was really chilled,"" says Halse. ""The teahouse was gorgeous.""The travelers spent a couple of days there, before continuing as a group onto the next leg of the trek.Halse and Green were friendly to one another on their first few days hiking, but they didn't have much opportunity to chat one on one.""We didn't talk much in the beginning as we were both very quiet, and we walked in different parts of the group: me in the middle with Murray, and Lee at the back with Kirsty,"" says Halse.Related contentTwo strangers meet on an airplane. Four years later they fall in loveA growing connectionThe backpackers were trekking through spectacular landscapes. Here's the group near Muktinath Valley in February 1996.Kirsty BloomWhen the travelers reached the Annapurna circuit's 5,400-meter-high Thorung La mountain pass, they found their way blocked by heavy snow, forcing them to turn back.Some of the group decided to give up at that point, making their way back, via plane, to the trail's gateway town of Pokhara. Halse and Green, along with their friends Murray and Kirsty, decided to make the full return trek by foot, just the four of them.So began another two weeks of walking -- and it was in this period that Halse and Green started to grow closer.""We'd become quite good friends, and as we're walking along I started feeling the vibe, the tingles,"" says Halse.When the group arrived in Tatopani, just up the trail from their original meeting place in Ghorepani, the town's balmier climate and beautiful hot springs were a welcome change to the snows they'd just emerged from.""There's oranges and lemons growing everywhere, citrus fruits growing, it's like a little Garden of Eden. It's a great place to relax and chill after the hard trekking,"" says Green.Halse and Green grew closer as the trek continued.Kirsty BloomLounging at the hot springs over the next few days, Green and Halse grew closer still. They recall braiding one another's long hair and talking about previous adventures, their lives back home and travel goals.""We soon realized we were very similar,"" says Halse. ""We both wanted to travel, we were prepared to work hard and save money, and to achieve our travel goals, which is what we both wanted to do,"" adds Green. ""We realized it would be quite nice to do it together.""They shared their first kiss on February 29, 1996, a leap year. From that day onwards, they were inseparable. But while they were swept up in their new romance, the two remained keenly aware that travel flings don't always last, so Green and Halse focused on enjoying the moment. They decided, along with Kirsty and Murray, to extend their time in Nepal and embark on a trek to Everest.The only issue was Halse had somehow lost her passport. Before continuing any further, she had to head to Kathmandu to get new papers.So the pair said goodbye to one another, hoping it would just be a short separation, as Green and Murray went on ahead.A couple of days in, it looked like Halse's passport would be arriving sooner rather than later. With no internet or cellphones to convey the news, Halse scribbled a hand-written note updating Green, letting him know she'd be hot on his heels before long. Note in hand, Halse hopped onto the bus that was heading to the Everest trail, and asked if anyone heading that way would look out for the two men and pass on the message. She included a description of Green and Murray on the back of the note. Here's one of the notes Halse passed along the trail for Green.Lee & Mandy/Frugal TravellersShe did the same thing the following day, and the day after that -- and then before long, Halse had her new passport and she and Kirsty were en route to Namche Bazaar, the gateway to Everest, hoping to catch up with the two mailmen.The notes successfully made their way up the trail to Green and Murray.""As we got closer and closer to Namche Bazaar, all of a sudden people started walking up to us on the trail with these notes, and they were like, ""Oh we've got a note for you guys,"" -- you know, in the middle of the mountains in Nepal,"" recalls Green. ""We open the note and it's from Mandy.""The two men couldn't believe it.""More and more people started giving us these notes,"" says Green. ""So we wrote some notes back.""They passed these replies to trekkers walking the opposite way, describing Halse and Kirsty, and hoping the notes would make it to the two women successfully.Here's Halse and Green on the trek to Everest Base Camp.Lee & Mandy/Frugal TravellersMeanwhile, Halse and Kirsty were walking as fast as they could to catch up -- so much so, they ended up overtaking Green and Murray. Eventually, the group were reunited in the small village of Jorsale, between the entrance to the Sagarmatha National Park and Namche Bazaar.From there, they headed to the 5,357-meter Gokyo Ri peak, because Kirsty had read that the view of Everest was more impressive and that the trail didn't have as many trekkers. It turned out to be a highlight of the trip.""We were walking on a frozen lake, which if I'd thought about it, I think I would have been scared, but the snow was up to our thighs,"" says Green.Related contentThe couple who fell in love in AntarcticaSix weeks in IndiaHalse and Green went on together from Nepal to India, here they are at the Taj Mahal.Lee & Mandy/Frugal TravellersBy the time they returned to Kathmandu at the end of April, Halse and Green were certain their connection was more than a fleeting holiday romance.""We realized that we wanted to be together,"" says Green.After Murray decided to fly back home to the UK and Kirsty went off on her next adventure, Green and Halse were suddenly alone for the first time. They both had six weeks before they were due to fly on to the UK -- Halse to visit her friend on a pre-arranged trip, and Green to return to work -- so the two decided to fill the time with a trip around India.They traveled largely by rail, whiling away the long journeys staring out the window and chatting to one another and fellow travelers. They reunited with Kirsty in the southern India state of Kerala, and again at Agra to visit the Taj Mahal. The trio traveled together to New Delhi, before Kirsty parted ways again.It was an amazing six weeks for Halse and Green, but they also navigated some trickier moments together -- such as when, towards the end of their trip, they fell ill. But they supported one another through these ups and downs, and ended the journey stronger than they'd started.""You can tell whether you're compatible with someone if you have to go through tough times together, and we went through some challenging traveling experiences in India, and we came out of it really well,"" says Green.By coincidence, the friend Halse was set to visit in the UK lived in Birmingham, which was only 30 minutes away from where Green was based in Coventry.""This was the amazing thing -- two people from the other side of the world met halfway, and were going in the same direction and heading to the same place,"" says Green.When Green got home, he dumped his backpack, went to see his parents and told them he'd be heading to Birmingham the following day to see Halse.""I met this Kiwi girl. I quite like her and she's just down the road,"" he recalls saying.Green had sent his family postcards from his travels, but hadn't mentioned that he'd met a girl. Halse, meanwhile, had written long letters home to her sister describing her chance meeting with Green.""I told my sister everything,"" Halse recalls.Her sister still has the 11-page letter Halse wrote her from Nepal, describing in detail how she felt about Green.

They also visited cities including York, Oxford, Blackpool and London.Then Halse had to return down under -- her brother was getting married in Australia, and her grandparents were celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary in New Zealand. Halse arranged to meet up with Green again in New Zealand in six months time. Green had negotiated another sabbatical with his employers, so the couple planned a second stint traveling together. Meantime, they navigated a long distance relationship.""I think we racked up $1,000 worth of phone calls,"" says Halse of this period. ""We wrote to each other, we wrote aerograms.""Back in Auckland, Halse busied herself working. She missed Green, but she worried that he was finding the separation even harder going.""Lee was pining, he was working crazy hours at the Post Office,"" says Halse.

travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/ghost-flights-pandemic-greenpeace-cmd/index.html,Why the sky is still full of empty 'ghost' flights,,"(CNN) — In the early days of the pandemic, when demand for air travel abruptly flatlined and international borders closed, ""ghost flights"" became a common phenomenon. These were empty or near-empty planes traversing the skyline as airline schedules kept to their contractual obligations to fly. The problem is that, nearly two years on, they're still haunting the skies above us. In fact, more than 100,000 ""ghost flights"" will sail over European skies this winter, according to recent analysis from Greenpeace. The climate damage, claims the environmental group, is ""equivalent to the yearly emissions of more than 1.4 million cars.""The Greenpeace figures are extrapolated from a December interview with Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr in which he warned that Lufthansa Group was facing the prospect of 18,000 superfluous flights over the six-month winter season to retain its slots under European rules. On the basis that Lufthansa's air traffic accounts for 17% of the European market, Greenpeace reckons the total number of Europe's ghost flights would generate 2.1 million tonnes of CO2. The analysis has triggered a torrent of outrage. Campaigner Greta Thunberg asserted that ""Brussels Airlines [part of the Lufthansa group] makes 3,000 unnecessary flights to maintain airport slots."" In the UK, a petition was launched, appealing to the government to ground unoccupied flights. Lufthansa, meanwhile, says it's doing its best to fill all its aircraft, but was struggling to balance Covid chaos with the need to hold onto its slots.""Unnecessary flights are not empty or 'ghost' flights,"" a spokesman for the airline told CNN. ""They are scheduled flights that are poorly booked due to the pandemic. Despite poor demand, Lufthansa Group Airlines must operate these flights to continue securing takeoff and landing rights at hubs and major EU airports.""Lufthansa says that the emergence of the Omicron variant is the reason its projections for the season ahead were so far short of the reality. The crisis ""led to significantly increased travel restrictions and cases of illness in the general population and among employees,"" says its spokesperson. ""This unexpectedly not only reduced the prior trend of recovery, but also triggered a significant slump in demand.""Last October, the aviation industry pledged at the International Air Transport Association (IATA) annual meeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Numerous players -- including hub-based carriers, low-cost airlines, regulators and environmental lobbyists -- are at loggerheads in a multi-way blame game over the absurd wastefulness of unnecessary flights. ""We're in a climate crisis, and the transport sector has the fastest-growing emissions in the EU -- pointless, polluting 'ghost flights' are just the tip of the iceberg,"" says Herwig Schuster, spokesperson for Greenpeace's ""European Mobility For All"" campaign. ""It would be irresponsible of the EU to not take the low-hanging fruit of ending ghost flights and banning short-haul flights where there's a reasonable train connection,"" he adds.So why on Earth are these Mary Celeste flights still ongoing -- and what are aviation's stakeholders doing to disentangle themselves from the red tape that has ensnared the airlines into this climate-damaging mess?Related contentHow close are we to guilt-free flying?Precious assetsThe reason airlines continue to operate these expensive flights is because the industry is engaged in a slots game more high stakes and lucrative than anything you'll find in Las Vegas.Even when passengers are staying away, airlines still need to protect their slots: their scheduled time on valuable routes.Slots are extremely precious assets for airlines. With more than 200 of the planet's busiest hubs operating at full capacity, demand for flights exceeds the availability of runways and space inside the terminals.To manage this, capacity at congested airports is segmented into slots. These are the facility to land, disembark passengers, refuel, take on a new cohort of passengers and then take off again -- all within a specified and regulated time frame.Carriers then plan their schedules based on slot availability at both ends of the route. To maximize revenue, the schedules have to align with demand -- early morning slots for business travelers traveling short-haul, same-day-return trips are highly prized.But synchronizing the timing of both ends of the journey when the most desirable airports are full up is no easy feat.""If you take off from one place you need to know you can land at a certain time at another,"" says Paul Steele of the IATA. ""If you tinker with slot allocation at one end of the process, it creates chaos at the other end, and therefore we need a harmonized system.""That's where the Worldwide Airport Slot Guidelines (WASG) come in. These are the foundation upon which the global slot allocation process works. The Guidelines (jointly published by IATA, Airports Council International and the Worldwide Airport Coordinators Group) aspire to deliver ""transparency, flexibility, certainty, consistency and sustainability ... for the benefit of airlines, airports and consumers.""Lufthansa's boss says the group will have to run 18,000 unnnecessary flights over the winter season in order to hold onto its airport slots. Silas Stein/AFP/Getty ImagesMind-boggling systemBut with airlines operating hundreds of city-pair routes -- some synchronized with connecting flights -- this is a mind-boggling system to administer, and the allocation must be done twice a year for the summer and winter season schedules.To re-plan all of this every six months would be too complicated, so there's a rule that states that if an airline successfully uses its slot at least 80% of the time, it is allowed to retain the slot the following season, a system known as ""grandfather rights.""There's therefore very little flexibility in the network for introducing new routes, especially at congested airports. And that's why slots are gold dust.In the UK, Heathrow Airport holds the most valuable slots. Limited capacity there has propelled the price of slots skywards, with an early morning slot pair worth around $19 million, falling to $13 million at midday and $6 million in the evening, according to a UK House of Commons briefing paper.Record-breaking deals where airlines have traded these slots include the case of Oman Air, which was reported to have paid $75 million for a pair of takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow in early 2016. In March 2017, SAS Scandinavian Airlines sold two slot pairs at Heathrow to American Airlines for $75 million, according to the same paper. Usually, however, airlines keep these contractual details under wraps.Slots can also be traded in other ways, such as swaps between carriers, similar to the way that football teams have players out on loan.Because of the ""grandfather rights"" system, airlines reducing their use of the slots risk losing them. Cutting capacity is threatening the airlines' hold on their slots, which is why planes might still be operated even when hardly anyone is flying in them.Related contentThe rapid rise of 'red tourism' in China Loosening the red tapeTwo years ago, when the initial impact of Covid decimated the airline networks, the 80% rule was relaxed.In the United States, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) waived the slot usage, just as it had previously suspended the regulation in 2002, 2003 and 2009 -- following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States; the outbreak of SARS; and the global financial crisis, respectively.And in Europe, for the current Winter 2021-2022 period, the ""use it or lose it"" threshold was lowered to 50%. But airlines are facing increased uncertainty and want greater latitude for retaining their slots. Air France-KLM Group, for example, issued a statement, seeking ""the current [Covid] situation to be better taken into account in the application of European regulations so that airlines can continue to adjust their offer to actual demand levels."" In particular, the Group seeks increased flexibility ""in the application of the force majeure rules allowing for derogations from the 50% slot utilization rule.""In response, and perhaps in recognition that the Omicron variant is now playing havoc with everybody's travel plans, the European Commission issued an extension to the slot relief rules effective until October 29, 2022. However the Commission is raising its threshold to 64% in April.""The progress in vaccination campaigns and the EU Digital Covid-19 Certificate have helped to restore traveler confidence and air connectivity in the EU, putting the industry in a stronger position to deal with short-term shocks,"" explains Adina Vălean, the EU's commissioner for transport. ""Even if we are not there yet, we can take a step further towards the return to normal airport slot management next summer."" Vălean says the EU is monitoring the situation, acknowledging the lingering impact of Omicron on airline bookings. ""The Commission has demonstrated throughout the Covid-19 crisis its willingness and ability to act swiftly where needed, and this will remain the case in the coming months,"" she adds. Heathrow is the UK's busiest airport. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images Europe/Getty ImagesPayback time?From the perspective of one of Europe's largest low-cost carriers, solving the problem of ghost flights may be straightforward.Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary says that, ""If Lufthansa really needs to operate these flights (solely to prevent the release of these slots to competitor airlines), then they should be required to sell these seats to the public at low fares."" O'Leary's contention is that Lufthansa and its subsidiary airlines (Brussels Airlines, Swiss and Austrian) have benefited from billions of State Aid. Consequently, ""instead of operating empty flights just so they can block slots, Lufthansa should release the seats on these flights for sale at low fares to reward the German and European taxpayers who have subsidized it with €billions during the Covid crisis,"" he says.However, Lufthansa's spokesperson argues that it's a different situation for larger airlines. ""Network companies like Lufthansa Group are more dependent on slots for feeder flights that connect passengers to long-haul routes at group hubs than low-cost airlines that tend to fly to smaller airports where there usually is no shortage of slots,"" he says. The only exception to the use-it-or-lose-it rule is the force majeure clause. However, this is not interpreted uniformly throughout Europe. Many countries grant no exceptions or only a few.Instigating exceptions is also very bureaucratic and time-consuming. Each exception must be granted individually: for the starting point and the destination -- therefore two approvals are always required. Since approvals are usually granted on short notice before a flight, there is no longer enough time for passengers to be rebooked.Lufthansa says it wants all EU member states to be granted exceptions to takeoff and landing rules so that the issue can be addressed flexibly, minimizing bureaucracy for the current winter schedule. ""The EU Commission should advocate uniform regulations so unnecessary flights are avoided and airlines are able to better plan,"" says its spokesperson.Protect and competeMeanwhile, ACI Europe, the professional association of airport operators which represents over 500 airports in 55 countries, has expressed dismay at the escalating industry and political rhetoric around ghost flights. It's also casting doubt on the reasoning of the major hub carriers that ghost flights are unavoidable.""A few airlines are claiming they are forced to run high volumes of empty flights in order to retain airport slot usage rights. There is absolutely no reason why this should be the reality,"" says ACI Europe director general, Olivier Jankovec. Slot usage rules, he says, need to achieve two things in the current circumstances: ""to protect airlines from the worst of unpredictabilities which are out of all our hands, and crucially, to also ensure that airport capacity is still used in a pro-competitive way.""Jankovec adds that reconciling commercial viability alongside the need to retain essential connectivity and protect against anti-competitive consequences is a delicate task: ""We believe that the European Commission has got this right. Talk of ghost flights, and of their environmental impacts, seems to hint at a doomsday scenario which has no place in reality. Let's stick to the vital task of recovering and rebuilding together"". And going one step further, on February 2, IATA released a statement welcoming updated guidance from the European Airport Coordinators Association, intended to provide a more harmonized policies on slot-use thresholds. Willie Walsh, IATA's director general, said such a move was crucial for ""sustaining critical European air connectivity"" and for ""leveling the playing field with jurisdictions that have recognized the need for full flexibility."" That promise of flexibility will be pivotal to the minimization of empty flights. But ultimately, their complete eradication will only be achieved when the public's propensity for air travel, facilitated by the eventual and complete conquest over the Covid virus, enables airlines to fill their planes with fare-paying passengers -- instead of ghosts.Top image: A plane flies over the Yas Viceroy Abu Dhabi Hotel in Abu Dhabi in November 2015.

travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/slovenia-julian-alps/index.html,Slovenia's Julian Alps: Explore this fairy-tale landscape ,,"(CNN) — Think of Slovenia's Julian Alps and two images often spring to mind -- the fairy-tale sight of Lake Bled and, if you're a winter-sports fan, the ski slopes of Kranjska Gora. But this alpine region tucked into Slovenia's northwestern corner is packed with natural wonders, many of which are contained within the country's only national park, Triglav.Since 2019, it's been easier to get to know this region thanks to the creation of the Juliana Trail. This 168-mile circuit winds through the foothills of the Julian Alps over 16 stages, beginning and ending in Kranjska Gora. (The trail also hives off into four more stages covering an extra 37 miles south toward Nova Gorica.) Along the way, you'll be treated to spectacular landscapes of towering peaks, waterfalls, rushing rivers and pristine mountain lakes. It's possible to pick and choose among the stages, or treat yourself to a few weeks of slow exploration. Here are some of the travel highlights. Lake BledThe poster boy for Slovenia tourism looks like something Walt Disney wishes he had dreamed up. Glassy turquoise waters surround a tiny island -- complete with a baroque church set among pines -- and the romance factor goes up a few notches when you arrive there on a traditional wooden boat called a pletna. Loftily perched on a cliff overlooking the lake is Bled Castle, a medieval fortress that adds even more romance to the scene. When not swimming in the lake (nicely warmed by thermal springs), visitors can go paddle-boarding or just wander along the four-mile path around the lake, soaking up those incomparable views.Tolmin GorgesTolmin Gorges: Deep green waters rushing between forested limestone walls.Adobe StockAt the southern end of Triglav National Park, the Tolmin Gorges slice through some of the Juliana Trail's most dramatic scenery. There's something almost primeval about these forested limestone walls looming over the Tolminka River, with deep green waters rushing below along the rocks. At the lowest point in the national park, at 590 feet (180 meters) above sea level, there's a confluence between the Tolmin and the Zadlaščica which you can access via rocky steps and picturesque wooden bridges.Lake BohinjLake Bohinj: Popular with paddlers.Adobe StockSlovenia's largest lake certainly gives Lake Bled a run for its money in the beauty stakes. Sheltered by forested mountains, Lake Bohinj's blue-green waters are an immensely peaceful place for lazy swims and laid-back paddling and kayaking. Follow the footpath that winds around the lake before taking the cable car that whisks you up more than 5,000 feet to the Vogel ski resort. From here, the views of Lake Bohinj are quite breathtaking.Related contentPredjama: The world's largest cave castle Savica WaterfallSavica Waterfall: The source of the Sava Bohinjka River.Adobe StockJust a couple of miles to the east of Lake Bohinj is one of Slovenia's loveliest natural attractions and worth a detour. Savica Waterfall is the source of the Sava Bohinjka River, and it thunders through a deep crevasse from a height of 255 feet into brilliant emerald-green waters. Take the marked trail from Zlatorog Hotel in Ukanc for about an hour until you reach the rocky steps that lead to the waterfall. There's a café nearby for a convenient pit stop.Zelenci Nature ReserveSpringwater gives the lake at Zelenci Nature Reserve an otherworldly turquoise hue.Adobe StockIf you're following the Juliana Trail in a clockwise direction, one of the final sights you'll pass will be the Zelenci Nature Reserve. It's quite an arresting sight: a lake of bright turquoise surrounded by marshy swamps and, beyond, the mountains of the Triglav National Park. Bubbling beneath are the springs of the source of the Sava River, giving the lake its jade color. Raised wooden walkways lead you through this serene landscape past more than 1,000 species of wildlife, including sand lizards and the rare scarlet grosbeak bird. Because the average temperature doesn't dip below 41 F (5 C), the waters never freeze, even during winter.Kranjska GoraKranjska Gora: Ski resort in winter, biking and hiking paradise in summer.Adobe StockSlovenia's best-known ski resort has all the prettiness you would expect of an alpine village. And when the snow melts, that's the cue to explore its mountain trails on foot or by bike. In a country that has produced Tour de France winners, it's not surprising that cycling is big business here. Ski lifts run during the summer too, giving downhill mountain bikers the chance to career down narrow tracks at breakneck speed. At nearby Planica -- home to one of Europe's premier ski-jumping centers -- you can fly through the air on the world's steepest zipline descent. For something gentler, pitch up on the shores of Jasna Lake, two connected artificial lakes at the confluence of the Velika Pišnica and Mala Pišnica streams.Related contentVipava Valley: Slovenia's beautiful hidden treasureSoča ValleyThe Soča River forms part of the Juliana Trail. Adobe StockFollow the mind-bending twists and turns of the Vršič Pass from Jasna Lake and you reach the Soča Valley. Part of the Juliana Trail follows the Soča River, one of the most exquisite in Europe, its impossibly clear blue-green waters a favorite with kayakers and rafters. Along the way are some of Slovenia's most magnificent waterfalls, including the mighty Boka and Kozjak, the latter dropping into a deep green pool of water. While the region appeals to active visitors, history buffs will want to explore the monuments from the Soča (Isonzo) Front during World War I. Strung out along a 143-mile path all the way to Trieste, the Walk of Peace is a poignant reminder of the many thousands who died here in battle during the conflict.Mount Triglav summitTriglav offers an adventurous ascent.Adobe StockHikers and climbers looking for a challenge will be tempted to deviate from the Juliana Trail and tackle the ascent to the summit of Mount Triglav. This hulking 9,296-feet limestone peak usually involves an overnight stay and a good level of fitness -- and it's worth considering hiring a guide. You can approach the mountain from several directions, but the two most popular routes start either in Lake Bohinj or Lake Bled. Be prepared for a bit of scrambling when you get close to the summit, which is accessible only from June to October."

The bush grows alongside a Catholic cathedral dedicated to St. Mary in Hildesheim, a beautiful medieval village noted for its ancient churches. Besides beauty and age, the plant exhibits remarkable fortitude. Allied bombing during World War II left the cathedral in ruins, but the rose, a Rosa canina, also known as the dog rose, somehow survived, flourished and now grows more than 30 feet high next to the apse of the restored church. Visit anytime, but late May and early June are the best times to see the delicate pink blossoms.PLANTED TREE: Approximately 2,300 yearsThe sacred Bodhi tree at Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi Temple in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. ShutterstockThe fig tree under which Siddhartha Gautama experienced enlightenment in India is long gone, but a cutting from it, carried by a royal devotee to Sri Lanka around 250 BCE, give or take a few decades, has grown into one of the most revered trees in the Buddhist world, and the oldest known tree with a planting recorded in history. Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, Ficus religiosa, has welcomed the religious, the curious and the nefarious in the centuries since. H.G. Wells marveled at it. Elephants damaged it. Tamil separatists besieged it. Today, pilgrims of all kinds pay homage, especially on full moon (poya) days, to the tree, which sits among elaborate gardens, canals, golden fences, religious stupas and younger Bodhi trees in the Mahamevnawa Gardens in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.WORKING TREE: Approximately 2,500 yearsWhether planted by man or nature, between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago, before the rise of Classical Greece, a seed sprouted on the Mediterranean island of Crete that to this day produces a yearly crop of olives.But the monumental tree in the village of Vouves does more than make drupe fruit. It and other ancient Olea europaea nearby, similar in wizened age and appearance, attract artists, religious leaders, Olympians and heads of state, inspired by their strikingly gnarly trunks and limbs. A museum highlighting the traditional olive harvesting techniques of Crete opened alongside the tree. Crete was once the seat of the Minoan civilization, which flourished in antiquity from its olive oil trade.Related content15 of nature's most awesome, must-see showsWILD HERB: Approximately 3,000 yearsThese eye-catching blobs are Andean shrubs that may date back thousands of years.ShutterstockThe Yareta or llareta, bright green blobs that resemble moss-covered boulders, are actually flowering shrubs perfectly designed to withstand the high-altitude conditions of the Andes Mountains in Peru, Bolivia, northern Chile and western Argentina. Wind, freezing temperatures and drought prove no match for Azorella compacta, a wild, inedible relative of parsley and fennel, which slowly and methodically ekes out an existence, growing as little as one meter a century. Because of their slow growth rate, the largest shrubs are thought to be approximately 3,000 years old.Given their density -- a shrub can easily support the weight of a human -- Yareta have been used like peat as a traditional fuel. Fortunately, South American governments have rallied to protect the endangered species.

They pepper the chilly waters around McMurdo Sound and their estimated age is based on the sheer size of the sponges, which only grow a tiny bit each year.They thrive in depths from 50 to 500 feet, sentinels of a deep realm they share with other strange creatures, like tiny crustaceans and wiggly worms that live inside the sponges, and packs of pin-cushioned sea stars that dine on the two-meter-tall monsters.

Their empty buildings, streets and even cars left for nature to reclaim over the years. Whether destroyed during war, evacuated for ammunition practice or cast aside after nearby precious metals and minerals turned out to be in short supply, here are some of the world's most fascinating abandoned towns and cities.Oradour-Sur-Glane, FranceThe village of Oradour-sur-Glane was the site of a horrific massacre during World War II.Adobe StockThe ruins of this former fishing village serve as a stark reminder of the horrors of World War II. Oradour-Sur-Glane has been left relatively untouched since June 10, 1944, when much of its population was massacred by the Waffen SS, a military branch of the Nazi Party's SS organization.During the atrocity, men were shot and killed in barns, while women and children were also murdered when the church they were locked in was blown up. Survivors were gunned down as they fled. Wartime leader Charles De Gaulle later decided that Oradour-Sur-Glane should be left as a testament to Nazi cruelty. A new village with a memorial museum, open since 1999, has been built near by.Wharram Percy, United KingdomWharram Percy has been empty for 500 years.Adobe StockArguably England's best known deserted medieval village, Wharram Percy, found in the beautiful Yorkshire Wolds, was once home to two stunning manor houses and a church. The latter is the only building still standing, but the foundations of the houses, built by the noble Percy family, can still be seen, as can those of the surrounding peasant homes. The village population dwindled for years as locals moved away due to a shift towards sheep farming. It was abandoned not long after 1500, when the last remaining residents were evicted.Today the site, now managed by English Heritage, is a major draw for archaeologists and tourists alike.Belchite, SpainBelchite has been left relatively untouched since it was destroyed in the Spanish Civil War.Adobe StockOn the front line between Republican and fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War, Belchite was the center of a weeks-long siege between August and September 1937, before finally falling to General Francisco Franco's forces in 1939.Left much as it was then, the tiny village located south of Zaragoza in northeastern Spain stands as a memorial to those who fell, the ruins of its stunning church particularly affecting.The deserted spot, where a new village, built in 1939, can be found close by, makes for an interesting day trip from Zaragoza.Craco, ItalyCraco has been a ghost town since the late 20th century.Adobe StockLocated in the far south of Italy, Craco's vertiginous location and spectacular architecture make it one of the most visually arresting abandoned towns in the world. Residents began to leave after a series of landslides caused by sewage and water works in the 1960s, and Craco was left completely deserted in the wake of the Irpinia earthquake in 1980. Since then, not only has the ghost town pulled in thousands of tourists, its also become an popular filming location, featuring in movies like 2008 James Bond offering ""Quantum of Solace.""

The history of Grand-Bassam dates back much further than the French. The Nzema people, also known as Ndenye or Apollonians, of the Ivory Coast are thought to have lived here from the 15th century, growing the town into a lively port and fishing village before the arrival of colonists.Kolmanskop, NamibiaKolmanskop in Namibia was one of the richest towns in Africa years before it was abandoned.Adobe StockWith many of its buildings half-submerged in sand, Kolmanskop stands as an eerie reminder of what was once a buzzing town in the heart of the Namib desert.Founded after local worker Zacharias Lewala discovered diamonds here in 1908, it saw a huge influx of German miners and became a bustling hub before it was finally abandoned in 1956. Built to mimic a German town, Kolmanskop had a ballroom, a casino and even a tram system. Tourists come here to witness how the desert has reclaimed the buildings, with the entire town slowly disappearing forever beneath the sand.Related contentThe Sicilian ghost town that refuses to dieBodie, CaliforniaDiscarded cars lie rusting in California ghost town Bodie.Adobe Stock Perhaps the most famous of the Wild West boomtowns of the late 19th century, Bodie's population grew from a handful of prospectors to 10,000 people in the late 1870s. With rich seams of gold to be found, people flocked to the Californian town, positioned near the Nevada border, to make their fortune, with an incredible 65 saloons, a Wells Fargo bank and even a Chinatown replete with Taoist temple. But Bodie's appeal had faded by the early 20th century, as other boomtowns rose to prominence, and its population fell to just 120 in 1920. The deserted town's well-preserved buildings make it a memorable stop off on Wild West tours today.Hashima Island, JapanHashima Island was abandoned in 1974.Adobe StockAlso known as Battleship Island, Hashima, off the coast of Nagasaki, operated as an undersea coal mining facility between 1887 and 1974. But it was cast aside as demand for coal dissipated, and nature has since taken over the buildings on the island.While its become a significant tourist destination over the years, Hashima has a dark past, having been used as a forced labor camp during World War II. Over 1,000 Korean and Chinese civilians and prisoners of war are said to have perished here.Pyramiden, NorwayPositioned on the archipelago of Svalbard, this Soviet coal mining settlement has been out of use since 1998.Adobe StockSituated high above the Arctic Circle on the Svalbard archipelago, Pyramiden was once a successful coal mining settlement. Sold to the Soviets by Sweden in 1927, the remote town is dotted with classic architecture from the Communist period, from housing blocks to a Heliport. Coal hasn't been mined here since 1998, but tourists can now stay at a dedicated hotel and book official tours of its neglected buildings.Those who visit Pyramiden will first need to reach the remote town of Longyearbyen, before taking a boat or snowmobile for the final stretch.Related contentCalifornia ghost town sells for $1.4 millionPripyat, UkraineThe Ukrainian city of Pripyat was evacuated the day after the nuclear blast at Chernobyl.Adobe StockPripyat was given city status in 1979, some nine years after it was founded to house workers at the nearby Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The Ukrainian city was home to around 50,000 people when it was evacuated on April 27, 1986, following the now infamous disaster at Chernobyl.While tourists have been arriving here in increasing numbers, despite the dangers from nuclear fallout, in recent years, this remains a deeply melancholy place, frozen in time. In early 2020, former residents of Pripyat returned for the first time as part of celebrations to mark 50 years since it was established.Tyneham, United KingdomDorset village Tyneham was evacuated in November 1943 and the area is now used for military training.Adobe StockWhen villagers in Tyneham, in the bucolic county of Dorset, were ordered to leave by Britain's War Office in November 1943, they assumed they'd be back once World War II was over. However, having used the village to train troops in the run up to D-Day -- the military term for the first day of the Normandy landings -- the UK government took out a compulsory purchase order in 1948. Tyneham now serves as part of the military firing ranges that make up this part of England, although it is open to the public at weekends and on select public holidays. Wildlife has taken over somewhat, with rare species making the most of a lack of nearby farm fields or resident human population. Ruby, ArizonaRuby, a privately owned ghost town based in Southern Arizona.AlamyAbandoned since 1941, a year after its once productive mine was closed, Ruby remains one of the best preserved ghost towns in the US. Positioned close to the Mexico border, the town boomed in the 1930s, with a population of 1,200 mostly mining gold, silver, lead and zinc. Ruby is now privately owned, and visitors can pay around $15 to spend a day exploring its derelict buildings and miles of desert trails. The town's well preserved jail, school house and mine works make it a fascinating place to visit.Arltunga, AustraliaDeserted gold rush town Arltunga in the Northern Territory of Australia.Adobe StockBilled as the first official town in the harsh outback of Central Australia, Arltunga has a long indigenous history dating back 20,000 years. However, the ghost town that remains was built in 1887 by European settlers in search of gold, and had a population of around 300 at one stage.While it's possible to visit Arltunga, situated east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, to view its well preserved mineworks and other buildings all year, it's best to go between April and September, when the weather is cooler.

Inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Great Tower of London was poised to surpass it in height and reach almost 1,200 feet.Instead, it never went past the first construction stage, which came to be known as the ""London Stump."" It was demolished almost 120 years ago, leaving behind an unfulfilled dream and large concrete foundations that were rediscovered in 2002, when the current stadium was built to replace an older one. So what went wrong?The tower was the brainchild of Edward Watkin, a British politician and railway tycoon whose previous endeavors included a failed attempt to build a tunnel under the English Channel, more than 100 years before the current Eurotunnel began construction.'Bigger the better'One of the tower designs that didn't get picked. The Public Domain Review""Watkin was a born entrepreneur and he loved big ideas -- the bigger the better,"" says Christopher Costelloe, an expert on Victorian architecture and an inspector of historic buildings at public heritage organization Historic England. ""I think he had a tendency to get so excited with his ideas that he often plowed ahead before thinking about how practical or financially viable they were.""The Eiffel Tower, which opened in 1889, quickly became a popular tourist attraction and its construction costs were recouped in a matter of months. At the same time, Watkin was looking for ways to attract more passengers onto his Metropolitan Railway -- which would later become the Metropolitan line on the London Underground.The railway passed through Wembley, then a rural hamlet northwest of central London, where Watkin had purchased land to create an amusement park: ""It was meant to be the Disneyland of its day, or the successor to the early 19th-century leisure parks like Battersea Park in London or Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen,"" says Costelloe. What better than a tower taller than the Eiffel to convince Londoners to board a train to get there?Watkin had the audacity to ask Gustave Eiffel himself to design it, but the French engineer refused on patriotic grounds. His plan B was an international design competition, with a first prize of 500 guineas, about $80,000 in today's money. He received 68 submissions, not all of them realistic. One was 2,000 feet tall and was meant to have a train running halfway to the top, on a spiraling railway. Another was designed as an ""aerial colony"" with sky gardens, museums and galleries, as well as a reproduction of the Great Pyramid at the top. Most, however, matched the aesthetics of the Eiffel, and it was one of these that Watkin selected as the winner, submitted by London architects Stewart, McLaren and Dunn. ""The winning proposal was a more slender version of the Eiffel Tower. Very similar in its overall profile, but the structure was sort of skinnier,"" says Costelloe. At 1,200 feet, it was also about 175 feet taller than its Parisian counterpart, which was the world's tallest building at the time.Related contentRobert Bartini: The world's most mysterious aircraft designerA not-so-popular attractionThe first, and only, completed stage of the tower.AlamyAll entries were collected in a catalog, published in 1890, which described the project in detail and revealed that the London tower would be ""much more spacious"" than the Eiffel and include ""restaurants, theaters, shops, Turkish baths, promenades, winter gardens and a variety of other amusements,"" all reachable via a recent invention, the electric elevator. An observation deck would offer panoramic views and astronomical observations, facilitated by the ""purity of air"" found at such an ""immense height.""After the initial fanfare, however, the proposed design was scaled down to make it cheaper to build, and the legs were reduced from the original eight to four, the same number as the Eiffel. Construction began in 1892, and the first stage -- approximately 150 feet tall -- was finished three years later. Wembley Park had opened the year before and was enjoying moderate success, but the tower still had a long way to go -- and there was something wrong with it. ""When they reached the first stage, it soon became clear that the building was subsiding. Not so badly that they couldn't use it, but they certainly realized they'd have big problems if they carried on building it higher, increasing the strain on the legs,"" says Costelloe.Although it was opened to the public and elevators were installed, the tower was doomed. ""One of the main problems was that Watkin died in 1901,"" Costelloe adds. ""He had been the driving force behind the project and with his death all that was left was a rational calculation of costs and benefits. People could go up to the first stage, but that wasn't quite high enough to get the sort of panoramic views you'd get from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and the surrounding area wasn't particularly developed or spectacular. ""There just weren't enough visitors to pay for finishing it."" Related contentThe UK wants to build one of the world's most ambitious bridgesTallest in townOnce Watkin died, the impetus for building the tower was lost.Herbert Barraud/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesA year after Watkin's death, the tower was declared unsafe and closed down. Shortly after, it was demolished with dynamite. The surrounding Wembley area, however, continued to flourish as an industrial and residential London suburb. In 1923, a stadium, which would later be known as the original Wembley Stadium, was erected on the former site of the tower. Its demolition to make way for the current Wembley Stadium eventually unearthed the tower's foundations, when work to lower the level of the new pitch was undertaken. It was a late reminder of the failed tower, also referenced by a pub in the area called ""Watkin's Folly"" (it closed permanently in 2019).Remarkably, Watkin's Tower would still be London's tallest building today, surpassing The Shard skyscraper by almost 160 feet. But would it be an iconic landmark like the Eiffel Tower? Probably not, says Costelloe: ""It would still have been a very big structure on the skyline, but seen only in certain views,"" he says.  ""Not being in the center of London, it would never have had the sort of dominating focus that the Eiffel Tower has in Paris."""
travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-airplane-schereeya-anton/index.html,Two strangers meet on an airplane. Four years later they fall in love,,"(CNN) — Whenever high school senior Schereéya boarded an airplane, it was with a particular thought in mind: ""What if I meet the person I'm going to marry on board?""Schereéya, who uses they/them pronouns, had always figured meeting a partner on a plane was inherently romantic and, as such, was always prepared for an in-flight meet-cute.""I always tried to be as cute as possible when I traveled, just in case,"" Schereéya tells CNN Travel today, laughing.This particular flight was already a significant one. It was 2010 and Schereéya was traveling solo to their soon-to-be-college-state of Virginia. They'd been accepted into Washington and Lee University and the flight felt like the beginning of a new stage of life, replete with possibilities.""I went to a science and math boarding school,"" explains Schereéya. ""So I was just very excited to be away from school, so excited to be going somewhere else.""Boarding the plane, Schereéya did their usual scan around the other passengers -- were any of the travelers future-spouse material? Quickly, Schereéya attention zoned in on a young guy, sat near the back, in a red sweatshirt.He was attractive, thought Schereéya, and looked like he could be a high school senior. Maybe he was also traveling to the Washington and Lee acceptance day? Perhaps they'd get chatting? Maybe he was the one? But when Schereéya sat down in their seat -- the row in front of the red-sweatshirt-wearing stranger -- they were quickly distracted by their seatmate, who happened to be from Japan. Schereéya had studied Japanese at high school, and was thrilled to get a chance to test out these linguistic skills in person. As the plane was waiting to take off, Schereéya and their seat neighbor started chatting in Japanese.That's when the guy behind Schereéya took notice.It turned out Schereéya's instincts were correct -- this was Anton, also a high school senior, and he was also en route to the Washington and Lee University college acceptance day. Schereéya and Anton have asked that only their first names be used for privacy reasons.Anton says he was immediately enthralled by Schereéya -- who he'd noticed when they boarded the plane -- and bowled over at the ease and confidence in which they slipped into Japanese.""I was thinking to myself, 'Who is that?'"" Anton recalls.Anton had grown up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was his second visit to Washington and Lee, but his first time flying there. In fact, it was his first time flying, period.""So my mind was sort of wrapped up in that -- I was super excited about it -- I'm a bit of a nerd,"" says Anton. ""I'm interested in flight and so being able to fly for the first time was a huge deal for me.""When the aircraft took off, Anton stopped focusing on Schereéya, and was completely engrossed in the flying experience.""Once the plane started moving, I just stared out the window the whole time,"" he says.The aircraft landed in Roanoke Regional Airport, which is about 50 miles from Washington and Lee University. The college had put on transport for the transiting students.It was while disembarking the airplane that Schereéya spotted Anton again. Soon they found themselves standing together at the airport, both unsure of their next steps.Schereéya was wearing a Washington and Lee sweatshirt, and hoped the stranger might notice that and make conversation.But Anton, who is a little more reserved, didn't say anything.""I was super nervous and self-conscious,"" he says.Eventually, Schereéya introduced themselves. The two figured out they were both heading to the same place. Before long, they were sat next to one another for the hour-long bus ride to their college.""I remember thinking like, this is such a good day. I'm going to college. There's a cute boy,"" says Schereéya.""It was a good day,"" agrees Anton.College lifeThe accepted students were due to spend the whole weekend getting a taste of the college lifestyle.They recall going to a party together, and dancing. They also attended a panel discussion for Black students on campus.""Seeing another person there who was kind of just as outgoing in that setting and asking a bunch of questions too, also made me pay attention,"" says Anton.When the weekend wound to a close, Schereéya left Virginia regarding Anton as a good friend, and looked forward to spending more time together when the semester started later that year.""But we didn't really hang out that much the first few years of college,"" says Schereéya.Anton was focused on studying, and when he wasn't concentrating on his school work, he was involved in an organization or club. While the two did have mutual friends, they often moved in different circles.But despite the fact they didn't see one another often, Schereéya always thought fondly of the guy from the plane. ""In my mind, because of that first weekend, we were just like besties -- like we went all the way back,"" says Schereéya.They'd often text one another via Blackberry messenger, especially during vacations, when Anton was less focused on studying.""Most of the time that we had more intense interactions was over the summers,"" says Anton. ""We kept trying to have these connections to hang out and then they kept just getting missed all the time,"" adds Schereéya.Their time at college rolled on. They rarely met up, but they remained in one another's orbit.""I just liked talking to him, text back and forth,"" says Schereéya. ""And I just got really used to it, he became a person that I loved talking to -- and then he started dating somebody.""When Schereéya heard Anton was in a relationship, they were shocked.Schereéya recalls their college roommate raising an eyebrow at this reaction.""I was not expecting you to have this reaction to the news that Anton was dating someone,"" Schereéya's roommate said.""I was not expecting me to have this reaction either,"" Schereéya recalls responding.""That's actually how I found out that I liked him.""Anton says he'd always liked Schereéya, but he never thought he had a chance with them.""I just thought Schereéya was out of my league,"" he recalls.The winter of their senior year, Schereéya was going through a tough time.""I was just struggling. And he noticed,"" Schereéya says, recalling Anton approaching them at a party when they were sitting in a corner.Schereéya opened up to Anton, and he listened.""No one else would ever listen to some person in the corner crying about how hard life is when everyone's trying to party,"" says Schereéya.After this moment of connection, the two started spending time together, just the two of them, for really the first time since they'd crossed paths on the airplane years earlier.""He was like, 'We'll have lunch together, you need some more levity in your life,' or 'Let's go get ice cream.' So we started hanging out a lot and talking a lot more,"" says Schereéya.Related contentGirl meets girl at band camp. They fall in loveNew Orleans road tripAnton and Schereéya photographed together in 2014.Schereéya & AntonWinter rolled into spring, and Anton invited Schereéya on a road trip he was planning with some friends to New Orleans, some 13 hours away.""We had been hanging out a ton and we were getting pretty close by that point,"" says Anton. ""And we ended up traveling down together, and we talked the entire 13 hours.""""And I, at that point had like a full-fledged, like a full-blown crush,"" says Schereéya, laughing. ""I was telling my roommate as I was packing my stuff like, 'We should be dating by the time we get there and engaged by the time we get back. Thirteen hours, are you kidding me? It's such a long drive.'""For Anton, this experience cemented his feeling that he and Schereéya could be an item. It was something he'd been wondering about since they'd started spending more time together. Now he felt sure.""I was thinking to myself, 'If I can talk to you for 13 straight hours, we can do anything together. We'll never be bored.'""Early in the New Orleans trip, the two were walking down a street when they noticed a jazz band playing at a restaurant.""That looks like it would be a good place for a date,"" Anton said, indicating at the bar.""Are you asking me on a date?"" Schereéya asked. Anton admitted he was.""So then we went on the date,"" Schereéya recalls today. ""And then we're not even paying attention to the other people on this trip anymore. It was just how many dates in New Orleans can we fit in before we have to go back home.""It was March, and Schereéya and Anton were due to graduate college in May. Their fledgling relationship had a bit of a question mark hanging over it, as they didn't know what their future would be. But they soon realized they were naturally factoring one another into their plans -- both short-term and long-term.""Because we were in such a transitional phase of life -- where we were trying to imagine what the future looks like -- we began to have conversations. It was like, 'When we're at the Oscars, because you're winning for a movie that you've written,"" or 'When we're going to school dances, because you're the principal of the school,'"" Schereéya recalls.""I guess when I imagine the future, I do imagine that you're in it,"" Anton recalls telling Schereéya.Schereéya was soon whiling away afternoons wedding planning on Pinterest, daydreaming about a future with Anton.Anton was more practical-minded, but also felt increasingly certain. He knew he shared a lot of important core values with Schereéya , and that was only becoming clearer as they spent more time together.""Seeing those values line up was one of the things that gave me the peace to say, 'Well the timing is bad, because we're about to graduate, and I don't know if this is going to work out. But it feels right. And we believe the same things. So maybe we'll just see what happens,"" he recalls.""I think things sort of organically evolved.

Proposing inside the airport wouldn't be easy, but some friends of Anton's from his church told him about the Roanoke Star, an illuminated star-shaped sculpture on nearby Mill Mountain that overlooks the runways. It was the perfect location, and when Anton and Schereéya arrived there one June evening, the ring in Anton's pocket, Anton was certain it was the right choice.

He was paranoid that Schereéya had realized there was a ring in his pocket when they'd put their hand in there as an affectionate gesture earlier that day.""I had been planning like, 'What does one say?' in this moment in my head. And that's never good, because once I got in my head, it felt super awkward,"" he recalls.

It's billed on Amtrak's website as ""a grand west coast train adventure,"" and a quick Google search turns up a number of travel blogs and YouTube videos boasting picturesque scenery along the way.After having been stuck in Hong Kong -- quarantine capital of the world -- for more than 20 months, I decided to give it a go in November.Some travelers make it a multi-day trip, getting off to kayak in the mountain lakes of Oregon's Klamath Falls or going wine tasting in California's Paso Robles, before jumping back on. But I had a schedule to stick to and a Thanksgiving dinner waiting for me, so I decided to make it a straight ride: 24 hours on the train from Seattle to San Francisco.The Coast Starlight train at the Salem Rail Station on October 15, 2020.Brian Hayes/Statesman Journal/ImagnThe Pacific NorthwestI chose the most affordable option of a coach seat (starting from about $100), which had more leg room than I anticipated -- not that I spent much time in it. For much of the trip, I sat in the sightseer lounge, the main attraction of the Coast Starlight -- an airy observation car with windows that stretch up to the ceiling, allowing expansive views.As the train pulled away from Seattle, I spotted the looming silhouette of Mount Rainier and its distinctive flat volcanic top in the distance. We passed by lush Pacific Northwest forests with evergreen Douglas firs and hemlock trees; some remnants of fall still dotted the landscape with yellow and orange.The sightseer lounge on the Coast Starlight train, pictured on November 24, 2021.Jessie Yeung/CNNOne of the pleasures of train travel -- perhaps particularly for international visitors like myself -- is getting a peek at different slices of life along the route. There were damp fields covered by hundreds of pumpkins; a house buried deep in the woods, a man mowing the lawn outside; horses wearing winter jackets, ducks wading in ponds and cows grazing on stubbly grass. One woman on her porch waved to the passing train; delighted, I waved back.We rode through small towns and industrial centers, too -- lumber mills, a recycling plant, and warehouses containing stacks of hay and timber.A view from the window of the Coast Starlight.James Orndorf/ShutterstockIt was cloudy that day, which offered its own surprises as we moved through Washington. At one point, Mount St. Helen's snow-covered peak rose out of nowhere, before it was swallowed up again just as quickly.November meant the sky began darkening by 4 p.m., soon after we crossed the state line into Oregon. As night fell, I turned my focus to a more pressing problem: what to eat and how to sleep.Related content11 of the world's most luxurious train journeysThe amenitiesIf you have a flexible budget for a long train trip, it might be wise to spend a little more on a sleeper car.The Coast Starlight offers roomettes, a bedroom option, a bedroom suite and larger family bedrooms -- ranging from about $430 to $1,325. Though they differ in size and comfort, they offer three crucial amenities: a horizontal surface for sleep, complimentary meals and in-room or in-car private restrooms and showers. Normally, coach passengers are allowed to order meals from the dining car and participate in ""community seating,"" where you eat and chat with other passengers. But that program has been suspended due to the pandemic, which means coach passengers are limited to buying food from a small cafe where most items are frozen or prepackaged. The cafe works fine for a few meals -- I had microwaved mac and cheese for lunch and cup noodles for dinner -- but by the end of the first day I was thinking longingly of the menu offered to passengers with private rooms, which includes fresh salads, pasta dishes, grilled salmon, omelets -- the works.The dining car of the Coast Starlight, where passengers were allowed to eat and chat together pre-pandemic, photographed on December 16, 2017.Nicole Evatt/APAs it got late, I settled in my coach seat for the night. The seat can recline pretty far back, but I still found my back aching and woke up periodically. Even so, I managed to sleep seven hours as the train cut through Oregon.During the summer when days stretch longer, passengers might catch a glimpse of the waterfalls near Portland, or forest views as the train climbs up the Cascades and through the steep Sacramento River Valley. As it was, those views were obscured by darkness -- and by the time I woke, the sun was beginning to creep over the horizon as the train approached Sacramento, California.Related contentRomancing the rails on Amtrak's CrescentCalifornia, here we comeAs we made our way through the northern part of the state, waterlogged fields and marshes gave way to palm trees and fishermen surrounding the San Pablo Bay.At one point, the train tracks were so close to the shore that it looked like we were gliding directly on the water -- nothing but blue waves outside the window.Before I knew it, we were pulling into Oakland just outside San Francisco, and my 24 hours had come to an end. If I had continued on to the end of the line, I might have seen the low rolling Santa Cruz mountains; the strawberry fields and apple orchards in the Santa Clara Valley; and the stunning blue ocean of the southern California coast, with the train following the Pacific coastline for more than 100 miles.The train perhaps isn't the most efficient way to travel (before the trip, multiple friends checked that I did, in fact, know a plane could do the trick in two hours instead of 24) -- or the most comfortable unless you book a sleeper car.

travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airline-route-maps/index.html,Why airline route maps look the way they do,,"(CNN) — If you've ever played with the in-flight route maps on board a plane or browsed the destinations on an airline's website, it all looks pretty simple. To get from A to B, you simply rise to 30,000 feet and take the most direct path through clear, empty air, right? The reality, of course, is a little more complicated. Route planning is dictated by a range of factors including weather, geopolitics, how much a country charges for aircraft to fly over its territory, and even runway length. Even those back-of-seat maps don't give you the full story: They'd need to be updated in real time just to keep up with variable wind speeds and political bickering. An in-seat screen on an Air India flight.  Nicolas Economou/NurPhotoGetty Images100 years of route mapsOfficial airline route maps first appeared in the 1920s, in the early days of commercial aviation. The focus was on their use as a marketing tool, rather than geographic accuracy.Flying was significantly more expensive during the first decades of passenger service. In the early 1950s, the average domestic US round trip cost at least 5% of the average annual income (make that close to $2,000 in today's world). It was only with the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 that US airfares stopped being set by the federal government, which paved the way for greater competition and much lower prices. Thus, in order to appeal to upper income brackets, early route maps would be fancifully decorated, with the emphasis on cultivating wanderlust by introducing new and exotic locales.Although transcontinental railroads and mass transit system maps had been in use since the late 1800s, they were more functional than vivid, whereas airlines like Pan Am and KLM used multiple colors and themes to show off their ever-expanding presence.Without showing scales or legends, they would merely connect airports, with exaggerated straight lines being drawn between the airline's home airports, better known as hubs, and its route network. The point of the maps -- nicknamed aerial road maps by American Airlines in the 1930s -- was to make the graphics easy to understand, captivate the audience, serve as fun souvenirs, and even help passengers keep track of the newest destinations.""Pan American"" physical map with red lines tracing the airline's international routes, cartography by John Brown for Pan Am, 1968. Potter and Potter Auctions/Gado/Archive Photos/Getty ImagesThe jet ageThough the world's first jet plane, the Heinkel He 178, took flight in 1939, it was years before the first commercial jet flew paying passengers on a scheduled service. On May 2, 1952, the British Overseas Aircraft Corporation (BOAC), using the 44-seat De Havilland Comet 1A, took flight between London and Johannesburg, inspiring aircraft manufacturers in Europe, North America, and the former Soviet Union to develop their own prototypes.As newer aircraft were able to fly longer distances at higher altitudes and with less of a need to refuel at intermediate stops, so too did airlines continue to grow their reach around the world, expanding throughout newly independent countries in Africa and Asia, in addition to growing tourism and business hotspots in the traditional aviation markets of Europe and North America.The Heinkel He 179 was the world's first jet plane and was used by the Luftwaffe during World War II. Apic/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesGeopoliticsHowever,there's more to connecting two points than simply having the appropriate aircraft. And sometimes it's politically expedient for airlines to steer clear of explaining why their route maps might look a certain way.Two particular examples, El Al of Israel, and China Airlines of Taiwan, have had to avoid the airspace of certain neighbors for decades.In 1948, the same year that Israel was founded, the national air carrier El Al was formed as a source of pride and hope for the fledgling state.Though the initial commercial routes, to Rome and Paris, were comparatively simple to navigate, once Israel established diplomatic relations with South Africa, Thailand, and India, it would be an understatement to say that setting up routes to Johannesburg, Bangkok, and Beijing was merely a matter of selling tickets.When the British administration in Sudan began giving way to local Arab government in the mid-1950s, according to Maurice Wickstead of theaviationhistorian.com, ""This necessitated a major diversion avoiding hostile nations bordering the Red Sea.""Rerouting via Turkey, Iran, Oman, Somalia and Kenya ""added around 2,400 miles to the straight-line distance and five hours flying time,"" says Wickstead. ""This situation was not rectified until Israel gained control over the Sinai Peninsula"" and direct flights over Ethiopia could be made. Things also improved in September 2020 when Saudi Arabia started allowing Israeli aircraft to fly over its territory, not only for its new routes to the United Arab Emirates, but also occasionally for flights from East Asia. As Ian Petchenik of FlightRadar24 notes, ""the most geopolitically consequential routing changes in the Middle East in 2020 also carry the most practical consequences for airlines, saving time and fuel.""

Monty Fresco/Picture Post/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Taiwanese airlines have their own unique issues when plotting their daily flight routes. As China's economy has exponentially grown since the late 1970s, Beijing feels more empowered to show off its increasingly high-tech military capabilities, particularly in Fujian province, directly across the Strait of Taiwan.Moreover, Taiwan -- also known as the Republic of China -- was expelled from the United Nations in 1971, at the same time the China -- or, the People's Republic of China - took its place. According to the Asian Maritime Transparency Initiative, ""Taiwan's exclusion from the international body means it has no formal avenue for registering complaints against China's aviation actions."" Naturally, China has separately been more open to discussions with Taiwan increasing flights between the two when Taiwanese leadership is pro-Beijing.Still, in spite of regional aggression, airlines have been flying between Taiwan and China on a charter basis since 2005, with scheduled flights happening since 2008. (Previously, in order to get between mainland China and Taiwan, one would have to transit another airport, likely Hong Kong or Macao). However, where things get a bit trickier is when China Airlines and Eva Air, both based in Taiwan, depart for Europe.Chinese airspaceAlthough official documentation is difficult to come by, as a rule, Taiwanese airlines are unable to use Chinese airspace. A possible reason is that the Chinese military controls most of mainland airspace, not to mention Chinese airlines have had massive domestic growth in the past twenty years, further crowding up the skies. Yet, Taiwanese flights returning from Europe have recently been allowed to overfly southern Chinese airspace; in fact, the three European carriers to fly to Taipei: Turkish Airlines, KLM, and Air France, are also only able to use southern Chinese airspace, regardless of whether they are flying to/from Europe.In conclusion, it's easy enough to visit an airline's website, scope out the route map, and dream up your next vacation. Yet until now, you may never have thought about the process through which daily flights around the world must carefully tread: to name just a few, national borders, storms, war zones, pandemics, and temporary airspace restrictions, such as for visits by world leaders, and major sporting championships.Top image -- A an aircraft flies over Eindhoven, The Netherlands, on December 16, 2021 (Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images)"

Johnny Vegas poolside with Belgian footballer Romelu Lukaku. @johnny1vegasHaving already established himself in parts of the United States and Spain, Vegas is looking to expand his concierge empire in Dubai. He sees the most visited-city in the Middle East as an ideal destination; the climate in the United Arab Emirates is perfectly suited to athletes chasing some winter sun, as temperatures rarely dip below 25 degrees Celsius (77 F). American and British paparazzi photographers are thin on the ground, giving his clientele much-needed privacy. And while the Emirate's hospitality industry is still recovering from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the city is beginning to come alive again. Occupancy rates touched 90% in October 2021 as Dubai hosted international events like Expo 2020 and cricket's T20 World Cup. Certainly, in the five-star hotel Vegas is in, the party has started down at the pool, and the sounds of the latest hits filter up to the balcony. ""[Covid] was a restart button to evaluate who we are as a business, for myself as an individual, and to come back and kind of combat what was happening in front of us,"" says Vegas. ""Let's study the market, let's study the culture, let's understand how businesses function here."" And with most of Klodout's clients being world-class soccer players, the company's biggest event of 2022 will be in the Middle East. The soccer World Cup in Qatar promises to bring players from 32 nations to the region, and some will want to have luxury time in the sun. For Vegas, it's a potential goldmine.

Although he moved away at the age of 10, his Ethiopian roots remain important to him. ""Ethiopia is my blood, this is who I am,"" he says. ""I appreciate it. I acknowledge it."" After moving to the United States -- his first experience of air travel -- he adopted the name of Johnny because kids in his new hometown, Las Vegas, struggled to pronounce Yohanes. Later, in an earlier job working as a valet at the Bellagio casino, customers would save his contact in their phones as ""Johnny Vegas,"" and the name stuck.

Vegas earned the trust of high-profile celebrities while they waited for their cars. He made friends and swapped favors, and before long, had fallen into the concierge business with a valuable rolodex.Friends of the stars Kloudout's clients can be highly specific and exacting in their requests, Vegas says. The company's 10 employees even take care of any fitness requirements athletes might have while they're away, paying particular attention to the specialized workouts needed to play each sport.

But partway through the 56-minute ride, it passes through another engineering marvel: the Badaling Great Wall Station.Completed in 2019, the station is a stone's throw away from the entrance to Badaling, the most popular section of the centuries-old wall. To protect the iconic monument from structural damage, the railway line and its accompanying station were built deep underground.  Related contentWhat's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? Preserving the Great Wall The Badaling Great Wall Station is the world's deepest high-speed railway station.Ren Chao/Xinhua/Getty ImagesBuried 102 meters (335 feet) below ground and covering an area of more than 36,000 square meters, the three-story structure is said to be the world's deepest and largest underground high-speed railway station.Constructing such a complex station, which includes a 12-kilometer-long  ​(7.45 miles) tunnel system, under a UNESCO World Heritage site was no easy feat. According to China's state media, engineers used an electronic detonator to precisely time the explosives down to the millisecond. It was the first time the technology was used in China, and allowed workers to maintain a vibration velocity of below 0.2 centimeters per second. That means every explosion was precisely calculated to ensure the impact would be no stronger than a single footstep on the Great Wall.Care was needed to ensure construction would not damage the Great Wall.AlamyStarting in 2016, construction of the tunnel and the station took around three years to complete.  The high-speed railway shortens the journey from China's capital city to the Badaling Great Wall from around 1.5 hours -- traffic congestion could make that time far longer -- to around 27 minutes.The station is a few minutes away from the Great Wall cable car station and around 800 meters (0.5 miles) from the starting point of the Badaling Great Wall. It's also home to China's second-longest escalator, stretching 88 meters long and 42 meters high. The Badaling Great Wall Station is part of the 108-mile-long Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway.Zhang Chenlin/Xinhua/Getty ImagesBecause of the distance to the train platform, the station gate is closed to ticket holders 12 minutes before the departure of the final train, instead of the usual five minutes in other stations in China, to ensure that the passengers have enough time to make their way through the massive station.Will the Great Wall be making an appearance at the Winter Olympics?While there won't be any Olympics sporting events taking place anywhere near the Badaling Great Wall, it will be part of the torch relay, taking place February 2-4. As a result the station, as well as the Badaling section of the wall, is closed on February 2 and 3. The Badaling station is 800 meters from the public entrance to the Great Wall. Ju Huanzong/Xinhua/Getty ImagesBadaling isn't the only portion of the Great Wall that will make an appearance on TV screens as part of the Winter Olympics ceremonies. Chongli district and Yanqing district, two areas with Winter Olympics villages, are also home to parts of the ancient barricade.Some tracks at the National Ski Jumping Centre in Chongli are as close as 20 meters to the Great Wall, offering a historic view for the skiers competing in the games.The Winter Olympics high-speed railwayOn one side, daily PCR tests, robots serving food, and isolated athletes. On the other, no access to the Olympic events for audiences or family members. CNN's Selina Wang and David Culver report from both sides of the Beijing Olympics bubble.The 108-mile-long Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway is served by a new high-speed electric multiple-unit (EMU) Fuxing train developed and operated by the state-owned China State Railway Group. Unveiled in early January, it can run up to 350 kilometers (or 217 miles) per hour and cuts travel time between two of the main Olympics host cities from three hours to 56 minutes. Though the high-speed train is autonomous, a monitoring driver is on board at all times. The train can automatically start, stop and adjust to the different speed limits between stations.The train's eight cars are equipped with 5G signals, intelligent lighting and 2,718 sensors to collect real-time data and detect any operational abnormalities.The new Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed train travels past the Juyongguan section of the Great Wall on January 25, 2022. Jia Tianyong/China News Service/Getty ImagesSpecial carriages were designed with the needs of athletes in mind. For instance, some cabins feature larger storage areas for winter sports equipment, which can be accessed by QR code. In addition to the main rail line, there are also two branches, Yanqing and Chongli, that connect authorized passengers to two key Winter Olympic villages. A 55-day closed-loop management system, which started from January 21, has been implemented so those heading to the Olympic Games do not share the same train carriages as other passengers on the line.

Get news about destinations opening and closing, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.(CNN) — New Zealand has announced it will begin reopening to the world, signaling an end to nearly two years of tough border rules that have separated families and shut out almost all foreigners.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern outlined a five-step plan Thursday that will allow fully vaccinated New Zealand citizens to start traveling from Australia later this month. They will need to self-isolate on arrival -- but they won't need to go into state-run quarantine facilities. By July, fully vaccinated people from Australia or visa waiver countries -- including the United Kingdom, the United States, and many European nations -- will be able to enter New Zealand and self-isolate on arrival, according to the plan. The government website states that ""self-isolation can be in your home or suitable alternative accommodation,"" so it's not yet known whether non-residents will be able to use hotels, rented apartments or other similar accommodations for their own self-isolation purposes.Related contentTravel to New Zealand during Covid-19: What you need to know before you goThe announcement is a major shift for New Zealand, which imposed some of the world's strictest border rules in a bid to shut out Covid-19.The country banned almost all foreign travelers in March 2020, and requires incoming visitors to spend time in a state-run quarantine facility at their own cost.To deal with the limited quarantine places, New Zealand brought in a quarantine lottery system which allowed citizens to enter an online queue at designated times in the hopes of scoring spots.Related contentJacinda Ardern in self-isolation as Covid cases rise in New ZealandThat has meant many New Zealanders have struggled to get home -- and some haven't seen their loved ones for years.The system has allowed New Zealand to keep Covid-19 numbers low, and just 53 Covid-19 deaths have been reported in the country, according to the country's Ministry of Health. But Ardern has been under increasing pressure to ease border rules and allow New Zealand to reunite with the world -- and to the estimated 1 million New Zealanders living overseas. Ardern said the anguish of quarantine had been ""heartbreaking.""""But the choice to use it, undeniably saved lives,"" she said, adding that the border rules had bought New Zealand time to become ""one of the most vaccinated countries in the world."" New Zealand has fully  vaccinated 93% of eligible people, according to the Ministry of Health. ""We are in a new phase in our Covid response,"" Ardern said. ""Covid as an illness hasn't touched many of us to date. But with the transmissibility of Omicron we know we will experience the virus more directly. But the difference here is that we have all the tools possible now to prepare."" Related contentThis artist is illustrating every place he visited during New Zealand lockdownNew Zealand's shift away from a zero-Covid approach has been signaled for months.In October, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country would begin to move away from a zero-Covid strategy toward living with the virus.

Like New Zealand, Australia imposed strict border rules to shut out Covid. Fully vaccinated citizens, visa holders and people from certain countries -- including New Zealand, Japan and Singapore -- are now able to travel to Australia without a travel exemption. "
travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/flying-small-vs-big-airplane-explainer-cmd/index.html,What is it like to fly on a small plane compared to a big plane?,,"(CNN) — What's the difference between flying on a small plane versus a large one, besides the price?Many misconceptions and preconceptions abound. Some people swear they only get airsickness on small planes, while others insist the on-board experience is more personalized.A small plane is one with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These planes, made by companies such as Cessna and Piper, can hold anywhere from 1-20 passengers.They're used for private aviation, but not exclusively. Some smaller planes can operate commercially on short routes or operate sightseeing flights. One example is the tourist flights that go over Peru's Nazca Lines -- most are operated on a 12-seat Cessna Grand Caravan, on which six people are lined along each side of the plane to guarantee everyone a window seat. Toni-Grace Bush, a flight instructor based in Brisbane, Australia, addresses some of the most common questions about flying on these aircraft.Related contentWhy does food taste different on planes?Are you more likely to get motion sickness on a small craft?In short -- yes.""Motion sickness is definitely more prevalent in general aviation because of how much more small craft feel pockets of air,"" Bush explains. ""[The] smaller craft that I fly around are below 5,000 feet, which is typically where a lot of the more volatile weather vectors can be."" She lists several of the most common causes of air queasiness: heat, loud noises and turbulence. The latter two are particularly prevalent on smaller planes.""It's much bumpier, and you do feel the turbulence more, especially during takeoff and landing."" Bush compares it to sailing: ""The faster the boat travels, the more it skims over the waves and the less turbulence it feels. It's the same with aircraft.""If you are more prone to motion sickness, go ahead and take your remedy of choice ahead of boarding -- even if you don't end up needing it, better safe than sorry.Bush has experience doing aerobatics, so she knows how to handle various levels of queasiness. She offers up these suggestions: ""Make sure you are well rested, have a little food in your tummy but not too much, and make sure you're hydrated.""Is there more freedom in terms of what you can bring on board?Not really. Smaller aircraft have weight limits, so you need to plan ahead and pack responsibly.You also need to follow the same rules you would if flying on a bigger jet.""A lot of the legislation airlines have to abide for what you can and can't access is still relevant on small aircraft,"" says Bush. For example, in her native Australia travelers must have permission to carry a firearm on any aircraft, regardless of size. Local laws still apply, so do your research first.There are also weight limits on board smaller planes. Travelers may have to step on the scale before boarding and have their baggage weighed as well. ""Travel as lightly as possible,"" Bush advises. ""if you have to travel with other personal belongings, then the pilot would have to sacrifice fuel to accommodate for that.""Related contentAirline etiquette in the not-so-friendly skiesWhy are small planes so loud?Small planes are loud for the same reason that its passengers are more likely to experience turbulence: There isn't as much space to absorb wind force and sound. Bush advises everyone on a small plane to have adequate ear protection, especially kids, whose ears are more sensitive. Some planes provide ear coverings, but it's never a bad idea to have your own handy.""Once you lose your hearing, you lose your hearing,"" she warns. Ear damage can be permanent, so plan ahead.Are small planes more dangerous?This is a common question, especially when attention is drawn to high-profile incidents involving public figures flying on board private planes.  But you should take a deep breath and try not to assume the worst.""There is always potential for an accident/incident to occur no matter what size the aircraft is,"" explains Bush. ""While there are more variables -- age (of the plane), condition of aircraft systems, experience of pilot, weather -- in general aviation aircraft that may lead to accidents/incidents in smaller aircraft ... the aviation industry is held to a high safety standard regardless of the size of the plane.""On planes, just like anywhere else, having knowledge and a sense of control will make you feel more at ease. According to data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), there are at most a few dozen commercial plane crashes per year in the United States. Between 2010 and 2021, there were a grand total of two fatalities on board commercial craft.Related contentHow risky is flying during a pandemic? What we know and how to make it saferIs it better to bring pets on smaller craft?You have probably seen headlines about the desperate people hiring private planes to ferry their pets out of places with strict quarantines and Covid lockdowns. Private and commercial aviation both have their pros and cons in this department.  If you can afford to fly animals on smaller specialty craft, it may be worth it just for your own peace of mind -- some high-end aviation companies, like VistaJet, have specially trained crew members on board who know how to work with animals and have taken pet CPR courses. Both will require a fair amount of paperwork, so you should keep up to date on shots and health visits, and get your pet a passport if needed. (Yep, that's a real thing.)Ask your vet for advice in advance. Some private plane companies have dedicated staff members who will walk you through the process -- from documentation to boarding -- as part of the cost of the ticket. "

travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/heathrow-landing-goaround-wind/index.html,Plane battling winds at Heathrow nearly topples over,,"(CNN) — As storms buffet the UK, footage has emerged of a pilot pulling off a particularly challenging landing -- but not before the plane appeared to nearly topple over and scrape its tail on the runway.British Airways flight 1307 traveled from Aberdeen to London on Monday -- but the 80-minute flight had a bumpy ride at the end. Coming in to land at Heathrow, the plane -- an Airbus A321neo -- was visibly buffeted by winds, before touching down on one wheel, bouncing up and down again, tipping precariously over to the left, and then appearing to knock the runway with the tail as the pilots aborted the landing and performed a go-around, taking off again in order to land safely. Jerry Dyer, who filmed the dramatic landing, told CNN that the event ""just goes to show how skilled pilots are."" A regular at Heathrow, where he films planes landing and taking off for his YouTube channel Big Jet TV, he had arrived only minutes earlier. Related contentThe world's best-selling airplanesAlthough the UK has been battered by the 90 mph winds of Storm Corrie, which have claimed two people's lives and left many without power, Dyer said the wind at Heathrow wasn't actually too bad -- he estimates around 20 mph -- but it was a gust funneling between two buildings and hitting the runway that nearly toppled the plane.Flight trackers show the plane reaching ground level at 140 mph just before midday, before steeply climbing to an altitude of 1,173 meters (3,850 feet) in four minutes.It landed for the second time 16 minutes later. It has not been confirmed whether the tail did actually strike the ground, or just seemed to.Dyer stayed three hours filming and saw one other plane do a go-around, as well as plenty struggling with the gusts. Go-arounds -- where the descending plane goes up again, to make another attempt -- and ""balked landings,"" where the pilot makes a go-around just as they're touching down, are perfectly safe. ""A balked landing is an easy, safe maneuver, and it's the thing to do whenever you think it's appropriate,"" Dann Runik, executive director of advanced programs at FlightSafety International, previously told CNN.Although that doesn't make them comfortable for those on board. Two of the passengers were members of the UK Parliament, traveling from their constituencies to the House of Commons, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson would later see his premiership take an equally visible buffeting. Richard Thomson, MP for Gordon, in northeast Scotland, told CNN that he owes the pilot ""deep gratitude for their professionalism and calm in how they dealt with what was a potentially very dangerous situation.""At first, everything seemed normal, he said.""While there was a harder than usual touchdown at first, it was when the plane came down for a second time that it appeared to be caught by a strong gust of wind. ""It was clear that the pilot had to decide quickly whether to try and steady the plane to make the landing or to abort. Fortunately, they were able to accelerate out of the situation to make a second approach. ""While it looked like the left wing was close to clipping the runway, it was only after seeing the video that we saw the tail had actually struck the runway,"" Thomson said.The plane even appeared to briefly strike the runway with its tail, before safely performing a go-around.Courtesy Big Jet TV""It didn't feel especially dramatic onboard and everyone stayed calm, but it's clear now how close we came to a serious incident.""Clearly we all noticed that we hadn't managed to land and felt the wind, but the skill of the pilot probably meant that it was only really those with a view on the left of the plane who were really able to tell how close to clipping the ground the wing was.""Dyer-- who rushes straight to Heathrow every time there's bad weather, often going viral with his videos -- told CNN he'd give the pilot ""10 out of 10"" for their ""split second decision.""Related contentWhen your plane touches down but doesn't land And he said that for avgeeks, watching planes in ""windy or stormy conditions"" is ""a lot more exciting"" than seeing them in normal conditions. ""It's the battle -- forces of nature against an alloy tube with wings on it that we have to control onto the ground,"" he said. ""It's a fantastic thing to watch.""He stayed for a further three hours, but didn't see anything as dramatic as the Aberdeen landing.A spokesperson for British Airways told CNN: ""Our pilots are highly trained to manage a range of scenarios, including extreme weather conditions, and our flight crew landed the aircraft safely. Our customers and crew all disembarked as normal.""And not only did they disembark normally, but they did so eight minutes ahead of schedule -- finally touching down at 12.17 p.m.Stephen Flynn, the other politician on the flight, tweeted afterwards: ""Can confirm this was not enjoyable.""

travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/british-airways-jet-transformed-into-party-plane/index.html,"Retired British Airways jet transformed into $1,300 per hour 'party plane'",,"(CNN) — There are many different places a retired plane can end up in its after life.Some return to the sky to fly for other airlines, others are recycled for parts (around 80 to 85% of an aircraft can be recycled) while a vast number are relocated to aircraft boneyards.One particular decommissioned British Airways jet is gearing up for a very action-packed future after being reborn as a unique events space for hire based at a UK airport.Suzannah Harvey, chief executive of the privately owned Cotswold Airport near Kemble in England, bought the Negus 747 for £1 (around $1.30) back in October 2020 and has spent 14 months or so converting it into a trendy ""party plane,"" with rates starting at about $1,300 an hour.Related contentThe man recreating airplane meals to get through lockdown'Party plane'Airport CEO Suzannah Harvey bought an iconic 747 British Airways jet and turned it into a events facility.@negus747/SWNSA vast number of 747s have been decommissioned as airlines bring forward retirement dates for older aircraft due to the pandemic, with KLM, Air France, Delta, United and British Airways all retiring their 747 fleets in the past two years.Harvey came up with the idea for the events facility as various retired BA 747s arrived at storage and parts company Air Salvage International, which happens to be located at Cotswold Airport, and promptly went to the UK flag carrier with her proposal.However, the process was far from simple. In fact, the sale involved weeks of negotiations during which BA agreed that the economy section of the plane could be removed and Harvey vowed to ensure that the aircraft would be well looked after.""It took six weeks to do the negotiations for the contract,"" Harvey tells CNN Travel. ""We have a duty of care to maintain her until it is uneconomically viable with any deterioration. But hopefully, she'll be with us for many years and generations to come.""According to Harvey, BA allowed Cotswold Airport to choose from its fleet of retired 747s, and they opted for an iconic Negus.Related content8 airplanes converted into restaurantsFull makeoverThe economy section has been completely stripped out, along with the ceiling panels and luggage compartments. @negus747/SWNS""I think it's the most beautiful one they've ever produced,"" she says.But it was once the team had signed on the dotted line that the hard work truly began. While much of the aircraft looks the same, including the livery and the cockpit, the economy section has been completely stripped out to create a party room and the galley has been restyled into a bar.In addition, the entire plane has been rewired with custom lighting in order to replicate the original onboard system while on the ground, as well as mains power.The ceiling panels in the economy section have been removed, along with the central luggage compartments, providing a better view of the inner workings of the aircraft, which first entered the British Airways fleet in February 1994, and took its last passenger flight on April 6, 2020.""It's been a lengthy process to actually make it safe for public viewing, because these aircraft are designed to be in the air,"" adds Harvey. ""So there are a lot of safety features which would not meet health and safety regulations for an event space on the ground. So they have to be decommissioned.""Related contentHow flying will change in 2022Labor of loveThe extensive makeover took over a year and cost around $671,000.@negus747/SWNSThe makeover has cost nearly £500,000 ($671,000). However, Harvey points out that around £200,000 ($268,000) of that was spent on putting in a new concrete pad, and £80,000 ($107,000) on rewiring costs.Although the work took far longer than expected, partly due to delivery issues as a result of the pandemic, the aircraft turned event space is finally ready to welcome guests. Its official launch will take place later this month.""We're absolutely inundated with inquiries at the moment,"" says Harvey. ""It's a very versatile events facility, so it can accommodate anything from a kid's birthday party, through to a new product launch or a corporate presentation.""Upcoming bookings include a filming commission for a TV show, as well as a number of parties. The aircraft can also be hired for weddings at a cost of £12,000 ($16,000) for 24-hours, which factors in set up and breakdown times, and the team already have a wedding booked in this spring.  ""The whole of the aircraft has a wedding license,"" explains Harvey.

The cost of transporting a plane of this size is also significant. ""We're in a very fortunate position,"" she admits. Although the space will be up and running shortly, there's still one unexpected issue that hasn't been completely ironed out yet.""One problem that we still haven't managed to solve is to get the toilet system working,"" she admits, before pointing out that airplane toilets are designed to work under pressurization when the aircraft is in altitude. ""We're hopeful that we'll nail that problem in the next six months or so. But at the moment, we've got very posh loo units that are positioned outside.""Although the process of converting the plane has been challenging and time-consuming, Harvey is extremely proud of the project and can't wait to start bringing revelers on board.""I think it's a real achievement,"" she says. ""I don't think anyone else has done such a versatile event space like this in the world. Now it's time for her to start earning her keep.""In addition to events, the airport will be opening up the facility for tours from March, and visitors will be able to book a place through a soon-to-launched app. Booking inquiries can also be made via Instagram."

Get news about destinations opening and closing, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.Hong Kong (CNN) — Dust off your pink, tiger-print jacket -- it's time to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Saying goodbye to the Ox, we enter the Year of the Tiger on February 1, 2022.  Though the pandemic continues to overshadow the occasion, with public festivities once again pared down or canceled in many cities, millions of families around the world will still be celebrating at home.  Here's a quick guide to the most common Lunar New Year traditions and superstitions, as well as insights from some of Hong Kong's most established geomancers on what the Year of the Tiger might have in store. Lunar New Year 101Lunar New Year festivities can often last for up to 15 days, with different tasks and activities taking place over that period. (In China, it's also referred to as the Spring Festival.)  Though the spread of Omicron has impacted the way people are celebrating this year, don't despair and remember the unofficial #1 tip from the Lunar New Year rule book: Focus on the positive and only use auspicious language. So how is the Lunar New Year traditionally celebrated? It all begins about a week ahead of the new year.On the 26th day of the last lunar month -- January 28 this year -- festive cakes and puddings are made. The word for cakes and puddings is ""gao"" in Mandarin or ""go"" in Cantonese, which sounds the same as the word for ""tall,"" meaning eating them is believed to lead to improvements and growth in the coming year.(If you haven't prepared your own ""go"" yet, here's an easy recipe for turnip cake, a beloved Lunar New Year dish.) Then, a big cleanup is done in homes on the 28th day, which was January 30 this year. The aim here is to rid your home of any bad luck that's accumulated over the past year.Red is the de facto Lunar New Year color. It's assoicated with luck and prosperity.Chen Chuhong/China News Service/Getty ImagesA big family reunion dinner is usually held on Lunar New Year's Eve, which falls on January 31 this year.The menu is carefully chosen to include dishes associated with luck, including fish (the Chinese word for it sounds like the word for ""surplus""), puddings (symbolizes advancement) and foods that look like gold ingots (like dumplings).Though many Western nations refer to the Lunar New Year/Spring Festival holiday as Chinese New Year, bear in mind it's celebrated not just in Chinese communities but in other Asian countries, including Vietnam and South Korea.Countries that observe Lunar New Year often offer three to seven days of public holidays but celebrations aren't complete until the 15th day of the first lunar month, also known as the Lantern Festival.  People are expected to visit relatives and friends in the early days of new year  -- except for the third day of the month. Day three of Lunar New Year (which falls on February 3 this year) is named ""chi kou,"" or red mouth. It's believed that arguments are more likely to happen on this day, so people will visit temples and avoid social interactions.Cities around the world welcome the Lunar New Year with lantern shows and fireworks.VCG/Getty ImagesThere are plenty of other rules and superstitions attached to the Lunar New Year. For instance, don't wash or cut your hair on the first day of the new year. Why? The Chinese character for hair is the first character in the word for prosper. Therefore washing or cutting it off is seen as washing your fortune away. You'll also want to avoid purchasing footwear for the entire lunar month, as the term for shoes (haai) sounds like losing and sighing in Cantonese.Do, however, wear red. It's associated with luck and prosperity. (Read more Lunar New Year dos and don'ts here.) Throughout the 15-day festival, hosts usually prepare candy boxes and snacks for their guests. Married couples are expected to hand out red packets filled with money to children and unmarried adults to wish them luck.Related contentLunar New Year dos and don'tsThe seventh day (February 7) is said to be the day when the Chinese mother goddess Nuwa created mankind and, thus, is called renri (the people's birthday).Different communities in Asia will serve different birthday foods on that day. For instance, people in Malaysia enjoy yeesang, or a ""Prosperity Toss"" of raw fish and shredded vegetables, whereas Cantonese people will eat sweet rice balls.The highlight comes on the last day (February 15). In ancient Chinese society, it was the only day when young girls could go out to admire lanterns and meet boys. Thus, it's also been dubbed Chinese Valentine's Day.Nowadays, cities around the world still put on massive lantern displays and fairs on the final day of the festival. Heavenly stems and earthly branchesThe 12-year Chinese zodiac calendar cycle is represented by 12 different animals -- the Chinese zodiac signs -- but that's only the start. Followers believe that for each of the Chinese zodiac signs, luck will depend largely on the positions of the Tai Sui -- the stars directly opposite Jupiter.If your zodiac sign clashes with Tai Sui -- aka the Grand Duke of Jupiter -- in a particular year, the experts say you might find yourself dealing with disruptions. (Find your sign here.)A year isn't just categorized by its zodiac animal. There's also a complex sexagenary cycle made up of 10 heavenly stems and  12 earthly branches.Every year, a heavenly stem (one of five elements, which fall into either the yin or yang category) is paired with an earthly branch (one of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac).So February 1 marks the beginning of ""Ren Yin"" year, the 39th element of the Chinese sexagenary cycle. The Tiger -- ""Yin"" -- is paired with the heavenly stem ""Ren"" -- water. So it's referred to as the Year of the Water Tiger.Confused yet? We asked some of Hong Kong's most established geomancy consultants to help explain what it all means. The world will welcome the Year of the Tiger on February 1, 2022.VCG/Getty Images""Water Tiger is the name of the year but don't be mistaken -- wood and fire elements are much more prominent than water this year,""  Hong Kong geomancy consultant So Man-fung Peter tells CNN Travel. ""How the year affects you depends on what elements you need and fear according to your birth chart.""A 60-year calendar is often used to calculate how each person's birth sign will be affected in a particular year. In Chinese geomancy, one's birthday chart is composed of a wide range of elements that interact with the year's heavenly and earthly stems. So for many, the calendar plays an important role in making huge life decisions for the year ahead, such as whether they should get married or start a business.Related contentThe meanings behind Lunar New Year's 'fortune' candies Because these birthday charts are composed of a wide range of elements such as the day and time of their birth, they may interact with the year a bit differently.But ""there is some general guidance we could follow,"" says So. ""Most people born in autumn and winter (August 8 to March 6) generally need more wood and fire; they will see an improvement in their fortune from 2022. (Those dates apply to those in the Southern Hemisphere as well, even though the seasons are different.)""Fire also signifies clashes like car accidents. So if you're clashing with Tai Sui this year, you would want to be extra careful when you drive,"" says So.  Thierry Chow, another well-known Hong Kong geomancy consultant, agrees that road accidents are a concern given this year's prevailing elements. But she thinks that water will still play a vibrant role in 2022.""So we can expect big movements for anything water-related, which unfortunately could mean more water-related disasters, or big ocean movements,"" she tells CNN. ""On a more positive note, the Water Tiger year also represents strength in the arts, technology and design sector, which means these areas will be thriving.""Which animals will have a good year?Different geomancy masters may interpret the data differently, but there is a general consensus on what the year means for each zodiac animal based on the positions of the stars, especially Tai Sui.As noted above, if your zodiac sign clashes with Tai Sui in a particular year, you might find yourself dealing with disruptions.Born in the year of the Tiger? It's your ""Ben Ming Nian.""  Xu Hongxing/VCG/Getty ImagesPeople born in the Year of the Tiger will be facing their ""Ben Ming Nian"" -- their own zodiac year -- in 2022. Followers believe this means there will be more disruptions and instabilities in the year to come.""Your financial luck isn't too bad this year but you may be overshadowed by negative emotions. So it's better if you focus on your work and boost your wealth this year. If you're a winter baby, you could try to advance at work,"" says So of what lies ahead for the world's Tigers. ""Be very careful when you drive, especially in first lunar month.""A few other zodiac signs will also be clashing with Tai Sui in various ways, including Monkeys. Similar to Tigers, they may deal with challenges in relationships and unexpected changes. ""If you're born in spring or summer, you may want to reconsider making bold career moves this year,"" says So. ""But if you're single, the clash may bring you some luck in love.""People born in the year of the Snake will also be conflicting with Tai Sui this year, which may lead to an increase in gossip and annoyances.Related content20 of the world's best soups""Among all the signs, I think Snakes should be most careful this year. 'Ying Tai Sui' usually translates to tricky problems involving legal documents -- problems that may not go away easily. If you really need to sign any document this year, you'll need to be immensely thorough,"" says So.Meanwhile, Pigs are in only in a slightly conflicting position with Tai Sui. They could find themselves arguing with friends, but So thinks that a lucky star will bring Pigs some helpful benefactors. ""There is a lucky star shining above Pigs this year. We call it 'luk hap' (the unity of six directions -- everything aligns with the universe in a harmonious way) so it's actually a pretty good year for them.""Clashing with Tai Sui is not as scary as it sounds. Followers believe there are ways to improve your luck.""Traditionally people always think that change or instability is bad but it can actually be a good thing and a chance for you to grow a lot. It's not about fighting the change but embracing it,"" says Chow. ""I encourage people to attend happy events. There's a saying...if you have one happy event, it will counteract and balance out the negative energy of three events."" She says getting married, attending parties or anything that could bring you joy would lessen the blow.On the other hand, people born in the year of the Horse will be matching with Tai Sui, ""which means that they will enjoy great relationships despite facing some gossip. They may enjoy an improvement in power, status and wealth,"" says So.As for the rest of the animals, So says Goats and Oxes will enjoy much better luck in romance and at work this year compared to 2021.People born in the year of the Rabbit could see romantic relationships easily come and go.If you are born in the year of Dog, it could be a positive year for two types of people: those with works connected to foreign lands and those who are artists, says So.And finally, Roosters could find themselves meeting people who will help them in 2022, while Rats and Dragons don't have any significant lucky or unlucky stars shining above them and will have a relatively peaceful year.As we say in Hong Kong, sun nien fai lok!

travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/jodi-ettenberg-legal-nomads-csf-leaks-wellness-cmd/index.html,"A spinal fluid leak derailed my life of travel and food, but taught me to find beauty in the small things",,"(CNN) — During any life-changing event, there comes a moment when the fog of the crisis temporarily clears, and you realize with certainty that things will never be the same again.That moment gets a lot of airtime in books and movies, often as a pivotal, middle-of-the-night epiphany in a protagonist's narrative arc. Sticking to the stereotype, that moment came for me at 5 a.m., on a morning about two months after I was left incapacitated by a lumbar puncture. That was the instant that I realized I would likely never return to the life I'd worked so hard to build. By then, I had spent almost a decade as an accidental entrepreneur, growing a business I loved centered around food and exploration. I quit my job as a lawyer in 2008, leaving for what I thought would be a one-year trip around the world. I planned to return to the legal field once that adventure ended.I didn't travel to reject societal norms; I simply wanted to experience life in an unconventional way. Even so, I discovered that travel returned perspective to me, something I had not realized I had lost during my years of corporate work. Before I embarked on my career as a lawyer, I found it easy to put myself in someone else's shoes and offer them grace. With 90-hour work weeks, I forgot some of those life skills. I became more negative in my thinking, quicker to complain. Slowly exploring the world helped me recalibrate. I came back to the person I used to be.  Related contentI moved to Asia, got cancer, and then coronavirus happenedBack then, there were few long-term travelers documenting their trips online. I shared the experiences of coming back to myself through my travels with family, friends and former clients on my website, Legal Nomads. It grew an audience quickly and received early press coverage, which propelled me into an unexpected career journey. I kept the site ad-free and instead focused on long-form writing and creating resources that my readers asked for, which provided me with an income. In turn, I gained a thriving community of people who were not only interested in travel and food, but also storytelling, curiosity and personal growth.Then, in 2017, it all ended with a medical procedure gone wrong.Incapacitated overnightI hadn't heard of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak when I underwent the procedure that gave me one. After eight years of eating and writing my way through South Asia and Mexico, I spent the summer in New York house-sitting for friends. At that time, I was developing guides devoted to gluten-free dining for fellow celiacs, settling into a home base in Oaxaca, Mexico and feeding my readers from there, while working on freelance and public speaking projects that excited me. While in the US, I developed symptoms that landed me in the hospital, where doctors recommended a lumbar puncture to rule out specific conditions.Prior to the procedure, I was informed that I may have a headache that would dissipate after a few days of rest. The lumbar puncture did not go smoothly, with multiple attempts needed in order to access my CSF.Writer Jodi Ettenberg, standing in front of the Treasury in UNESCO-listed Petra, Jordan in 2011. Jodi Ettenberg/Legal NomadsImmediately following the procedure, I could barely walk. My legs were jelly, while at the same time it felt like someone had poured concrete into my lower spine. Within days, I could not stand up. My brain felt like it was sagging in my head, as if it were an anvil pushing down into my neck. When in bed, the room spun. I felt too nauseous to eat, and had trouble finding words. My back burned uncontrollably from top to bottom. Together, these symptoms rose to a level of pain that left me reeling.As I shared my confusion and fear with my Legal Nomads community, readers who had suffered post-puncture complications themselves pointed me in the right direction. They suggested it might be a spinal CSF leak caused by the procedure. CSF surrounds the brain and spinal cord, and is contained by a connective tissue membrane called the dura mater. A hole or tear in the dura, such as one caused by a lumbar puncture, allows the CSF that cushions those organs to escape. If the hole does not heal, it can lead to a myriad of painful symptoms when a patient is upright, among them the positional head pain that I experienced.Searching for careWith plans to return to my apartment in Oaxaca off the table for what I thought would be a few weeks while I healed, I learned that my best next step was to have a procedure called an epidural blood patch, which would attempt to seal the leak. Despite the straightforward narrative that I was incapacitated following a lumbar puncture and had none of these symptoms prior, I was denied a blood patch at the hospital that performed the procedure. They told me that my symptoms would abate on their own. Later, after my parents retrieved me in the US and carefully drove me back to my hometown in Canada, I was rejected again. The hospital treated me for a migraine instead. Unable to stand, I laid in bed in Canada in the months following my lumbar puncture feeling defeated. With no treatment options offered to me in the US or Canada, I dove into research studies and considered how to advocate for my next steps.My community stepped up too. Friends launched a crowdfunding campaign to help support me as I searched for answers, others introduced me to additional patients who had suffered CSF leaks. Those patients told me about the handful of specialized centers treating the condition, and urged me to seek care with one of them, the interventional neuroradiology team at Duke Health.Thankfully, they accepted my case.A descent into griefVietnam, in 2015. Jodi Ettenberg/Legal NomadsWith the soonest available appointments at Duke months out, I descended into some of my most difficult weeks since the procedure. Physically, I was in a haze of discomfort. It felt like I had been zipped into someone else's skin and my body was no longer my own. My only relief was lying flat. Mentally, I grappled with being so dependent on my parents after decades of self-sufficiency. I couldn't perform basic human functions that had been second-nature to me, like getting dressed or putting on socks.I swung between anger at being confined to bed, and denial about my potential prognosis. The nights that I could sleep, I dreamed of my apartment in Oaxaca and my ebbing hope that I would get back there one day. The more I read about complicated lumbar punctures and subsequent spinal CSF leaks, the less likely it seemed that I would return to my old life.It was then that the 5 a.m. epiphany hit me, and I sunk into grief.Road tripping to North Carolina""I often described my bedbound state to friends as feeling like a puppy looking out the window as people played outside,"" says Ettenberg, seen here visiting an alpaca farm in Akaroa, New Zealand in 2014.  Jodi Ettenberg/Legal NomadsWhen I finally got to Duke, I had four rounds of epidural blood patching, where my doctor injected patches of blood and fibrin glue around my lumbar spine. The fourth patch sealed my leak, but I reacted to the fibrin glue and went into anaphylactic shock, requiring an epinephrine injection at the end of the procedure.  Recovery was lengthy, and it took weeks before I even knew whether the patch was successful. I slowly progressed from bedrest, to standing, to walking, with my community of readers cheering me on as I shared my progress. The leak specialists said it was unlikely that I would be able to return to my prior adventures given my facts, but they hoped that I could lead an upright life that included travel with restrictions. I was hopeful, too.Nearly a year after the lumbar puncture, I was able to walk many miles a day, including a triumphant scramble up Montreal's Mount Royal for my birthday.Related contentSent home in stitches: 20 years ago, a motorbike accident put an end to my Thailand adventures But then, a month later, everything fell apart. I sat down cross-legged on the ground and felt pain lance across the leak site. I don't know whether I stretched too far, or twisted the wrong way, but whatever it was, it was enough to undo eight long, hard months of rebuilding. After being so careful about my movements, it was a shock that such a non-event could so thoroughly unravel my healing.I felt my symptoms come back one by one, the telltale ""brain sag"" among them. I returned to lying flat again, realizing that even a life of modified travel was likely beyond my reach. Processing the unfairness of it allWhen things fall apart, we get stuck in the grievance of the moment. It's maddening that some people have to shoulder more hardship than others in life. It's infuriating that life just isn't fair.For many months after I re-leaked, I was caught in that state of listless despair. As a former lawyer, I am an expert catastrophizer. I had much to stress about, which gifted me ample material from which to craft robust worst-case scenarios. It wasn't helpful for my healing, but that didn't stop me from indulging in anger and fear and letting it corrode me from the inside. Back in bed again after the writer's spinal CSF leak re-opened in late September 2018.Courtesy Jodi Ettenberg/Legal NomadsWell-meaning people sent me Instagram posts about how positive thinking would help my healing. I read books about happiness, and about how daily affirmations could make me feel better. Yet every word I consumed made me feel more alone. Toxic positivity promises that gratitude is all you need. Losing my mobility taught me otherwise. Feeling general appreciation or gratitude does not fix everything when life unspools. Worse, when illness is involved, the insistence on gratitude can be alienating, and even cause harm. Patients feel castigated for not being ""grateful enough."" Gratitude is an effective tool, one among many, when nurtured as a skill. It is not a panacea for pain. And when we jump straight to gratitude without first sitting in the mess of our present, we skip a very important step.I learned that what I needed initially was to process my anger and my loss. Striving to find beauty when I was in the thick of grief was akin to spiritual bypassing, thwarting my progress by camouflaging the mess. It was as if I were trying to pave over a pothole without first filling it in. The mess was still there.I found a grief therapist with experience in chronic pain, who helped me understand that my feelings of isolation and anger were normal. Through therapy, I came to terms with the maelstrom of my emotions, and moved through them to a more accepting place.Only then was I able to reframe each moment as a choice. I had to let beauty fill me up, instead of rage and grief. Reframing the grievance of the momentMy travels helped me regain perspective after years of lawyering, but this leak journey put that viewpoint to the test. I thought that I was already appreciative of the small things in life, but that was not enough. In the thick of it, I had to actively choose how I wanted to wake up each day, and who I wanted to be.At first, this intentional choice felt like a flavor of denial. Western society encourages a lot of all-or-nothing thinking, and I unconsciously mirrored that pattern in my own beliefs. Things could either be terrible, or they could be magical. That heuristic sets us up for a lot of disappointment, because the ""either or"" is not life. Life is all things together, at the same time. Life is simultaneously very beautiful, and very hard.I realized, then, that reframing things doesn't detract from the inequity of it all, or mean that I've given up on trying to seal my leak. I am in pain, yes, but I can allow myself to also feel joy again, moment to moment, amid the messiness. It no longer felt like a conflict to feel awful while also encountering wonder throughout my day. Related contentI was stolen from, beaten up and swindled -- it was the best trip everEach setback became an opportunity to practice that reassessment of the moment, and train my mind away from the negative. When I catastrophized, I acknowledged the unfairness -- but instead of dwelling on it, I actively shifted my focus to community, to nature, to the simple joys of sipping tea.Throughout, I kept up with my therapy sessions, grieving my losses while also celebrating the choices that allowed me to revel in life's small joys that I found. Over time, thousands and thousands of these tiny joys strung together to light up my life in surprising ways. The result was something I never thought possible: the reframe became second nature.This duality -- an attention to granular details alongside the hard work of processing tragedy -- provided me with a way through the melancholy of these last years. Pandemic isolation was my norm""I do get a few hours of 'upright' time a day,"" says Ettenberg, seen here out for a walk in the summer of 2021 in Gatineau, Quebec. Courtesy Jodi Ettenberg/Legal NomadsI often described my bedbound state to friends as feeling like a puppy looking out the window as people played outside. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the wider world got a taste of that isolation, and the mental toll that it can take. Like me a few years prior, nearly everyone had to stop not only their travels, but also many daily activities that they previously took for granted. And many people were largely cut off from physical contact outside their households. The collective grief that ensued highlighted how hard it is for anyone to be alone in the darkness. It takes effort to ask for help, or to reach out to others when feeling depressed. It takes a willingness to be vulnerable, to share the anxieties that arise when the world becomes smaller. But doing so alleviates some of the burden that comes with relearning what it means to be human in a new landscape.I recognized a lot of my mental struggles reflected back at me during the pandemic. Conversely, my community messaged to say that they understood more of the heartache I processed during my journey. Though some of the world is opening back up, I will still be in bed. My challenge is to maintain my focus on the beauty of the small, not the larger things I cannot participate in. An uncertain future""My travels helped me regain perspective after years of lawyering, but this leak journey put that viewpoint to the test,"" says Ettenberg.  Courtesy Jodi Ettenberg/Legal NomadsWill I ever be sealed again? I don't know. During this leak journey, specialists confirmed that I have two genetic conditions that complicate my prognosis, one affecting the immune system, called Mast Cell Activation Disorder, and the other a heritable connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. I had not heard of these conditions prior to my lumbar puncture, and only since researching each one do I better understand how small, seemingly unrelated symptoms actually had common root causes. I have met patients with these conditions who have been trying to get sealed for many years, waiting for science to catch up with their needs.Despite my complicated case, I hope to be able to return to Duke for another patch eventually.These days, I am managing my symptoms as best I can. I am very limited physically, and my leak symptoms persist. I do get a few hours of ""upright"" time a day, likely due to my body overcompensating by producing extra CSF. Whereas I used to explore countries and new foods, my days are now filled with internal exploration. An adventure of the mind, one that I also share with my online community, providing a different journey for us to undertake together.My 5 a.m. moment was prescient after all. My life has not been the same. In all the messiness, I've learned to muddle through terrible times. Choosing possibility. Choosing hope. Choosing to celebrate the joy in the small, every single day. If you had told me years ago that I'd be finding beauty in anything when I couldn't tie my own shoes, I'd have laughed in your face.But we're all more adaptable than we think. Somehow, even me.

travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed/index.html,What should I do if my flight has been canceled or delayed?,,"(CNN) — It has been a tough slog for some air travelers ever since the winter holidays rush.Between the spike Omicron variant cases causing staffing shortages and bad winter weather, airlines have been canceling and delaying thousands of flights since December 23. This week, you can blame it on the weather again.CNN Business reports that US airlines canceled thousands of flights Thursday because of a massive winter storm.What if you're one of the unlucky passengers caught up in this? Here are some tips to help travelers navigate the system when flights are delayed or canceled whether by staff shortages, weather or other issues:Avoid getting trapped at the airportAs bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it's better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room and make new arrangements from there.""Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,"" said Scott Keyes, the founder of Scott's Cheap Flights. ""Save yourself the drive to the airport."" Keyes told CNN Travel in an interview late last year that you should sign up for airlines' free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. You should also download your carrier's app.You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way. That's also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up.Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across country.If you're at the airport alreadyA flight information display system shows departure times at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on Monday, December 27.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesSometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you've arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do?Keyes said to head fast as you can to the airline agents' desk -- and get ready to multitask while you're in line.Fast is a key word here. ""It's going to make a difference who arrives first. It's first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,"" Keyes said.Then call up your carrier while you're waiting. Depending on your spot in line, it might be faster to get through to a call center. ""Whatever happens first, great,"" he said.Calls to US domestic numbers might have really long waits. Keyes suggested trying an international call center for your carrier instead.""Most US-based travelers aren't thinking to call the Canadian help line for Delta. You might get through to an agent much quicker. They can all handle your reservations just the same.""You can also use a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines says. ""Scan your boarding pass or enter your record locator to see your updated trip details. From there you can also switch your flight and print your new boarding passes.""Attitude and research matterPassengers wait in line to check in for their flights at the Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, on Monday, December 27. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Whether you're dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference. That starts with attitude.""Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,"" Keyes said. ""Look at this from the airline agents' perspective. They've been dealing with irate customers really since the pandemic began. The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you.""Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.""He had another tip when it's your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: ""Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.""Related contentCities that are canceling their big New Year's Eve events -- and those still going forwardYour agent can expedite things if you've already looked up new routes and possible suggestions while you've been waiting. Be ready to explain what you want.If you've booked through Expedia or another third-party site, you'll have to deal through them when there's a cancellation.If price is the same, Keyes suggested you book directly with the airline. In case something goes wrong, ""it makes it much more complicated with multiple sets of policies"" when you booked via a third party.US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, suggests you avoid layovers when booking if possible. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong.The group also backs up the advice from Keyes to be nice and polite to agents but also says consumers should be persistent in trying to get the situation resolved satisfactorily. Trapped for the nightA woman and child wait for their flight alongside another traveler at Miami International Airport on Monday, December 27.Rebecca Blackwell/APWhat do you do if it looks like you're not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you're not in your home city?""Ask the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It's not required by law,"" Keyes said. They're less likely to do it if it's weather related, he said, than if the problem is a mechanical issue with the plane or staffing issues.What you might get depends on the airline itself and the specific circumstances on why a flight was canceled. Related contentHere's how you can jump the TSA line for free at certain airportsGet to know policies. For instance, Delta Air Lines says it will provide a hotel voucher in some circumstances if travel is interrupted for more than four hours after the scheduled departure time when the delay is between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Whatever you do, at least ask, Keyes said. A voucher for hotels and even ground transport and meals aren't likely to just be offered.You should also look up your credit card information. Keyes said your card might have passenger protections, including free hotel rooms if you're stranded and perhaps even cover your food and taxi to the hotel. Look up what do you need to do to get reimbursed.If your flight is delayed instead of outright canceled, you might want to weigh whether to wait at the airport. Depending your personal circumstances, hunkering down there for five or six hours might be easier than going to and from a hotel. Also, Keyes said, check whether there is a hotel within the airport.The Points Guy advises trying to get into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily.Cancel your trip and fly later""If you are scheduled to fly ... and worried about Omicron, airlines are offering free changes to your flight,"" Keyes said. ""If you'd like to switch your travel dates, you can change without penalty.""He also noted that if the new travel dates are cheaper, you can get a travel credit. (Conversely, you'll pay more if the flight is more expensive.)Refund entitlements for your flightThe US Department of Transportation says you are entitled to a refund of your ticket cost because of a cancellation or ""significant delay"" and you choose not to travel.This is the policy regardless of the reason the airlines cancels or delays the flight. However, what ""significant delay"" remains open to interpretation. According to the DOT website, ""it has not specifically defined what constitutes a 'significant delay.'  Whether you are entitled to a refund depends on many factors -- including the length of the delay, the length of the flight, and your particular circumstances.  DOT determines whether you are entitled to a refund following a significant delay on a case-by-case basis.""CNN's Gregory Wallace, Jordan Valinsky, Chris Liakos and Sonnet Swire contributed to this report."

travel,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/pen-pal-message-in-a-bottle-friendship/index.html,A 50-year pen pal friendship that began with a message in a bottle,,"(CNN) — Robbinroger Beever was 15 years old and walking home along a beach in Liberia, West Africa. The year was 1967. Beever's family lived near Monrovia, where his diplomat father worked at the US Embassy.It was high tide and the sea had washed up seaweed and planks of wood and strewn them across the beach. Amid the debris, Beever spotted something glistening in the late afternoon sun.""I'm the type of person who's very curious about what the ocean can bring to people who have their eyes open,"" he tells CNN Travel.Beever got closer. It was a whiskey bottle. Picking it up, he could see something coiled inside. He tried to open the bottle, unsuccessfully. It's probably just some kind of label, Beever thought, but decided to take it home anyway.Back home, he showed the discovery to his mother. They put it on the dining room table and after a bit of effort they managed to prise the cap open.The something inside wasn't a label. It was a letter -- a message in a bottle.Beever uncoiled the sheet of paper, and started to read:""I threw this bottle off a merchant marine ship passing over the Equator near central Africa,"" it read. ""My name is Gösta Mårtensson, I am Swedish merchant marine.""The letter was dated from 1965. Mårtensson had included a return address for his home in in Gothenburg, Sweden.Beever enthusiastically wrote back, introducing himself: an American teenager, one of two sons of a British-American father and an Austro-Hungarian-Dalmation mother from Trieste, Italy. He told Mårtensson the story of how he'd stumbled across the bottle.Mårtensson was thrilled his letter had found its way to a recipient, but he was in his late 20s. I'm not the ideal pen pal for a 15-year-old, he thought.But he had an idea: he'd introduce this young letter writer to his wife's sister, Saija Kuparinen. Kuparinen, 14, lived in Finland. She'd had no idea her brother-in-law had thrown a bottle off a ship near the Equator, but upon hearing the story she was eager to write to the boy in Liberia.Kuparinen wasn't confident writing in English, so she composed a message in German, writing about her school, friends, family and life in Finland.She hoped she'd get a response, but her letter traveling across the world felt like a longshot. But it wasn't. Beever got her letter and was delighted. He loved the idea of communicating with a girl in Finland.He scrawled a response, and a connection was formed. Five decades later, the pair are still in touch, not only pen pals but close friends who've watched each other grow up from afar.Today, Kuparinen lives with her family in Finland, while Beever, who's spent time in countries across the globe, now lives with his wife and sons in Germany.""Our friendship never stopped, even when I had my life with my daughter and husband,"" Kuparinen tells CNN Travel.""We have been corresponding for almost 55 years -- from being giggly teenagers to older responsible adults,"" says Beever. ""I felt really, really connected to her.""A globe-spanning friendshipBeever was 15 when he first started writing to Kuparinen. Here's his Liberia ID card from the time.Courtesy Robbinroger BeeverGrowing up, Beever's family were never in one place for long. Following the three-year stint in Liberia, the family moved back to Washington, DC for a year. For a while, Beever's letters to Kuparinen came with a US post stamp.He wrote in English, and, at first, she always wrote back in German.Then his father started working for the US Agency for International Development and was dispatched to Vietnam to work as an advisor during the war. His wife and sons based themselves in Taipei to remain a safe distance from the conflict.Beever wrote to Kuparinen about his growing love of Taiwan, especially the folk art tradition. He also wrote candidly about his worries for the future.  ""We were growing up. We don't know what direction our lives will go in. The Vietnam War was raging,"" he says. ""I always felt I could write to her. I had never met her, but I felt there was a kind of spiritual connection between us.""Saija Kuparinen was also in her teens when the two friends first started writing to each other.Courtesy Saija KuparinenRelated contentThey met on an airplane to Egypt then fell in loveBeever began traveling back and forth to Vietnam to visit his father, and he wrote to Kuparinen about what he saw.""Some of the experiences were beautiful,"" he says. ""Others were horrendous, especially when I saw American soldiers, who were my age, fighting a war against people they didn't understand, in the country they had very little information about.""At 18, Beever had to register for the draft. Some of his American friends served, but his number was never called up. He was relieved.Among these more serious musings, Beever and Kuparinen had also bonded over a love of rock music.They were both fans of The Rolling Stones and The Mamas & the Papas. The pen pals started to speak on the phone on occasion. One of them would play a record through the receiver, and they'd dance together -- separated by oceans and thousands of miles.Already, Kuparinen had become a constant in Beever's life. He'd always made friends easily but moving from place to place meant retaining those relationships was hard.Beever also spent time in Vietnam as a teenager.Courtesy Robbinroger BeeverAnd for Kuparinen, receiving dispatches from countries she'd never been to was fascinating.""Of course, in my youth others had pen pals too, but not the kind [like] Robbie, who was moving from one country to another,"" she says.Kuparinen always tried to make her responses creative and interesting. She used to make envelopes from pages she'd torn from fashion and nature magazines.Receiving these, and seeing the care and attention behind them, was a thrill for Beever.""Then I knew she really liked me, even though we had never met,"" he says.

Their lives continued to move on, but the correspondence continued. When Beever met new people and told them about his friendship with Kuparinen, he referred to her as one of his best friends.He reckons the physical distance between them helped the emotional closeness.“I always felt I could write to her. I had never met her, but I felt there was a kind of spiritual connection between us.”Robbinroger Beever""It gave me reflection time when I was writing,"" he says.""Sometimes she asked me very deep philosophical questions: Where do you think you will be in 10 years? Are you married yet? What are you doing now? Do you still have wanderlust? When are you coming to Finland to visit us, we've been writing for so long?""With the dawn of the internet age, the duo began interspersing their snail mail with emails. Sending links to music they loved was easier, and attaching photographs was a bonus.And a long-awaited in-person meeting was finally planned.

She greeted him with her husband and daughter in tow.At first it was surreal -- none of them was quite sure what to say. They introduced themselves. Rather formally, the pen pals shook hands.""I'm Rob,"" he said. ""I'm Saija,"" she replied.They got in the car and drove to Kuparinen's home. ""She invited me in, and she said, 'Rob, I'm happy you're here,'"" recalls Beever. ""We had some coffee and some cake, and things got much better after that.""As for Kuparinen, she says she truly didn't believe Beever would actually visit until she saw him in person.It wasn't that she didn't trust his word, it's just the meeting was so long anticipated that it was hard to believe it was finally occurring.Talking in person turned out to be just as natural as their years communicating by mail.""It was like we had [been] speaking all the time,"" she says. ""We were so special friends. We just continued in real life.""The visit was characterized by walks along the coast, searching for the midnight sun and long chats over hot coffee.Kuparinen's daughter and her husband quickly fell into an easy camaraderie with Beever too, cooking him a traditional Finnish meal and showing him how to enjoy a Finnish sauna.""We all liked this big American man a lot!"" says Kuparinen.""it was a very nice time together, I could feel the positive energy,"" says Beever.After the visit came to an end, Beever said his goodbyes. Back home, he got a call from Kuparinen.He'd accidentally left behind a sweater.She said, ""Let me keep it here, so you have to come back.""Over a decade later, Beever visited Kuparinen for the second time. More time had passed, he was married with two twin boys. His family came along too. It was a different experience, but just as special. ""We all got along very well together and that was lovely,"" says Beever. ""We went mushroom picking, we went berry picking.""At the end of the day, the families would unwind with a Finnish beer, reflecting on their lives and Beever and Kuparinen's friendship.Related contentHe flew to Paris to surprise his girlfriend.

And also, the realization that there's more behind us than in front of us. So, live for the moment, and share your love with your family and friends and really show them that.""""I often think about our history,"" says Kuparinen.She doesn't have all her letters anymore -- some have got lost along the way.

This midflight labor happened on United Airlines Flight 997, which departed from Kotoka International Airport in Accra, the capital of Ghana, and was bound for Washington Dulles International Airport on an 11-hour flight.They had been in the air for roughly six hours when the woman went into labor, United Airlines told CNN Travel in an email on Monday evening.Luckily for the mother, a physician, a nurse and United flight attendant who is a former nurse were onboard the Boeing 787-8 aircraft ready to assist.""Our crew was amazing,"" United wrote in a statement to CNN Travel. ""They acted quickly, assisted the medical professionals onboard and ensured everyone stayed safe throughout the flight.

She was returning from a three-week trip to Ghana, where she visited the Genesis Shishidzee school in Jamestown, an older neighborhood in Accra, to help the children there.She told CNN Travel she was in business class, and the woman who gave birth was in the row behind her, though they were separated by the emergency exits. That meant that the laboring woman had space in front of her seat to lie down.""I was asleep. ... I thought I was dreaming when I heard moaning. I got out of my seat, and I saw someone on the ground. A nurse was over her,"" Warren said.It took Warren a minute to fully realize what was happening. When she did, ""I thought, 'Oh God, I know she is not about to give birth on this plane. I was literally counting her contractions -- seven to 10 minutes apart. I was, like, freaking out. Oh, my God.""""Then the doctor started working on her. They brought out an IV to put in her,"" Warren said. ""She was moaning and yelling, but half the people on the plane didn't know what was going on.""Adding to the tension: The plane encountered turbulence during parts of the flight, Warren said.""I just started praying over her out loud as she was starting to push.

technology,http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/tech/how-to-spot-fake-misleading-news-trnd/index.html,Here's how to outsmart fake news in your Facebook feed,"By AJ Willingham, CNN"," (CNN)Just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true. It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn't have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn't breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit. It doesn't have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot -- if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis, the head of the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute.  First, know the different types of misleading and false news1. Fake newsThese are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real. 2. Misleading news These are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren't supported by the information in the article. 3. Highly partisan news A type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda. 4. Clickbait The shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information -- which may or may not live up to what was promised. 5. Satire This one is tough, because satire doesn't pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate. Second, hone your fact-checking skills Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it's important to have a ""healthy amount of skepticism"" and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news. ""If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we'd go a good way towards combating flasehoods,"" he told CNN. Melissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren't immune to fake content. ""People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,"" she told CNN. ""I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn't necessarily mean you're internet savvy.""For starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake:1. Does the story come from a strange URL?     Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like "".co"" or "".su,"" or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales. Read More2. Does the headline match the information in the article?      Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don't bother to click through. Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. ""Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to 'Take Their Business Elsewhere',"" trumpeted one such headline. However, the articles themselves didn't contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi's stock saw a significant drop (it didn't). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump's election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to ""take their business elsewhere.""3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed?      Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney. A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump's election win. The story quickly caught fire online -- after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry. It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio -- in 2015.  It had nothing to do with the election results at all. 4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable?      Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. ""IT BEGINS,"" read the headline. However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the ""bathroom bill"" was to be passed. In fact, according to Snopes, the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy. 5. Does the article cite primary sources?      It's not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral. One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a ""clear parasite"" was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel. Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company. Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found -- because the story is 100% fake. 6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable?A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it: People.com has extensive archives, and this quote is nowhere to be found in them. 7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story? During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as ""reported"" by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as ""reported"" by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It's always good to trace a story back to the original source, and if you find yourself in a loop -- or if they all lead back to the same dubious site -- you have reason to doubt. 8. Is your own bias getting in the way?Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook's algorithm -- the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence. ""We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,"" says Zimdars. ""If we come into contact with information we don't agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.""So if you find an outrageous article that feels ""too good to be true,"" use caution: It just might be. 9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization? Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know you're getting the real deal. View the whole list here. 10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites? This is where things can get tricky. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars' now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list. While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as ""fake"" is not accurate. ""I want to make sure this list doesn't do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,"" she says. ""It's interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing."" "

technology,http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/aviation/sports-car-with-wings-icon-a5/index.html,Flying a sports car with wings,,"Tampa, Florida (CNN) — When it comes to piloting a plane, I have zero experience.In fact, I've never even considered attempting it. Nevertheless, as we swoop over Florida's Tampa Bay on a gorgeous November morning, I enthusiastically take over the controls of the ICON A5, a two-seater amphibious plane that looks like a sports car, maneuvers like a jet ski and is so intuitive, the company says that even a novice can learn to fly it in less than 30 hours.At 23 feet long and weighing in a 1,510 pounds, it's known as a sea light-sport aircraft.Designed to help you focus on the freedom of flying without worrying if the plane will react unpredictably, there's nothing else quite like it on the market.Now that I'm in control, my whole body tenses for a good five minutes. Am I really ready to pilot this shiny new machine all by myself? I'm not entirely sure.However, I take comfort in the fact that the A5 was built specifically for people like me, and it was designed to drive like a car. Plus, the fact that Icon's CEO and founder, Kirk Hawkins, is next to me in the cockpit doesn't hurt either. He can take over the controls at any time.So far, so good.We glide smoothly through the air at about 1,000 feet, and I'm comfortable enough to take in the sights. Lovely Fort De Soto Park doesn't disappoint. levartSquiggles of dreamy white dunes are surrounded by water that looks like it should be in the Caribbean. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, with its series of long-spanning cables, is equally impressive.The adrenaline is still racing. And as most surreal experiences go, it just keeps getting better. For starters, there's another ICON A5 to my left, which is thrilling in itself. We are flying in formation, and my job is to mimic its movements. You'd think this would be intimidating, but it's not. It's just plain fun.That's music to Hawkins' ears. He's the brains behind this newfangled plane, an idea 10 years in the making.As a former Air Force F-16 pilot and a Stanford Business School grad, he has focused most of his adult life on making sport flying available to the masses. ""The idea for us was to create an airplane where the average human being can go out and experience the world without having the burden of becoming a professional pilot,"" he says. So it makes sense that the dashboard looks like what you see in your car. There are only a few gauges that I don't recognize.""It's the Apple approach to things,"" he says. ""You humanize it, and make it intuitive and easy and cool.""He's so confident people will want to fly (and buy) his planes that he just opened a flight-training facility at Peter O. Knight Airport. Located on Davis Island, five minutes from downtown Tampa, it's a place where both beauty and sailboats abound. The company's other training center is in Vacaville, California, where ICON is headquartered. Wide eyes and open windowsBy 9 a.m., it's time for a brief water-landing pitstop. Hawkins takes over the controls. I've been too busy learning to fly in formation (not something non-pilots get to try very often) and interviewing Hawkins to even think about learning to do a water landing myself. It's something Hawkins tells me most people can master in about 30 minutes.  A few negative-Gs and 360-degree turns later and it becomes a fun roller-coaster ride in the sky. Plus, it's an open-air flight, so I occasionally flop my arms out. Just because I can.At a few hundred feet above the water, it's easy to spot a boater waving at us, a flock of pelicans and even stingrays. ""We're gonna pull over here and stop and get out for a second,"" he says. Surely he's kidding, right? But after landing the plane on the water, he takes off his seatbelt, and I realize he's not.Sky pioneers: A light aircraft revolution is taking offSeconds later, he pops the roof and we climb onto the wings, which could easily double as diving boards. Suddenly, this feels less like a plane outing and more like I'm on a boat sunbathing. Everything is drenched in a mesmerizing golden hue. I can imagine picnicking on the beach nearby. Or taking the plane somewhere for a remote weekend camping trip. Because the plane has a range of about 430 miles on a full tank, it's made for short getaways.""This entire thing is about inspiring people,"" he explains. ""Once you learn to fly, you will never be the same. You will look at the sky different, you will look at the planet different.""Designed to make flying simple""The primary motor skills for operating a plane are pretty easy,"" Hawkins tells me. ""We have people landing by themselves with an instructor on their very first day, within 30 minutes."" That said, they've painstakingly taken the time to design it for safety. The goal of the spin-resistant airframe feature is that if the pilot makes mistakes, the airplane doesn't lose control. As a backup, there's a complete airplane parachute.""The spin resistance feature is a big deal as it's the first airplane that the FAA has deemed spin-resistant,"" says Chris Dupin, a flight instructor and US Air Force officer. ""A significant number of general aviation fatalities are from loss of control accidents that involve an unrecovered spin on the base to final turn.""Plus, there's the angle of attack indicator, something you don't typically see in a light aircraft. It shows you where the wing is happy (in the green) or where it could stall (in the red). The pilot's job is to keep the wing within the green or yellow section of the gauge. This is part of what makes water takeoffs and landings so easy to learn. Becoming a barnstormer""Kirk Hawkins has an extremely creative and innovative idea for pilot training that is more intuitive; teaching the feel of flight first and the principals and structure later, not unlike how people learn to drive,"" says Christine Negroni, veteran aviation journalist and author of ""The Crash Detectives.""""The world is facing a pilot shortage, so the idea of teaching differently, so that different learning styles can be accommodated could very well expand the pool of pilot candidates.""On that note, about 40% of the folks who've put down deposits for the ICON A5 are not pilots, which means this plane is drawing aviation newbies. After an hour and a half of flying time, Hawkins lands us on the airport runway, a maneuver that you can tackle after you've mastered several water landings. It's a bit trickier since it requires more precision and knowledge about crosswinds. At this point, if I owned this plane, I'd hook it up to a trailer, fold the wings up, drive it home, and park it in the garage. Get some air timeIf you want your own ICON A5, get in line. More than 1,800 customers have put deposits down. For those who aren't ready to shell out $207,000 to buy one, there's the option of stopping by ICON's training facility in Tampa, or the facility in Vacaville, California, to fly for the day. The Sport Flying Introduction class is 1.5 hours for $595. To snag your Sport Pilot License, you will need to spend 20-plus hours and pricing varies.

technology,http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/health/astronaut-back-pain-spine-health-space/index.html,Going to space is a real pain in the back,"By Ashley Strickland, CNN","Story highlightsAstronauts can temporarily gain 2 inches in height but suffer muscle loss and back painMore countermeasures involving exercise may help mitigate pain and muscle loss (CNN)A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study. In 1994, astronaut Mark Lee had his height measured by fellow astronaut Jerry Linenger as part of a study on back pain.Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission. Mars mission astronauts could experience brain damage, study saysThings don't improve when they return to Earth's gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc. ""It's sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,"" said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. ""So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts' backs.""Like being in a body castRead MoreMuch attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang's team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling. Hope, Courage and Unity: The story behind the young cancer patients who painted space suitsWhat they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury. In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren't using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren't bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months. Our bodies in space: Zero gravity weighs heavy on your healthMRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. ""Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,"" Chang explained.Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts' potential time spent in Martian gravity -- 38% of the surface gravity on Earth -- creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.The team's future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.Yoga in space?Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine. Astronauts ask Congress to take care of their healthIn addition to the ""fetal tuck"" position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done. ""A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit."" Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station. Scott Parazynski, who walked in space seven times, assisted with construction on the space station in 2007.Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.One of Chang's teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity. Join the conversationSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.""When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,"" he said. ""Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet. And they look out the other window and just see infinity stretching off into the blackness, and they come back with a different sense of themselves and their place in the universe.""All of them are committed to furthering space knowledge and making incremental steps forward in any way they can for the next crew."""

Attention!"" blares the Russian voice from a loudspeaker. ""The nuclear bombs will be launched in one hour.""Inside a room styled as a Soviet-era nuclear bunker, a couple of Russians race to prevent a catastrophic strike on the United States.Their quest -- the latest craze in Moscow -- is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general. It's complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.But amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.   Read MoreA mad Russian general has pushed the nuclear button - and gamers must stop missiles launching ""I'm worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,"" said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.  ""I know that normal people all over the world don't want any war,"" he added. A nation preparing for conflictBut Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia's old Cold War rival. Russian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry issued this picture from a nationwide civil defense drill The video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.   Of course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.  Analysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction -- or MAD -- still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War. Lithuania issues manual on what to do if Russia invadesBut with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real. ""I don't think nuclear war is likely,"" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a prominent foreign policy journal.""But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don't have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,"" he told CNN. Kremlin playing up fearsIt is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.  In its flagship current affairs show, Russia's top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev -- dubbed the Kremlin's propagandist-in-chief by critics -- recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.  ""Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,"" he declared.Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable conflictThe Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal. The Satan 2, as it's known, will be the world's most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia's place as a top nuclear power. It is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow. ""I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,"" said  Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer. ""But it sounds ridiculous to me and I'm totally sure that war is impossible,"" she adds. The quest game players - pretending to be a special ops team - are the only ones who can avert warBack in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch.  The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack. Hopefully, the real world will be spared such a confrontation too. "

The chair enables its wearer to effectively sit down and stand up at the same time.The Archelis chair.""The Archelis concept is very simple, like the simplicity of Columbus' egg,"" says Dr Hiroshi Kawahira, the surgeon behind the concept. ""Long surgeries can result in back pain, neck pain, and knee pain -- especially for surgeons who are older.""Made of 3D-printed panels, Archelis does not require any electrical components or batteries. The innovation is in the effective design: flexible carbon panels wrap around the buttocks, legs and feet to provide support and minimize pressure on joints.The system stabilizes the ankles and knees, so the pressure from being upright is spread evenly across the shins and thighs.Though the wearer appears to be standing, in fact, they are resting their back and legs while working on their feet.

The technology enables users to turn any surface into a smart screen, as well as interact with other smart devices.Walking around at home, users can project a laptop screen onto a wall, switch on a coffee machine, read on any surface, and make online purchases with the point or swipe of a finger. The developers -- Israel-based MUV Interactive and Japan-based Silicon Technology -- expect BIRD to be embraced by the education and corporate sectors, thanks to its ability to create collaborative presentations."
technology,http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/health/kids-sleep-screens-tech/index.html,Cell phones and screens are keeping your kid awake ,"By Susan Scutti, CNN","Story highlightsDevices in the bedroom are associated with children losing sleep time and quality, new research saysEven children and teens who don't stay up late online are losing sleep (CNN)These days, teachers often face classrooms filled with yawning students who stayed up late snapping selfies or playing online games. For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don't use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.The analysis found ""a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,"" said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King's College London. Carter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.Kids can't sleep? 10 tips that will helpFew parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a ""strong and consistent association"" between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Read MoreSurprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.Though Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was ""how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,"" many of us will probably recognize our own families' habits reflected in the statistics.Electronic bedroomA large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.According to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children's sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game. Light emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.How an early bedtime can have lasting effects on kidsCarter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.""Sleep is vital for children,"" said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. ""We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more."" Kansagra, author of ""My Child Won't Sleep,"" noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. ""It's hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.""Kansagra said it's possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. ""For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,"" he said.Practicing good sleep hygieneDr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child's healthy development, even though ""we don't know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.""In many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. ""Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,"" said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own ""personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.""Join the conversationSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Sleep hygiene -- tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep -- include having a room that is quiet. ""And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,"" Kline said.One more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation, which recommends at least 30 minutes of ""gadget-free transition time"" before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.Other recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment.

Australian Open sagaDjokovic landed in Melbourne on January 5, only to be placed in temporary detention with his visa canceled because he did not have a valid medical exemption for the vaccination requirement for all arrivals.Djokovic's team argued the 34-year-old tennis star was under the impression he could enter the country because he had received a medical exemption from the tournament organizers, which had been granted on the grounds that he had natural immunity after being infected with Covid-19 in December.Under Australian law, medical exemptions are only given to people who can prove they've suffered anaphylaxis after a previous dose, or any component of a vaccine, or are significantly immunocompromised. Djovokic didn't fit either category.The following week, a judge quashed the government's decision to cancel his visa and ordered him to be freed, allowing Djokovic to resume training for the Australian Open.A man takes a selfie with Djokovic as he arrives at Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade, Serbia.However, in another twist just days before the tournament began, Australia's Immigration Minister Alex Hawke chose to cancel Djokovic's visa again, and the player was put back in detention.Hawke argued that Djokovic posed a risk to public health and order, and could encourage anti-vax protests, which could aid the spread of Covid-19.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosDuring the two-week period when all this unfolded, both supporters and critics of Djokovic took to the streets of Melbourne -- some protesting that his release made a mockery of the sacrifices Australians have made to contain Covid, others arguing he had a right to compete.Djokovic's legal challenge failed the second time around, with three Federal Court judges unanimously dismissing his application, saying Hawke's argument was not irrational.

In winning the Australian Open on Sunday after an epic final with Daniil Medvedev, the Spaniard claimed his 21st grand slam title, one more than Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. The three had been tied on 20 for a while, but after overcoming a long-running foot injury, Nadal now stands a step above the members of tennis' ""Big Three.""However, although he recognized his achievement in winning his record-breaking grand slam title, Nadal admitted it doesn't change his outlook on his career or legacy. ""No, I don't want to change my point of view, honestly. Of course, for me, it's amazing to achieve another grand slam at this moment of my career. Just means a lot to me,"" he told reporters. Read More""I feel honored. I feel lucky to achieve one more very special thing in my tennis career. I don't care much if I am the one or not the one or the best of the history, not the best of the history. Honestly, today, I don't care much. For me, it's about enjoying nights like today. That means everything for me, no? Means even more to achieve the second Australian Open more than any other thing.""So with Nadal looking like he's returning to his best tennis, with Federer continuing to struggle with injury and questions surrounding Djokovic's participation in future events due to his Covid-19 vaccination status, what could the future hold for the superstars of the sport? Nadal celebrates match point after beating Medvedev. 'I am proud to share this era with you'Nadal, Federer and Djokovic have lit up tennis over recent years, doing battle on numerous occasions and delivering some famous encounters. Both Federer and Djokovic were quick to congratulate Nadal on social media after his victory on Sunday. ""What a match! To my friend and great rival (Nadal), heartfelt congratulations on becoming the first man to win 21 Grand Slam titles,"" Federer wrote on his Instagram stories. ""A few months ago, we were joking about both being on crutches. Amazing. Never underestimate a great champion. Your incredible work ethic, dedication and fighting spirit are an inspiration to me and countless others around the world. ""I am proud to share this era with you and honored to play a role in pushing you to achieve more, as you have done for me for the past 18 years. I am sure you have more achievements ahead but for now enjoy this one!""Djokovic wrote on Twitter: ""Congratulations to (Nadal) for 21st GS. Amazing achievement. Always impressive fighting spirit that prevailed another time. Enhorabuena. (Medvedev) gave it his all out there and played with the passion and determination we have come to expect from him.""The 40-year-old Federer has been struggling with a knee injury, which is the reason he's been absent from the court. World No. 1 Djokovic -- arguably the favorite to win the tournament beforehand -- was deported from Australia after losing a court challenge against the Australian government's decision to cancel his visa on public health and order grounds.The second grand slam of the year is the French Open at Roland Garros which begins on May 22. Nadal, now returning to full fitness, is sure to be the heavy favorite on the clay courts of Paris having won a record 13 French Open titles. Djokovic's availability at the grand slam in France is still in doubt as the country's Sports Ministry told CNN earlier in January that all professional athletes who wish to compete in France will have to be vaccinated against Covid-19.France's vaccine pass law, approved by parliament in January, will require people to have a vaccine certificate to enter public places such as restaurants, cafes, cinemas and sports arenas, among others.""The rule is simple. The vaccine pass will be required once the law comes into force in institutions that were already subject to the health pass (sporting or cultural). This will apply to everyone (spectators, professional sportspeople),"" a French Sports Ministry spokeswoman told CNN.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosNadal poses with the Australian Open men's singles final trophy in the locker room.That new legislation puts the chances of Djokovic, who has not been vaccinated against Covid-19, competing at Roland Garros in jeopardy.Nadal and Federer are older though than the 34-year-old Djokovic -- Nadal is 35 and Federer is 40 -- meaning the Serbian does have time on his side to be able to try and catch Nadal. But with a new crop of tennis superstars blossoming at the moment -- with Medvedev at the forefront alongside Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Andrey Rublev, Casper Ruud and Felix Auger-Aliassime amongst others -- staying at the top has never been more difficult for tennis' greatest ever players.

There had been major doubts about whether or not Nadal would even be fit enough to play at the Australian Open after missing the second half of 2021 with a foot injury.However, he returned to action at the Melbourne Summer Set tournament at the beginning of January, going on to win his first ATP title since May 2021.After beating Matteo Berrettini in the Australian Open semifinal, Nadal said he was just happy to be back on the court after being beset by injuries.Read MoreAs he sank to the floor, exhausted but victorious after five-and-a-half enthralling hours, Nadal proved he was not only fit enough to still compete at grand slams, but could realistically still win several more.""It has been one of the most emotional matches in my tennis career and to share the court with you [Medvedev] was an honor,"" Nadal said in his on court interview.

At the other end of the court, Medvedev looked like he'd barely broken a sweat.Indeed, Nadal's serve was broken to love in his very next service game as Medvedev took a 3-2 lead. Things were looking ominous.Two more easy holds followed, as did another easy break of Nadal's serve, as Medvedev closed out the first set without dropping another game.Daniil Medvedev comfortably took the first set against Nadal.Nadal fights backNadal desperately needed to try something different in the second set; Medvedev was hitting the ball harder and more cleanly and felt like the favorite to win each point at the start of every rally.The Spaniard opened the second set with a relatively comfortable hold of serve -- perhaps his only one of the match so far -- celebrating with a shout of ""si"" and a fist pump towards his box as he attempted to fire himself up.It clearly worked as Nadal earned his first break of the match in Medevedev's next service game -- and he was really made to earn it.Nadal ended a mammoth 40-shot rally with a quite ridiculous sliced backhand that Medvedev couldn't get anywhere near to open up a 15-40 lead, eventually breaking serve with his second break point to go 3-1 up.However, after an easy hold of serve, Medvedev held his own serve before breaking Nadal back -- much to the despair of the boisterous crowd on Rod Laver.This match, though, was becoming unpredictable and Nadal broke Medvedev's serve once again to take a 5-3 lead and give himself the chance to serve for the second set. To make matters more complicated, an incident in the stands forced a number of security guards to come onto the court and stand around the two players as a man apparently attempted to jump onto the court.Rafael Nadal rallied in the second set.In keeping with the rest of the match, it was a brutal game that lasted more than 12 minutes and it was Medvedev that came out on top, finally breaking back with his fifth break point to make it 4-5 and deny Nadal the set.The pair exchanged holds of serve until the set reached a tie break. Nadal had done well to make this match a contest, but winning this set was felt crucial to ensuring the final would go the distance.The Spaniard has produced some Herculean efforts throughout his career, but coming from two sets down here was surely beyond him. Wasn't it?As the clock ticked over the two hour mark, both players continued to produce outstanding tennis but it was once again Medvedev who got the better of Nadal.One crucial point in the tie breaker -- with Nadal leading 5-4 -- went to the Russian as Nadal's volley dropped just wide. The hawkeye system confirmed the line judge's call, but the decision was still roundly booed by the crowd.After Medvedev hit the backhand winner that earned him the tie break and deflated the crowd, he turned to look at the stands and raised his arms above his head as a mixture of cheers and jeers rained down.Daniil Medvedev was cheered and jeered after winning the second set.Down, but never outDespite the bitter disappointment, Nadal began the second set strongly and had a wonderful chance to give himself two early break point, but a less than perfect approach shot allowed Medvedev to hit a huge backhand winner that flashed past his opponent at the net.Nadal glanced up at his box with a worried look on his face, knowing how costly these squandered opportunities would be.The set -- and the match -- soon looked like it was over with Nadal 0-40 down while serving at 2-3.But the Mallorcan has forged a reputation as one of the biggest warriors on the court and, even now in twilight of his career, there are no signs of that fight fading.Nadal clawed his way back to deuce, before eventually winning the game to level the third set.The momentum of this final swung dramatically with Medvedev serving at 4-4, as nerves seemed to be getting the better of the Russian as he approached the finish line.One bizarre attempt at a drop shot resulted in the ball hitting the net and Medvedev sarcastically applauded the crowd, who he felt had made noise before he hit the shot, leading to a loud chorus of boos.Rafael Nadal takes in the crowd after hitting a winner.Nadal broke his opponent with an incredible backhand passing shot down the line and the Rod Laver arena erupted -- it was by some distance the loudest sound of the night.Unlike in the second set, Nadal held serve with ease thanks to four straight winners to make it 2-1 and Medvedev appeared to be rattled.During the changeover, he told the umpire that some fans were ""idiots with empty brains"" after one supporter had shouted just before Nadal was going to serve.The comeback is onThe momentum continued to swing further in Nadal's favor at the start of the fourth set, as the Spaniard somehow managed to save two break points to make it 1-1.Medvedev had certainly allowed to let the fans get inside his head, as a double fault to hand Nadal a break of serve ended with him sarcastically applauding and putting his thumb up to the crowd.The Russian calmed himself down during the change of ends and responded with an immediate break back, leading the area to burst into a chorus of ""let's go, Rafa, let's go.""However, he just couldn't stop a resurgent Nadal. Medvedev managed to take his next service game to deuce after being 0-40 down, but Nadal was relentless in his pursuit of another break of serve and eventually got it at the seventh time of asking to end another marathon game.Nadal was now playing some of the best tennis of his life -- and it had to be that good to beat his opponent -- holding his next service game to take a 4-2 lead in the fourth.Medvedev had also called the trainer to massage his right thigh and at times he appeared to be in a little discomfort when moving that leg.Daniil Medvedev looked to be struggling at the back of the court.Nadal's next service game was the biggest of the set, as he rattled off four straight points from 15-40 down to make it 5-3.Medvedev managed to hold the next game, fending off a set point, but it was just delaying the inevitable as Nadal closed it out with a faultless service game. This match was quickly turning into one of the all-time great grand slam finals.Rafa returnsMedvedev had to dig deep again at the beginning of the fifth set, saving another early break point. It was the 12th break point he'd saved in the match, a new record for the Russian.There was seemingly now no stopping Nadal, as he broke his opponent's serve once again to take a 3-2 lead -- perhaps for the first time he would allow himself to start thinking about number 21.Nadal ensured, for the time being, that Medvedev didn't get back into the set, saving multiple break points in a game that went to deuce six times to make it 4-2.The match clock now showed these two show stoppers had been battling it out for five hours, yet neither player looked like dropping their level any time soon.Nadal was soon serving at 5-4 to win the championship and had a 30-0 lead, seemingly on the cusp of creating history. However, Medvedev dug deeper still to win four straight points and break back at the most vital of moments.Rafael Nadal lifts a historic 21st grand slam trophy.However, Nadal was just not going to be denied his record title. He broke back immediately, perhaps playing his best tennis of the final, and then had his second chance at serving for the championship.It was a chance he wouldn't squander again, holding his nerve expertly to etch his name into the history books.Given where he was just sixth months ago, at times pondering retirement, Nadal's victory here in Melbourne will go down as one of tennis' greatest wins."

""I'm a fortunate and lucky girl to have so much love in my corner, we started together right from the start. We did it all together, nobody has changed from our team. I love you to death.""As an Aussie the most important part of this tournament is being able to share it with so many people and the crowd, you have been nothing short of exceptional.""This crowd is one of the most fun I've ever played in front of and you guys brought me so much joy today and helped me play my best tennis, so thanks for all your love and support over the last couple of weeks.""This is a dream come true for me and I am so proud to be an Aussie. See you next time.""READ: Rafael Nadal is one win away from record-breaking grand slam title after reaching Australian Open finalAustralia's Ashleigh Barty celebrates after beating Danielle Collins.Blistering startNeither player showed any signs of nerves in the opening stages and exchanged some blistering shots early on.Collins' trademark backhand was causing Barty all sorts of problems, with the Aussie struggling to contain the powerful groundstroke as it ripped through the Rod Laver court.However, Barty was able to respond on her own serve, crushing an early 181km/h ace past her opponent as she managed to save an early break point -- much to the delight of the crowd.The partisan home support was certainly showing its allegiances early on, erupting each time Barty won a point. They were then really given something to cheers in Collins' third service game, as a couple of loose groundstrokes and a wild double fault gifted Barty a break of serve.That certainly helped release any tension Barty was still feeling, as the home favorite ripped off two more holds of serve to claim the opening set in the blink of an eye.Even Collins' reaching the final is one of the most remarkable comeback stories in tennis.In April last year, she underwent emergency surgery for endometriosis -- a condition where the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of it -- and had suffered an abdominal injury at the French Open.Danielle Collins began dominating the second set.The 28-year-old has spoken candidly about the excruciating pain she endured, describing it as some of the worst she has experienced.Collins has credited the surgeon for saving her career and she's now playing some of the best tennis of her life, with her run to final in Melbourne projected to push her into the world's top 10 for the first time.Huge credit must go to the player for remaining unperturbed that a close opening set had gotten away from her so quickly.The American often wears her heart on her sleeve on the court, but had so far kept her emotions hidden on the biggest occasion of her career.However, that changed at the start of the second set as Barty once again began to struggle with her opponent's powerful shots, which now seemed to have just a little more sting.Two uncharacteristic errors from Barty in her opening service game of the set allowed Collins to break for the first time in the match. Rod Laver arena fell largely silent, save for Collins' roar. ""Come on,"" she shouted, fist clenched towards her box.It had been quite a remarkable change in momentum from the opening set, with Collins now dominating almost every rally.The fans did their fans to rally behind Barty in the second set.The crowd, sensing Barty's nerves, did their best to get her back into the match; one forehand winner down the line was greeted with the perhaps the loudest cheer of the night so far.However, it wasn't enough to get Barty back on track as the size of the occasion now seemed to be weighing heavily on her.The forehand was becoming wild and erratic and Collins found another break of serve to seemingly put the set out of her opponent's reach.But Barty, the fighter that she is on the court, battled back and recovered one of those breaks of serve, before firing off a love service game to pile the pressure back onto Collins.It was pressure Collins couldn't handle as her first serve and usually trusty backhand deserted her, gifting Barty a second break of serve.The Rod Laver arena, which had been subdued for most of the second set, erupted and was now louder than it had been all evening. Barty claims the third grand slam title of her career.At one point, Collins seemed unhappy with a number of the people in the crowd who had begun shouting before the points were finished, leading the umpire to warn those in attendance about their conduct.Barty held serve to level the scores at 5-5 and what looked like 20 minutes ago was going to be a walkover set for Collins had now turned into a slugfest.Both players put in solid service games to take the set to a tie break, though Collins must have been wishing those first serves had come a couple of games earlier.Barty raced into 4-0 lead in the tie break and never looked like losing it from there, eventually closing it out 7-2 -- and it was now party time on Rod Laver.After waiting 44 long years, Australia once again has its own grand slam singles champion."

But from then on the Dutchman proved unstoppable when claiming a second Grand Slam title.Host broadcaster Channel 9 delayed its prime-time news bulletin to show the final in its entirety and Alcott's influence was clear to see all around Melbourne Park's main showcourt.The size of the crowd, which followed a doubles encounter involving Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis, would be the envy of many tournaments. There were also several wheelchair-bound children watching the final around the stadium.Schroder said Alcott had been an inspiration.""You have inspired so many people to get out there to play sports,"" he added.

The headline act? 'Special K,' otherwise known as Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis. The Australian wildcard duo have whipped fans into a frenzy throughout their unlikely journey into the semifinals of their home grand slam, peaking with a raucous 7-5 3-6 6-3 quarterfinal victory over Tim Puetz and Michael Venus at a packed Kia Arena on Tuesday.Hype men to the crowd, chest bumps, Cristiano Ronaldo tribute acts -- to highlight the tennis alone would not do justice to the spectacle the Australian pair have provided.Read MoreKyrgios and Kokkinakis have brought a new level of showmanship to the Australian Open doubles competition.Arguably doubles has an awkward place in the tennis world -- with singles events consistently taking precedence in both prize money and coverage -- which makes the attention and adulation that the duo are garnering all the more impressive.Yet for Kyrgios and Kokkinakis, their relationship with the crowd is a symbiotic one, and forms the crux of their motivation to perform.""This Australian Open, honestly for us, it's more about the people -- playing for them is more important than our doubles success, Kyrgios said.""We haven't drawn up any goals of what we wanna achieve this year in doubles, I just wanna play and give the people of Australia and the Australian Open a show and genuinely try and grow the sport of tennis. ""That's why I'm playing, and I know Thanasi is just enjoying it -- this is the most fun we've ever had on the court.""The thrill for us is honestly walking out there. This sounds stupid but we worry what happens in the match after,"" Kokkinakis added.""Seeing the support we've got and then the crowd going nuts every time we go out there and how much they're enjoying it, that gets us going and gets us motivated to do better for them.""Kyrgios (bottom C) gives a racket to a boy he had hit with a tennis ball.Tears and cheersA perfect encapsulation of the pair's connection with the Melbourne crowd -- as well as Kyrgios' enigmatic personality -- came early in the first set of the quarterfinal when the 26-year-old ferociously lashed a returning dead ball into the crowd after a let serve.The ball struck a child, bringing him to tears, with a mortified Kyrgios covering his mouth in shock. After a brief chat with Kokkinakis, Kyrgios jogged over to the stand to hand over a token of apology to a boy who -- though admittedly still a little watery-eyed -- now brandished a smile, a new racket, and a monster of a story to share at school. The subsequent warm ripple of applause from the crowd was a response the oft-dubbed 'bad boy of tennis' has not always received. On court antics have at times marred an undoubtedly talented career -- an immaturity he admits to -- with Kyrgios telling CNN last year that he had a ""love-hate"" relationship with the sport.Six years after his grandmother passed away, Nick Kyrgios grapples with demonsYet this doubles run looks to have really fired up Kyrgios and there can be no doubt which side of ""love-hate"" this year's crowd falls on -- especially the swathe of young fans that have packed into the duo's games at Melbourne Park.""There's no way around it, me and Thanasi are definitely role models to the youth in Australia, we obviously attract that crowd,"" Kyrgios said.""I know that over the years i haven't been the best role model but I was just learning how to deal with everything and i think now at 26 i've matured and I definitely realized that a lot of young kids and people -- even people that are low on confidence -- they do look towards us when we go out there.""We're not special people, we're normal humans that you might see walking in Australia ... I think we're just relatable, that's what's the best thing about it.""Kokkinakis (L) and Kyrgios celebrate after beating Puetz and Venus.RelatableFor the 26-year-old Krygios, difference is the keyword to his place in the sport.""Tennis has always had personalities, I've said this before but I think they just struggled to understand that there are different ways to go about it. ""You've got Roger Federer and these guys that are just once in a generation athletes -- I can't be like that, we're not like that, there has to be people that are a little more relatable.""Ability aside, Krygios and Kokkinakis are putting on a once in a generation spectacle at the Australian Open -- just spare a thought for Melbourne's lovers of peace and quiet should they go all the way.

The ruling said it was open to the minister to infer Djokovic's presence could encourage anti-vax protests, which could aid the spread of Covid-19. And they noted the minister's decision also included the star's possible influence on people who were unsure about whether to take the vaccine.""The possible influence on the second group comes from common sense and human experience: An iconic world tennis star may influence people of all ages, young or old, but perhaps especially the young and the impressionable, to emulate him. This is not fanciful; it does not need evidence,"" the ruling said.Read MoreThe explanation ends one of the most controversial episodes in the history of the Australian Open.The world's No. 1 men's player was forced to leave the country on the eve of the competition after the court failed to find fault with the immigration minister's decision to cancel his visa.It was the second time Djokovic's visa had been canceled -- the first came in the hours after his arrival in Australia on January 5, when Australian Border Force (ABF) officers rejected his purported exemption from rules that state all new arrivals must be fully vaccinated.Djokovic said a previous Covid infection meant he was exempt, but under federal rules that's not enough and he was detained in an immigration facility.The matter went to court and a single judge ruled the decision was ""unreasonable"" because he wasn't given enough time to consult his lawyers. Djokovic was freed from detention and resumed his training at Melbourne Park in the hope of securing his 21st grand slam title.However, days later the government intervened to cancel his visa again, stating the unvaccinated player was a threat to public health and order. The issue was referred to a higher court and the three judges convened last Sunday.Djokovic's legal team didn't argue the merits of the minister's decision, only that he had made a jurisdictional error under the country's migration law.On Sunday, the judges ruled there had been no error and Djokovic agreed to leave.In a statement, the player said he was ""disappointed"" with the decision but respected the court's ruling. That night he departed Melbourne en route to Serbia, where he received a hero's welcome.Fans wave Serbian flags as tennis player Novak Djokovic arrives in Belgrade on Monday, January 17.Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said Australia's treatment of the star was ""scandalous."" Brnabic told CNN Wednesday she didn't know why Djokovic wasn't vaccinated, but added she doesn't believe he's an anti-vaxxer.""He supports the vaccination of those people who want to be vaccinated. So I am not perceiving him as anti-vaxxer,"" she said. In a statement soon after Sunday's ruling, Djokovic's family blamed the decision on politics. ""This isn't just a sports issue and playing at the first grand slam of the season, dominated by Novak for a decade now, but politics as well all the interests that took priority over sports,"" the statement said. Under Australian law, Djokovic can be banned from the country for three years, though Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews hasn't ruled out an exemption. ""Any application will be reviewed on its merits,"" she said earlier this week.On Tuesday, Tennis Australia expressed regret the visa dispute had distracted players in the tournament.""We deeply regret the impact this had on all players,"" the statement said.

During the tournament, Efremova's mother received the news that her husband was soon going to lose that battle.Julia says she had to make the difficult decision about whether to tell Efremova during the tournament or wait until it was over.""It was very tough, but Ksenia was in the tournament and I had to tell her,"" she says.

The evening before, a building in Belgrade was illuminated with the words ""Nole [Djokovic's nickname], you are the pride of Serbia."" The Serbian Olympic Committee said it was ""very disappointed"" over Australia's ""scandalous decision"" to deport Djokovic, adding that a ""huge injustice"" had been committed, while Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said the visa cancellation was ""scandalous.""Djokovic lands in Belgrade having been deported from Melbourne.

The 25-year-old couldn't have hoped for a better script for any potential entry she pens for January 17 as she won her opening match 6-3 6-3 against Colombian Camila Osorio on Rod Laver Arena.Osaka, who is the 13th seed in this year's draw, raced into a 5-0 lead in the opening set on Monday before some spirited play from 20-year-old Osorio and a few unforced errors allowed her a route into the match. The Japanese star did eventually manage to clinch the first set. In the second set, Osorio had two early break points but was unable to take advantage. Osaka broke into a 3-1 lead and a stray Osorio backhand into the net finally gave Osaka the victory to get her title defense off to the perfect start. Read More""I thought I played pretty well given the circumstances, I didn't have a lot of information about my opponent,"" said Osaka in her on-court interview.She added: ""I hope that we gave you a really good performance. It always feels very special for me to come back here. I have a lot of really good memories here.""Osaka plays a forehand against Osorio during their women's singles match on day one of the Australian Open.Osaka will face Madison Brengle in the second round after the American advanced when Dayana Yastremska retired trailing 1-6 6-0 0-5.Earlier this month Osaka played her first match in four months after she took a break from tennis after a defeat to Leylah Fernandez at the US Open Last year, she also withdrew from the French Open, citing mental health issues, and chose not to participate at Wimbledon.The four-time grand slam champion said she is prioritizing her enjoyment on the court during her time in Melbourne. ""I can't expect myself to win every match, but I do expect myself to have fun and challenge myself,"" she said. ""I'm here because I want to be here and because I find that it's fun for me.""I accept the fact that I'll have dips, and I need to figure out a way to overcome it.""Osaka celebrates her match point against Osorio.Could this be the year?

In what was his 70th win at the competition, Nadal continued his fast start to 2022 on the Rod Laver Arena. Having missed the end of the 2021 season thanks to a foot injury, Nadal won the Melbourne Summer Set title two weeks ago, his first tournament win on Australian soil since the Australian Open in 2009. Novak Djokovic is 'the best player in the history of men's tennis' but he is leaving a 'complicated' legacy off the courtAnd the 35-year-old maintained his good form against Giron, a dominant 24-minute first set setting the tone. Nadal continued to keep his foot down throughout, breezing past world No. 66 Giron without too much fuss. Nadal is the only former champion left in the draw -- with Novak Djokovic deported and Roger Federer injured -- meaning he can become the men's all-time grand slam record winner by winning in Melbourne. And he stressed the importance of winning last week at the Melbourne Summer Set after beating Giron. ""Last week had been important for me. I played three matches, I won three matches. I won a title, it's always beautiful,"" Nadal said. ""And I think I am doing better and better.

Hawke said those rules had kept Australians ""safe"" during the pandemic and were ""fundamental"" in ""safe-guarding Australia's social cohesion.""""Australians have made great sacrifices to get to this point,"" the statement said.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison echoed his message in a statement to the media.""This cancellation decision was made on health, safety and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so. I welcome the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe,"" he said.""I thank the Court for their prompt attention to these issues and the patience of all involved as we have worked to resolve this issue. It's now time to get on with the Australian Open and get back to enjoying tennis over the summer.""Although Covid-19 cases are rising in Australia, the country has a high rate of vaccination and its death toll from Covid-19 remains relatively low compared to other countries. Last week the country surpassed 1 million Covid-19 cases over the entire pandemic -- but more than half of those were in the last two weeks.What happened in courtSunday's hastily convened Federal Court hearing considered whether Hawke's decision to cancel Djokovic's visa was ""unreasonable.""The 34-year-old Serbian tennis star challenged the immigration minister's decision on three grounds, including that the minister failed to properly consider the consequences of canceling his visa.Djokovic's barrister Nick Wood said Hawke's decision was ""irrational"" as the minister had failed to consider that the act itself could galvanize anti-vaxxers -- the very thing the government wanted to prevent.But Stephen Lloyd, the lawyer for Hawke, said under Australia's Migration Law the minister didn't need to prove Djokovic was a risk to public health, just that he ""might"" be.He said Djokovic's anti-vax attitudes were apparent by his failure to be vaccinated, despite having an opportunity to do so before arriving in Australia. He added that the perception that Djokovic opposed vaccination was enough to risk inciting anti-vaxxers in the country, and that the tennis star's apparent disregard for Covid-19 rules meant there was a risk others would emulate his actions and ignore public health orders.Tennis Australia, the national governing body for tennis and organizer of the Australian Open tournament, said it ""respects the decision of the Federal Court"" regarding Djokovic's visa.Djokovic has been replaced in the draw by Italian Salvatore Caruso, who will face Serbian player Miomir Kecmanović.The ATP described the decision to uphold the cancellation of Djokovic's visa as ""the end of a deeply regrettable series of events"" and said his absence from the Australian Open was ""a loss for the game.""A long-running sagaThe saga began nearly two weeks ago, when Djokovic's visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival on January 5. Under current Australian laws, all international arrivals are required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 -- which Djokovic is not -- unless they have a medical exemption.Djokovic said he was under the impression he could enter because two independent panels associated with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government had granted him an exemption on the grounds that he had been infected with Covid-19 in December.What we know: Novak Djokovic and Australian Open timeline  The federal government argued that, under its rules, previous infection with Covid-19 is not a valid reason for an exemption.On his arrival in Australia, Djokovic was taken to the Park Hotel in Melbourne, which is also used as a detention center for refugees, while lawyers prepared a case to overturn the decision.On Monday, Judge Anthony Kelly ruled that border officers had been ""unreasonable"" when they canceled his initial visa to enter Australia and ordered Djokovic to be freed from immigration detention.Djokovic's visa was revoked for the second time on Friday by Hawke, but the government agreed not to deport the tennis star over the weekend before his case had concluded.Despite a verdict finally being reached in court, the events over the last two weeks still split opinion and the fallout can be expected to continue for days to come. It is unclear when Djokovic will take to the court again after he said he was taking ""some time to rest and to recuperate, before making any further comments beyond this.""He will have the chance to break the men's grand slam title record at the French Open in May but the saga has raised questions about how unvaccinated players will compete on the season's tour. It also threatens to tarnish Djokovic's incredible achievement in the sport with the issue still proving divisive around the world.

The tournament, however, has largely been overshadowed by the high-profile saga off the court, pitting one of tennis's biggest stars against Australia's government and public health officials.Djokovic's visa was revoked for the second time on Friday by Alex Hawke, Australia's immigration minister, but the government has agreed not to deport Djokovic over the weekend before his case has concluded.Djokovic's lawyer, Nicholas Wood told the court that the immigration minister had used his personal power to cancel the 34-year-old's visa based on grounds he would ""excite anti-vax sentiment"" should he remain in Australia, describing it as a ""radically different approach"" in the government's argument. ""The underlying new rationale is not a direct risk to others, it's that Mr Djokovic being in Australia, in Melbourne in particular, by being here will excite anti-vax sentiment. That's the point. A radically different approach,"" Wood said. 'It's not a good situation': How the world reacted after Novak Djokovic has visa canceled again Under current Australian laws, all international arrivals are required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 -- which Djokovic is not -- unless they have a medical exemption.Djokovic said he was under the impression he could enter because two independent panels associated with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government had granted him an exemption on the grounds that he had been infected with Covid-19 in December. The federal government argued that, under its rules, previous infection with Covid-19 is not a valid reason for an exemption.Djokovic's legal team challenged the Friday ruling, and the case was transferred up the chain to Australia's Federal Court. After an emergency hearing Friday, Judge Kelly ruled that Djokovic would have to submit to an interview with the Australian Border Force at an undisclosed location. Kelly ordered authorities to then place Djokovic in detention and escort him to his lawyer's office while his case appears before the Federal Court. Djokovic's visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival on January 5, but Kelly ruled earlier this week that border officers had been ""unreasonable"" when they canceled his initial visa to enter Australia. The judge then ordered Djokovic to be freed from immigration detention."

Australia's federal court is a higher body than the court Kelly presided over.""Today I exercised my power under section 133C(3) of the Migration Act to cancel the visa held by Mr Novak Djokovic on health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so,"" said Hawke in a statement earlier on Friday. Read More""In making this decision, I carefully considered information provided to me by the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Border Force (ABF) and Mr Djokovic. The Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting Australia's borders, particularly in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.""The decision comes four days after judge Kelly ruled that  Australian Border Force (ABF) officers had been ""unreasonable"" when they canceled his initial visa to enter Australia on his arrival in the country on January 5. The judge ordered Djokovic be freed from immigration detention within 30 minutes.The second cancellation is the latest twist in a saga that has garnered global headlines and put Australia's Covid and immigration policies under scrutiny. Novak Djokovic is 'the best player in the history of men's tennis' but he is leaving a 'complicated' legacy off the courtUnder current Australian laws, all international arrivals are required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 -- which Djokovic is not -- unless they have a medical exemption. Djokovic said he was under the impression he could enter because two independent panels associated with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government had granted him an exemption on the grounds that he had been infected with Covid-19 in December.The federal government argued that, under its rules, previous infection with Covid-19 is not a valid reason for an exemption.Despite Monday's ruling, the immigration minister retained ministerial power to personally intervene in the case and ultimately had the final say as to whether Djokovic would be allowed to stay, though his decision can be appealed. In his ruling, the judge noted that if Djokovic had been deported, he would have been banned from Australia for three years. However this can be waived in special circumstances.Minister for Immigration Alex Hawke used his executive powers to cancel Djokovic's visa.Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the minister's decision to cancel Djokovic's visa protected ""sacrifices"" Australian had made throughout the pandemic. In a statement, Morrison said the ""pandemic has been incredibly difficult for every Australian but we have stuck together and saved lives and livelihoods.""""Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected,"" he said. ""This is what the minister is doing in taking this action today.""Djokovic to be detainedDjokovic will be interviewed by the ABF at 8 a.m. local time on Saturday (Friday 4 p.m. ET) at an undisclosed location ""agreed between the parties"" in the case. At that point, Djokovic will be officially detained by two border force officials and escorted to his lawyers' office while his case is heard in the federal court. The location where Djokovic will be met by border officials will remain secret in order to keep the tennis star safe and prevent ""a media circus.""""We have a genuine concern about security and a potential media circus,"" Djokovic's barrister Nick Wood told the court when imploring Judge Kelly to allow Djokovic to be handed over to border officials in private.

How it came to thisDjokovic arrived in Melbourne on January 5 and promptly had his visa canceled for entering the country without a valid reason why he couldn't be vaccinated against Covid-19.He spent several nights in a detention hotel in Melbourne, which also houses dozens of refugees -- some of whom have been held in immigration detention for more than eight years.His lawyers challenged the decision and won the legal battle on Monday, but since then questions have emerged over Djokovic's behavior after testing positive for Covid-19 on December 16.In a statement published to social media on Wednesday, Djokovic acknowledged he did not immediately isolate after receiving a positive diagnosis -- but denied knowing he had the virus when attending several public events.Djokovic admits he didn't immediately isolate after positive Covid test, as Australia probes possible discrepancies in testsHe also apologized for apparently false information on his Australia visa declaration, specifically that he hadn't traveled in the 14 days before his arrival in the country. Photos taken during that period appear to show him in both Spain and Serbia.Djokovic said a member of his support staff submitted the information and the omission had been ""human error.""In the statement, Djokovic also admitted doing an interview and photo shoot with a French sports newspaper while Covid positive, which he conceded was an ""error of judgment.""The visa dispute and decision whether to allow Djokovic -- who has previously voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates --  into the country comes at a time when Covid-19 case numbers are soaring.On Friday, the state of Victoria -- home to Melbourne where the Australian Open is being held -- reported 34,836 cases, with a record 976 people hospitalized with Covid-19. This week the country surpassed one million cases over the entire pandemic.What could come nextMaria Jockel, legal principal of BDO Migration Services, said Djokovic's lawyers will have 28 days to make representations to the minister, stating why he should reverse his decision.Despite his visa being canceled once again, experts say it is still possible Djokovic could be released on another visa to contest the Australian Open.Novak Djokovic's fans are fighting to get him out of his hotel. Inside, refugees wonder if they'll ever leave""If there's an incredible outcry about having the world's No. 1 tennis player in detention whilst the Australian Open is on, maybe the government would relent and let him out on a bridging visa,"" said Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary with the immigration department.A bridging visa would allow Djokovic to work -- or, in this case, play -- but the political repercussions of that decision are unclear as it would seem to contradict the message that Djokovic poses a health risk to the Australian people.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said earlier Friday the issue had a simple solution: ""Just get vaccinated.""""That is the key ... That's what I say to every single Victorian. That's what I've done. That's what my kids have done,"" he said, adding the Australian Open was bigger than one player and the issue far bigger than one person.CNN Tennis Contributor Ben Rothenberg and CNN's Angus Watson, Jessie Yeung and Ivana Kottasová contributed.

Djokovic won his first grand slam title at the Australian Open in 2008, after which he had to wait three years for his next major triumph, again at the Australian Open. Grand slam titles -- 11 in total -- came thick and fast in the six-year period between 2011 and 2016, culminating in Djokovic claiming the ""Nole Slam"" as the defending champion of all four grand slam tournaments at the same time. But an elbow injury in 2017 derailed Djokovic's progress. His initial unwillingness to undergo surgery frustrated his former coach Andre Agassi, who told The Guardian he thought Djokovic had hoped his elbow would ""heal naturally, holistically.""Djokovic eventually opted for surgery in early 2018 and returned to the court a few months later, but it was a setback that had almost led to him quitting tennis altogether. ""To do the surgery, it was against his core values,"" his wife Jelena told CNN in 2019. ""It was really huge, it's like he buried one part of him with that decision. He said: 'I'm done, I'm not playing tennis anymore, I lost this, I'm not having fun anymore, this is it.'""Since that elbow surgery, Djokovic has won eight grand slam titles across a four-year period, eventually equaling Federer and Nadal's record at Wimbledon last year. Many see it as only a matter of time before he owns the record outright and establishes himself as the greatest player in the history of men's tennis -- a titan on the court with a complicated, controversial legacy off it.CNN's Christina Macfarlane, Don Riddell, Ben Church, Hannah Ritchie, Jessie Yeung and Angus Watson contributed to reporting.

Hopefully he can play.

Voracova was detained last Thursday in the same hotel as Djokovic before she left the country on Saturday.Speaking to Reuters in a video call, Voracova said she went through immigration without facing any problems and believed she would have been competing at the Australian Open if the furore around Djokovic's visa and his vaccination status had not erupted.""I was there already for one week and since he arrived things changed,"" she said.

Following hours of deliberations, technical glitches and arguments from both sides, Justice Anthony Kelly ordered Djokovic to be released from a temporary hotel detention facility and his possessions returned within 30 minutes of the Monday ruling.Justice Kelly also ordered the respondent in the case -- the Australian Ministry of Home Affairs -- to pay Djokovic's legal costs. Following the decision, a lawyer for the government said Australia's Minister for Immigration reserves the right to personally intervene in the case. Christopher Tran, acting for the government, said Minister Alex Hawke retains ministerial power to remove Djokovic from the country, despite the ruling. After the hearing, Djokovic tweeted that he was ""pleased and grateful"" at the outcome. He said that ""despite all that has happened,"" he wants to remain in country to ""try to compete"" in the Australian Open. He also thanked his supporters for standing with him and encouraging him to ""stay strong.""

The following day, he was also photographed at a youth awards event.The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) called the series of events leading up to the hearing ""damaging on all fronts"" -- including to the athlete's well-being, according to a statement from the association on Monday.The earlier ruling, held via video link at the Australian Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne, comes after days of speculation and public anger about whether the tennis star would be able to play in the Australian Open, despite being unvaccinated for Covid-19. The 34-year-old Serb flew to Australia on January 5, only to have his visa canceled after Australian Border Force deemed his medical exemption from requirements that all arrivals be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 was invalid. Faced with deportation and his hopes of winning a record 21st grand slam in jeopardy, Djokovic launched a legal challenge.People are seen outside the Law Court building on January 10, 2022 in Melbourne, Australia. During the hearing, Djokovic's legal team argued he had obtained the required medical exemption to travel to Australia and bypass vaccination restrictions for Covid-19. That exemption had been granted on the grounds that Djokovic had natural immunity after being infected with Covid-19 in December, his defense argued.Djokovic, who has previously voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates, was unvaccinated when he arrived in Australia. In his ruling, the judge noted that if Djokovic had been deported, he would have been banned from Australia for three years.The case has attracted worldwide attention and sparked anger from both his supporters and critics, with some saying his case shows celebrities are getting special treatment when it comes to Australia's tough Covid-19 rules, which have seen families separated for years, and others who believe coronavirus restrictions are encroaching on their civil liberties. Djokovic's situation has also highlighted the plight of asylum seekers in Australia -- with dozens of refugees inside the same hotel as Djokovic who have been locked up for years, and who face indefinite detention under Australia's tough immigration rules.The arguments The arguments for both the defense and the government essentially centered around guidelines issued from an advisory group for the federal government called the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (ATAGI). Nick Wood, Senior Counsel representing Djokovic, argued ATAGI advice states that past Covid infection provides at least six months of natural protection -- ""and therefore may be regarded as a temporary exemption to vaccination.""He said Djokovic understood he'd been given approval to come to Australia by the government, and had made repeated appeals to federal officers in Melbourne that ""he had done absolutely everything that he understood was required for him to enter Australia.""""Any reasonable person would understand, and he did understand, that he had ticked absolutely every box,"" Wood added.Novak Djokovic of Serbia plays a backhand shot during a Davis Cup match at OlympiaWorld on November 27, 2021 in Innsbruck, Austria.Lawyers for Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Karen Andrews, defended the Australian Border Force decision to deport Djokovic, arguing the tennis star did not provide any medical reason why he could not be vaccinated against Covid-19. The government said Djokovic was mistaken to think he was guaranteed entry, and that a previous Covid infection does not equate to a valid medical reason why he could not be vaccinated.They pointed to the same ATAGI guidelines, which say despite acknowledgment of natural protection, past infection ""is not a contraindication to vaccination"" -- meaning it is not a valid reason for somebody not to get the vaccine.The government also argued that while those guidelines suggest people can temporarily put off their vaccination after acute illness, ""there was no suggestion Djokovic was seriously ill.""""All he has said is that he tested positive for Covid-19. That is not the same,"" the government said in its court submission. Police personnel watch pro-refugee protestors rally outside the Park Hotel, where Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic is believed to be held, in Melbourne, Australia, January 10.Tran, the government's barrister, said authorities have a low bar to canceling visas and that even the possibility of a risk to Australians' health was reason enough. Justice Anthony Kelly, however, appeared to acknowledge Djokovic's position, saying he was ""agitated"" by the burden placed on the tennis star to provide officials with evidence.Djokovic had recorded a Covid-19 infection in December -- which two independent panels agreed to be a good enough reason to delay Djokovic's need to be vaccinated.""What more could this man have done?"" Judge Kelly said. What Djokovic is playing for at the Australian OpenThe visa debacle had threatened Djokovic's chances of winning a record 21st grand slam at the Australian Open, which kicks off in Melbourne on January 17. Djokovic currently holds 20 grand slam singles victories, equaling the all-time record with Spain's Rafael Nadal and Switzerland's Roger Federer. A victory in Melbourne would mean Djokovic breaks the record for the most career grand slams ever held by a man. That is a very real possibility -- Djokovic has won the Australian Open nine times before. Federer, 40, is not playing in Melbourne and while Nadal, 35, is set to play, he has been beset with injury. The pair have faced each other 58 times, with Djokovic leading with 30 wins to 28. Nadal, who has won one Australian Open in 2009, is ranked world No. 6.

Court documents published on Saturday by Australia's Federal Circuit show that Djokovic was granted a medical exemption to compete after testing positive Covid-19 in December. His lawyers are appealing the visa cancellation and did not wish to comment ahead of his court hearing Monday.People hold placards outside the Park Hotel where 20-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic is staying in Melbourne on January 7, 2022.Djokovic case has gone far beyond an individual visa issue. It's prompted anger from people who feel the rich and powerful are getting an easy ride when it comes to Australia's tough Covid-19 rules, which have seen families separated for years -- but it's also angered anti-vaxxers who believe coronavirus restrictions are encroaching on their civil liberties. And it's prompted concerns from Australia's Serbian community, some of whom say Djokovic is being unfairly targeted.But Djokovic's situation has also highlighted the plight of asylum seekers in Australia. While the tennis star will ultimately either be allowed to play in the tournament or forced to leave the country, other detainees in the same facility have been locked up for years -- and face indefinite detention under Australia's tough immigration rules. Widespread outrageAs dozens of protesters from disparate groups of the political spectrum gathered outside the Park Hotel on Friday, there was one thing that united them: the push for freedom.Some were from Serbian cultural groups, singing and waving the Balkan country's flag, who saw Djokovic's detention as a great injustice against one of the world's biggest sports stars.""I don't see why he should be stuck in a detention center,"" said Tara, a 17-year-old Australian-Serb and junior tennis player, who did not give a last name.

But others focused their attention on the approximately 30 refugees held in the hotel. Authorities detain another top-flight tennis player over visa issues ahead of Australian Open Previously used by the Australian government as a Covid-19 quarantine facility, the hotel has been an Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) for refugees and asylum seekers for at least a year. Nearly a decade ago, Australia said no asylum seekers who arrived by boat would ever be settled in the country. Hundreds were housed at offshore processing centers for years, although some were sent to hotels in Australia to be treated for health conditions. The refugees still have little hope of freedom, and the conditions they are held in is hugely controversial. Standing in front of the Park Hotel, which is tagged with the words ""free them,"" Tom Hardman, a 27-year-old teacher, said he had come out in support of the refugees.""I'm here because the loneliness and the heartache these men suffer from not knowing when they will be released is unbearable to witness,"" he said. Police stand guard at the government detention center.Oscar Sterner, 25, said he was opposed to both anti-vaxxers and the way refugees were kept in detention -- and said the real problem was putting an unvaccinated visitor in a hotel with refugees who required medical attention. ""Djokovic is a millionaire scumbag who has rightly incurred the anger of a lot of people in Australia,"" he said. ""He can't be bothered to get vaccinated to protect the people around him.""What it's like insideDjokovic's supporters have hit out at his treatment, with the tennis star's mother saying her son is being ""treated like a prisoner."" ""It's so dirty and the food is so terrible,"" Dijana Djokovic told reporters Thursday at a news conference in Serbia's capital, Belgrade. ""It's just not fair. It's not human.""American tennis star John Isner also tweeted in support of Djokovic, saying keeping him in the hotel was ""not right.""""There's no justification for the treatment he's receiving. He followed the rules, was allowed to enter Australia, and now he's being detained against his own will.

""It is the individual traveler's responsibility to make sure that they have in place all the necessary documentation that is needed to enter Australia.""Australian immigration laws allow for an up to three year re-entry ban into the country following a visa cancellation under certain conditions -- but it is unclear if Djokovic will face such a penalty.In a statement Friday, the Professional Tennis Players Association said Djokovic had verified his well-being.""With the utmost respect for all personal views on vaccinations, vaccinated athletes and unvaccinated athletes (with an approved medical exemption) should both be afforded the freedom to compete,"" said the association, which was co-founded by Djokovic. ""We will continue to support and advocate for our members, and all players, in a manner that is acceptable to them.""Australia vowed to never let these men settle on its soil. Some just got visasAccording to human rights lawyer Alison Battisson, who has four clients inside the Park Hotel, visitors without the correct visa for Australia are normally handcuffed and transported to an immigration detention center in an unmarked van with blacked-out windows. ""It is an incredibly traumatic and dehumanizing process,"" she said. Video of the Park Hotel shared with CNN shows detainees in small rooms that include a double bed, a TV and some chairs. Asylum seekers have access to a stairway that leads them to a rooftop where they are able to smoke. It's unclear whether Djokovic is staying in the same conditions. ""This is a window, we can't open it at any stage,"" said Adnan Choopani, one of the detainees, in a video filmed for CNN. While the hotel appears clean and well-kept in footage filmed by Choopani, there have been reports of issues in the past. According to Battison, there was a Covid outbreak in the facility last year, and detainees have reported finding maggots in their food.The other detaineesFor the 30 or so refugees held in the hotel, the media spotlight on Djokovic is difficult to swallow. Many have been detained for years -- and have little hope of ever getting out.Mehdi, who asked to only use one name to protect his family, escaped from Iran when he was 15 years old and has been held in Australian detention for more than eight years with limited access to education or health care. ""I've served my time,"" said Mehdi, who turned 24 on Friday. ""We are suffering, we are exhausted and we are tired ... you are in indefinite detention, which means they can keep you as long as they can, as long as they want.""Cousins Adnan Choopani and Mehdi were 15 when they fled Iran. Now, they're 24 and still in immigration detention.Choopani said he and his fellow detainees were just sitting in their rooms, with many of them taking medication for depression. Choopani is Mehdi's cousin, and he left Iran when he was also 15. He dreams of taking a walk on a street or going out for a coffee. ""It's unbelievable,"" he said. ""I think this is just a nightmare ... we live in the 21st century, in a country who believes in democracy still doing this kind of behavior to innocent people.""Although it's unclear whether Djokovic will be allowed to play at Melbourne Park this month, the tennis star will eventually be let out of the hotel.Craig Foster, a former Australia national team footballer who advocates on behalf of the asylum seekers, says he hopes at least some good can come from the situation.""In one way, it's good for the world to see how Australia has been treating our entrants, whether they're asylum seekers or refugees, or indeed an athlete like Novak who has simply fallen afoul, apparently, on the documentation on his visa,"" he said. ""If anything, we're hoping that this entire embarrassing saga comes to place Australians in a position where they understand more the plight of these people."""

However, according to The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Border Force contacted the state Victoria government after learning of an issue with the visa submitted by Djokovic's team while the Serb was on his way to Australia. The 20-time grand slam champion reportedly traveled to Australia on a visa that does not permit medical exemptions for being unvaccinated, Australian news outlets reported. Acting Victoria Sports Minister Jaala Pulford confirmed in a tweet on Wednesday that the government would not support Djokovic's visa application. Read More""The Federal Government has asked if we will support Novak Djokovic's visa application to enter Australia. We will not be providing Novak Djokovic with individual visa application support to participate in the 2022 Australian Open Grand Slam,"" wrote Pulford.""We've always been clear on two points: visa approvals are a matter for the Federal Government, and medical exemptions are a matter for doctors,"" she added.Australian news outlets reported that the Australian Border Force subsequently sought support from the Victorian government to facilitate Djokovic's entry because Victoria partners with Tennis Australia in running the Australian Open.Both The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Djokovic would likely be allowed off the plane and into Melbourne, but the situation was still ongoing at midnight local time.Neither Tennis Australia nor Djokovic's team was immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN.Djokovic's coach, Goran Ivanisevic, posted a photo to social media from what appears to be the Melbourne Airport, where the men's tennis world No. 1 is reportedly being held due to the visa mix-up.Ivanisevic posted the photo of him and others with the caption, ""Not the most usual trip Down Under,"" on Instagram on Wednesday.

Australians have responded with anger and skepticism to the news that men's tennis No. 1 has been granted an exemption to compete.There had been uncertainty over Djokovic's participation after players were told they would have to be fully vaccinated in order to participate or have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts. The exemption from the vaccine mandate means he will defend his 2021 title in Melbourne.Djokovic, who is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on 20 grand slam singles titles, has not publicly revealed his vaccination status but voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates in April 2020.""Personally, I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,"" he said in a Facebook live chat, according to Reuters.But in May of last year, Djokovic said vaccination was a matter of personal choice: ""I will keep the decision as to whether I'm going to get vaccinated or not to myself.

It's de-identified and we are where we are, and so the tennis can begin,"" she said, according to Reuters. Djokovic's exemption comes two weeks after Russian tennis player Nata Vikhlyantseva revealed she would be unable to travel to the tournament because her vaccine is not recognized by local health authorities.The Sputnik V is not on the list of vaccines currently approved by the Australian government, leaving world No.195 Vikhlyantseva ineligible to play.JUST WATCHEDNovak Djokovic is the no. 1 of number onesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNovak Djokovic is the no. 1 of number ones 03:44Under the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's (ATAGI) current guidelines, a medical exemption is granted to individuals who have an ""acute major medical condition (e.g. undergoing major surgery or hospital admission for a serious illness.""

He was knocked out at Roland Garros in the French Open semi-finals and was forced to pull out of Wimbledon, the Tokyo Olympics and the U.S. Open.The positive COVID-19 test cast further doubt on whether the Spaniard would play at the Australian Open -- a tournament where he has won once and been runner-up four times.Rafael Nadal missed Wimbledon, the US Open and the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.Read MoreNadal will be expected to kick off his preparations for the Grand Slam by returning to the tour for the first time since August at the ATP 250 event in Melbourne from Tuesday.His arrival will be a boost for the organisers of the Australian Open, which has been ravaged by injuries with Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Dominic Thiem, Serena Williams and Bianca Andreescu all missing.While Nadal ended the speculation surrounding his participation, local media in Australia reported that Venus Williams has joined sister Serena in skipping the hardcourt Grand Slam.Seven-time major winner Venus would have required a wild card into the main draw but has decided against travelling to Melbourne, according to News Corp.There was still uncertainty if Serbia's world number one Novak Djokovic will play at the Australian Open, where the 34-year-old has won a record nine titles including the last three.Speculation over Djokovic's participation was heightened after he pulled out of the Serbia team for the ATP Cup in Sydney which starts on Saturday.

Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/ba-2-covid-severity/index.html,"As BA.2 subvariant of Omicron rises, lab studies point to signs of severity","By Brenda Goodman, CNN"," (CNN)The BA.2 virus -- a subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant -- isn't just spreading faster than its distant cousin, it may also cause more severe disease and appears capable of thwarting some of the key weapons we have against Covid-19, new research suggests.  New lab experiments from Japan show that BA.2 may have features that make it as capable of causing serious illness as older variants of Covid-19, including Delta.  And like Omicron, it appears to largely escape the immunity created by vaccines. A booster shot restores protection, making illness after infection about 74% less likely.BA.2 is also resistant to some treatments, including sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody that's currently being used against Omicron.  Dr. Tom Frieden: Why I'm cautiously optimistic about Covid-19The findings were posted Wednesday as a preprint study on the bioRxiv server, before peer review. Normally, before a study is published in medical journal, it is scrutinized by independent experts. Preprints allow research to be shared more quickly, but they are posted before that additional layer of review.Read More""It might be, from a human's perspective, a worse virus than BA.1 and might be able to transmit better and cause worse disease,"" says Dr. Daniel Rhoads, section head of microbiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Rhoads reviewed the study but was not involved in the research.BA.2 is highly mutated compared with the original Covid-causing virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. It also has dozens of gene changes that are different from the original Omicron strain, making it as distinct from the most recent pandemic virus as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were from each other. Kei Sato, a researcher at the University of Tokyo who conducted the study, argues that these findings prove that BA.2 should not be considered a type of Omicron and that it needs to be more closely monitored.CDC unveils its latest weapon in Covid-19 detection: wastewater""As you may know, BA.2 is called 'stealth Omicron,' "" Sato told CNN. That's because it doesn't show up on PCR tests as an S-gene target failure, the way Omicron does.  Labs therefore have to take an extra step and sequence the virus to find this variant. ""Establishing a method to detect BA.2 specifically would be the first thing"" many countries need to do, he says.""It looks like we might be looking at a new Greek letter here,"" agreed Deborah Fuller, a virologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but was not part of the research.Mixed real-world data on subvariant's severityBA.2 is about 30% to 50% more contagious than Omicron. It has been detected in 74 countries and 47 US states.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 4% of Americans with Covid-19 now have infections caused by BA.2, but many other parts of the world have more experience with this variant.  It has become dominant in at least 10 other countries: Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Denmark, Guam, India, Montenegro, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines, according to World Health Organization's weekly epidemiological report.But, there's mixed evidence on the severity of BA.2 in the real world.  Hospitalizations continue to decline in countries where BA.2 has gained a foothold, like South Africa and the UK.  But in Denmark, where BA.2 has become the leading cause of infections, hospitalizations and deaths are rising, according to WHO.Resistant to monoclonal antibody treatmentsThe new study found that BA.2 can copy itself in cells more quickly than BA.1, the original version of Omicron.  It's also more adept at causing cells to stick together.  This allows the virus to create larger clumps of cells, called syncytia, than BA.1.  That's concerning because these clumps then become factories for churning out more copies of the virus. Delta was also good at creating syncytia, which is thought to be one reason it was so destructive to the lungs.When the researchers infected hamsters with BA.2 and BA.1, the animals infected with BA.2 got sicker and had worse lung function. In tissues samples, the lungs of BA.2-infected hamsters had more damage than those infected by BA.1.How worried should we be about the new 'stealth' Omicron? Our expert weighs inSimilar to the original Omicron, BA.2 was capable of breaking through antibodies in the blood of people who'd been vaccinated against Covid-19.  It was also resistant to the antibodies of people who'd been infected with Covid-19 early in the pandemic, including Alpha and Delta.  And BA.2 was almost completely resistant to some monoclonal antibody treatments.But there was a bright spot:  Antibodies in the blood of people who'd recently had Omicron also seemed to have some protection against BA.2, especially if they'd also been vaccinated.And that raises an important point, Fuller says.  Even though BA.2 seems more contagious and pathogenic than Omicron, it may not wind up causing a more devastating wave of Covid-19 infections.""One of the caveats that we have to think about as we get new variants that might seem more dangerous is the fact that there's two sides to the story,"" Fuller says.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.The virus matters, she says, but as its would-be hosts, so do we.""Our immune system is evolving as well. And so that's pushing back on things,"" she said.Right now, she says, we're in a race against the virus, and the key question is, who's in the lead?""What we will ultimately want is to have the host be ahead of the virus. In other words, our immunity, be a step ahead of the next variant that comes out, and I don't know that we're quite there yet,"" she said.  For that reason, Fuller says, she feels like it's not quite time for communities to lift mask mandates.""Before this thing came out, we were about 10 feet away from the finish line,"" she said. ""Taking off the masks now is not a good idea. It's just going to extend it. Let's get to the finish line."""

Japan's Kaori Sakamoto finished in third.Valieva was tipped for gold in the event but fell numerous times during her free skate routine. Standing by the 15-year-old was her coach Eteri Tutberidze on whom the spotlight now falls.In a sample taken in December, prior to the Olympics, Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine, a drug commonly used to treat angina and which experts say can enhance endurance by increasing blood flow to the heart. Kamila Valiyeva (R) talks to her coach Eteri Tutberidze during a training session in Beijing. Pictured behind them is ROC physician Filipp Shvetsky. Valieva blamed her positive drug test on a mix-up that occurred with her grandfather's medication, Denis Oswald, the Chair of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Disciplinary Commission, told reporters Tuesday. Read MoreHowever, the results only came to light during the Olympics. Last week, the Court of Arbitration for Sport gave Valieva the green light to continue competing in the Games because of the exceptional circumstances of her being a minor.The fact that Valieva is a child and failed a drug test has put renewed focus on the adults around her and the alleged dark underworld of Russian figure skating beneath the glittering surface. ""It is clearly a wish and a decision of the IOC but also WADA to examine all aspects of this case including the situation of the entourage, because of course you can imagine a girl of 15 would not do something wrong alone -- so yes, the entourage will be investigated,"" said Oswald.Global Athlete, an athlete-led group working for change across the sporting world, called Valieva's positive drug test ""evidence of abuse of a minor.""Kamila Valyeva of the Russian Olympic Committee in action Thursday night at Beijing's Capital Indoor Stadium. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which regulates the use of drugs in international sport, said it will be investigating the 15-year-old's entourage -- the adults responsible for her skating and welfare.CNN has reached out to the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) for comment from Tutberidze and ROC team doctor Filipp Shvetsky on the points raised in this story but has not received a response.""These (past few) days have been very difficult for me,"" Valieva told Russia's Channel One earlier this week, after training. ""It's as if I don't have any emotions left. I am happy, but at the same time, I am emotionally tired.""Valieva's coach in the spotlightAt the center of the controversy -- and the Russian skating world -- is Valieva's coach, Eteri Tutberidze. Frequently called the most powerful woman in figure skating, Tutberidze is the driving force behind Russia's dominance in the sport. Her studio in Moscow attracts the best female figure skaters from around Russia, who are trained from an early age to break records and perform dazzlingly complex jumps, multiple coaches and skaters told CNN. Valieva made history last week by becoming the first woman to land a quad at the Olympics, and recent female Russian skaters have been known for pushing boundaries on the tricks they can do, from triple axels to triple flips and other difficult combinations. ""We are absolutely sure that Kamila is innocent and clean,"" Tutberidze told Russian TV last week. Tutberidze is also infamous for her brutal training regimens.  In a December interview with Russian TV, she said her skaters train 12 hours a day, saying they can ""always do more, demand more from yourself.""Yulia Lipnitskaia (R) and her coach Eteri Tutberidze during the Sochi Winter Olympics on February 20, 2014. The coach has trained a string of Olympic medalists, but scrutiny has also been cast on how her best protégées have had short-lived careers. Like Valieva, Yulia Lipnitskaya was 15 when she helped Russia win gold in the team event at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. But at 19 years old, Lipitskaya retired from figure skating following a battle with anorexia and injuries. Evgenia Medvedeva was 18 when she won two silver medals at the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics, one each for the single and team event. The two-time world champion unofficially retired from competition last year citing back injuries. And Medvedeva's teammate Alina Zagitova, who won gold in PyeongChang at the age of 15, announced an indefinite break from competition at 19. Zagitova's dominance was record breaking: she was Russia's first skater to win Olympic gold, the World Figure Skating Championships, European Figure Skating Championships and the Grand Prix of Figure Skating. All three were coached by Tutberidze. But Tutberidze also has a lot of supporters. Russian figure skater-turned-coach Anna Pogorilaya, who briefly trained with Tutberidze at her studio, described her as ""an iron lady,"" in an interview with CNN.""She is so dedicated to her vocation... for her, every athlete is like her own child,"" she said, adding that she doesn't believe Tutberidze would pressure her skaters to take performance enhancing drugs. ""I am 100% sure she cannot force her athlete to take anything... I am 100% sure they are clean,"" Pogorilaya said. Team doctor was banned for doping violationsAnother adult close to Valieva is the ROC team doctor Filipp Shvetsky.   The World Rowing Federation confirmed to CNN that Shvetsky was team doctor for the Russian rowing team.He was banned by Russia in 2007 over doping violations, according to Jim Walden, a lawyer for Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, who is under witness protection in the United StatesWorld Rowing says three members of the Russian Rowing Federation were declared ineligible for two years because of violations of the World Anti-Doping Code. He was reinstated by Russia in 2010. ""But this guy (Shvetsky) who's got a history with performance enhancing drugs suddenly shows up as the doctor for this 15-year-old skater... and allegedly, she tests positive for a performance enhancing drug,"" said Walden.ROC figure skating coaches Dannil Gleikhengauz, Eteri Tutberidze (L-R front) and team doctor Filipp Shvetsky attend a training session in Beijing. Walden said Valieva's situation should be looked at within the context of Russia's state-sponsored doping scandal. Russian athletes competing at the Olympics are already under the shadow of a history of illegal doping: WADA barred Russia from international competitions in 2019 over doping violations. Under the ban set to expire later this year, they've only been able to participate as neutrals in the Games.Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, defected to the US and formed the basis of the 2016 McLaren Report which found that more than 1,000 Russian athletes benefited from a systematic doping program between 2011 and 2015. Dozens of Russian athletes were banned after the 2014 Sochi Olympics -- where Russian athletes won more medals than any other country. Opinion: Even if Kamila Valieva wins, she losesRussia continues to deny Rodchenkov's accusations and has said he had personally given drugs to the athletes, who were unaware they were taking banned substances.Under the ban set to expire later this year, Russian athletes have only been able to participate if they can prove they are clean. They compete under the banner of the Russian Olympic Committee, not technically under the Russian flag. ""Russia's not writing on a clean slate. Russia has had a state sponsored doping program since at least the 1960s. It is very well established, it is heavily documented. And so when any Russian athlete tests positive, the Russian state is not doing anyone any favors because there is now a presumption of guilt instead of a presumption of innocence, which for a 15-year-old skater is terrible,"" Walden said. In 2020, the US government signed into law the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, allowing it to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international sports competitions that feature American athletes, sponsors and broadcasters. Walden suggested the US could use the law against Valieva's entourage.""I'm very sure that the FBI and the Department of Justice are going to be investigating already to try to make an example out of the Russian trainers, doctors, coaches, etc. that were responsible for putting this young athlete in harm's way,"" he said.Russian athletes and heart medicationsValieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine and the investigation into the merits of that positive test is ongoing. But it is not the first time Russian athletes have been pulled up for using the drug, or a ""close relative"" of the drug, Walden said.Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova served a 15-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance meldonium in 2016. Sharapova denied doping and said she was first prescribed meldonium in 2006 for heart issues and was unaware the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had recently added it to the banned substance list because she was taking the drug prescribed under another name. The normal course of treatment, according to the drug's prescribing label, is a matter of days to weeks. It is not known why Sharapova's doctor continued to prescribe the drug for years.In PyeongChang 2018, two Russian athletes -- mixed doubles curler Alexander Krushelnitckii and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva -- were excluded from walking behind the national flag during the Closing Ceremony after testing positive for banned substances. Krushelnitckii tested positive for meldonium and Sergeeva tested positive in an out-of-competition test for trimetazidine.Kamila Valieva (R) and Eteri Tutberidze attend a training session on February 12, 2022.""So not only does Russia have a long history of state-sponsored doping, they have a history with this specific drug,"" Walden said. In an interview with Russian TV in 2019, Valieva's coach Tutberidze defended meldonium as harmless, saying that it just ""helps to recuperate the heart muscles."" The ROC said in previous statements that Valieva had ""repeatedly passed doping tests"" while already in Beijing, adding that it is taking measures to keep Valieva's ""honestly won"" gold.""The doping test of an athlete who tested positive does not apply to the period of the Olympic Games. At the same time, the athlete repeatedly passed doping tests before and after December 25, 2021, including while already in Beijing during the figure skating tournament. All the results are negative,"" the ROC statement said.""The Russian Olympic Committee is taking comprehensive measures to protect the rights and interests of the members of the ROC Team, and to keep the honestly won Olympic gold medal.""All of the figure skaters have poured years of blood, sweat and tears to be at the Olympics, but the doping scandal has threatened to steal their moment, and the Games may best be remembered not by performance, but by performance enhancing drugs."

Inside the search for Paislee Shultis,"By Mark Morales and Dakin Andone, CNN"," (CNN)Police had gone up and down the basement stairs several times while searching a home in the Saugerties, New York, area Monday for any trace of 6-year-old Paislee Shultis, who had been missing for more than two years. Roughly an hour and a half into the search, one detective took a closer look at the wooden staircase. ""He couldn't put his finger on it, but there was something about the staircase that bothered him,"" police Chief Joseph Sinagra told CNN. Det. Erik Thiele pointed his flashlight at the spot where a stair met the riser, Sinagra said. Thiele saw what he believed to be a blanket, and police began to disassemble the staircase.""And as they're removing the steps off the staircase, they see a set of feet,"" the police chief told CNN. ""Little feet."" They were Paislee's. She was hidden under the staircase with her noncustodial mother, the chief said, huddled in a nest of pillows, blankets and clothes, in what police described as a ""dark and wet enclosure."" Read MoreToday, the girl is safe, having been returned to her legal guardian and reunited with her older sister. But many questions remain unanswered as investigators try to piece together what she's been through over the last two and a half years. The Paislee Shultis case shows missing persons investigations, especially involving children, can be complicated The girl was unable to go to school and it was unclear whether she'd seen a doctor since she disappeared, the chief said. And it's unknown what impact living in these conditions has had on her. The mother, Kimberly Cooper, was arrested, along with Paislee's noncustodial father and grandfather, who both denied having knowledge of Paislee's whereabouts when police executed their search warrant this week. Cooper was charged with second-degree custodial interference and endangering the welfare of a child, both misdemeanors, according to police. She is out on bail.Kirk Shultis Jr. and Kirk Shultis Sr. were each charged with custodial interference in the first degree, a felony, and endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor. Both were arraigned and released on their own recognizance, police said. All three defendants were ordered by the court to stay away from the child.Lawyers for the men declined to comment, while Carol K. Morgan, an attorney representing Cooper said, ""We should all wait until the facts come out. Everyone should be patient before they draw their own conclusions.""The enclosure where Paislee Shultis and her mother were hidden is seen in this photo from police, taken at their home in Saugerties, New York, on Monday, February 14, 2022. 'They lied to us for two years'Paislee Joann Shultis was reported missing on July 13, 2019, from Cayuga Heights, a village on the outskirts of Ithaca, about 160 miles west of Saugerties. Sinagra told CNN that Cooper and Shultis Jr. had lost custody of Paislee and her sister and a legal guardian had been granted custody. Sinagra told CNN that police had received several tips about the home, and they had been there about a dozen times over the last two years. But each time, residents denied knowing where the girl was and were instead ""adversarial"" with police, Sinagra said. Police made it inside several times but were not allowed in the bedrooms areas or in the basement. ""They lied to us for two years -- including the father stating that he had no idea where his daughter was,"" the chief said.Authorities are piecing together what happened to Paislee Shultis, who was found alive under a staircase. Here's what we knowIt wasn't until Monday that police were able to obtain factual information -- not hearsay -- that helped them secure a search warrant, he told CNN. Uniformed officers were stationed outside the home that afternoon around 4 to ensure no one left or entered before police executed their warrant soon after 8 p.m. In the basement, they found an apartment that included a bedroom with Paislee's name on a wall, Sinagra said. A bed appeared to have been slept in. ""Is she here?"" officers asked, according to the chief. But residents denied anyone was living in the room, he said. ""They said they had set the room up like that in the event that Paislee should ever return.""Paislee was hidden under the stairs just 3 or 4 feet away.Investigators believe the space beneath the stairs was used more than once, Sinagra said -- maybe each time an officer visited the residence. He pointed to how the staircase was constructed along with how comfortable residents appeared Monday as they insisted they didn't know where Paislee was, an indication to the chief they had done this before.Sinagra believes they had been hiding from the time officers arrived outside the home, meaning they could have been in the ""wet"" and ""cold"" space for five hours before they were found. Neither the girl nor Cooper made a sound as police took apart the stairs that hid them, Sinagra said. A detective had described the silence as ""eerie,"" the chief said. While Sinagra is happy that Paislee was found safe, he also said the case was tragic: Whatever the reason Paislee's parents lost custody of her and her sister, he said, that could have ""been rectified by now.""""But this is going to be a major setback for them,"" he said.Correction: The caption on a photo in this story has been updated to correct the date it was taken.CNN's Mirna Alsharif, Christina Maxouris and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report."

At the time of the fire's outbreak, the ship was sailing 90 nautical miles southwest of Portugal's Azores, according to a statement on Wednesday by the Portuguese Navy. After the fire broke out in the cargo hold, it spread and forced all 22 crew members to abandon ship.

And as a reward for the iPhone maker's success, CEO Tim Cook stands to receive nearly $100 million in compensation for 2021. But one influential shareholder rights group has some issues with Cook getting that big of a payday.Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said in a report Wednesday that ""there are significant concerns regarding the design and magnitude"" of the amount of stock Cook is being awarded. As a result, ISS is recommending that investors vote against a proposal to ratify Cook's compensation at Apple's March 4 shareholder meeting.Apple (AAPL) disclosed in its proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year that Cook is set to receive $82.3 million in stock awards on top of his $3 million annual salary and other compensation. The total package works out to $98.7 million, up from $14.8 million in 2020.  Read MoreISS notes that ""half of the award lacks performance criteria."" ISS also has an issue with Apple, saying the company does not detail whether the compensation package covers awards beyond 2021, which is a concern given ""its large size,"" the group said.""Given that CEO Cook will be eligible for retirement treatment after one year from the grant date, the retentive value of the award is limited,"" ISS said.Cook's options would continue to vest in full even after he retires, which ISS also objects to, arguing that Apple doesn't need to give Cook this much financial incentive to stay as CEO.JUST WATCHEDTim Cook became CEO of Apple 10 years ago.

But it's worth noting that another shareholder advisory firm, Glass Lewis, has backed the proposal. And Apple also noted in its proxy statement that Cook's stock award is the first he's received since he became CEO shortly before Steve Jobs died in 2011. ""It has been a remarkable decade for Apple,"" the company said in the proxy statement.Shareholders rarely vote against proposals that a company recommends for approval, although activists have been able to win some converts in recent years. In 2021, investors voted against executive pay packages at Intel (INTC), General Electric (GE) and CNN owner AT&T (T). These votes were largely symbolic, and boards are not obligated to change compensation plans even if shareholders reject them. "

The document says the experiments were carried out pursuant to contractual agreements between UC Davis and Neuralink. In the letter, which spans more than 700 pages, the Physicians Committee said records it obtained for the 23 monkeys used in the experiments reflect a ""pattern of extreme suffering and staff negligence."" The committee said that the letter to the USDA is based on nearly 600 pages of what it calls ""disturbing"" documents released after the committee filed an initial public records lawsuit in 2021.The Physicians Committee said in a press release on February 10 that UC Davis received more than $1.4 million in funding from Neuralink to carry out the experiments on the macaque monkeys. CNN has contacted UC Davis and the Board of Regents for comment. In a statement to KCRA 3, UC Davis spokesperson Andy Fell said: ""The research protocols were thoroughly reviewed and approved by the campus's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)."" Fell added: ""The work was conducted by Neuralink researchers in facilities at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis. UC Davis staff provided veterinary care including round-the-clock monitoring of experimental animals. When an incident occurred, it was reported to the IACUC, which mandated training and protocol changes as needed.""Elon Musk's company, Neuralink, denies accusations of animal cruelty in its testing procedures.On February 10, the Physicians Committee ​says they filed a second public records lawsuit to compel the university to release videos and photographs of the monkeys. Neuralink is not part of the lawsuit.In the lawsuit, the committee alleges that staff at the university ""removed pieces of the skulls of rhesus macaque monkeys and inserted electrodes into the animals' brains.""The lawsuit alleges that monkeys were not provided with adequate veterinary care and that an ""unapproved substance"" known as BioGlue ""killed monkeys by destroying portions of their brains.""In Neuralink's blog, the company said there was ""one surgical complication involving the use of the FDA-approved product (BioGlue),"" and the monkey was euthanized.Elon Musk's Neuralink claims monkeys can play Pong using just their minds In the lawsuit, the committee further alleges that the University of California has ​declined to release photos and videos ​of the experiments, saying the records belong to Neuralink, a private company not subject to California's Public Records Act.In ​a statement posted to Neuralink's website, Neuralink said the company is ""absolutely committed to working with animals in the most humane and ethical way possible.""It also said that its ""central mission is to design an animal care program prioritizing the needs of the animals, rather than the typical strategy of building for human convenience alone.""Neuralink said ""the use of every animal was extensively planned and considered to balance scientific discovery with the ethical use of animals."" In reference to the claims of ​euthanasia by the Physicians Committee, Neuralink stated that ""two animals were euthanized at planned end dates to gather important histological data, and six animals were euthanized at the medical advice of the veterinary staff at UC Davis.""Neuralink said it ​made the decision to partner with UC Davis in 2017 to conduct animal-based research. In 2020, Musk's company opened an in-house 6,000-square-foot vivarium to house farm animals and rhesus macaques​, according to Neuralink's statement.Neuralink said in the statement that it is ""never satisfied with the current standards for animal well being and we will always push ourselves to do more for the animals that are contributing so much to humanity.""Jeremy Beckham, research advocacy coordinator with the Physicians Committee, said in the press release that documents used by the committee in its letter to the USDA ""reveal that monkeys had their brains mutilated in shoddy experiments and were left to suffer and die.""Neuralink has previously said that the goal of their research was to enable a person with paralysis to be able to use a device like a computer or phone using only brain activity."

Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/business/coke-new-flavor/index.html,Coca-Cola introduces a first-of-its-kind flavor,"By Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)Coke's new flavor is out of this world. At least, that's the idea behind Coca-Cola Starlight, a new limited-edition version of the classic soda that comes in regular and zero sugar.  After deciding to discontinue half of its portfolio a few years ago, getting rid of outdated but beloved drinks including Tab and Odwalla, the soda giant has been focusing on promoting its core product, Coke. Starlight is the first beverage from Coca-Cola Creations, a new innovation platform. Unlike ""cherry"" or ""vanilla,"" it's not immediately clear how ""starlight"" is supposed to taste. So Redditors who spotted images of the new product online a few months ago shared some theories about the new drink's flavor. Some say they spotted the mysterious new product on retailer websites ahead of the official launch, slated for next week.One guessed raspberry, because ""a quick Google search says that space tastes like raspberries."" (Astronomers do think that the center of the galaxy may taste like raspberries and smell like rum, according to a 2009 Guardian article. Delicious! And not a bad idea for Coca-Cola, which is launching spiked versions of its drinks left and right.) More recently, a YouTuber who tried the product noted after-tastes of ""chocolate [and] graham cracker."" That led another Redditor to guess that the flavor is ""s'mores."" Read MoreCoca-Cola Starlight is a new limited-time product.On Thursday, Coca-Cola finally cleared up the mystery. Sort of. The company's explanation is ... well, see for yourself: Starlight is ""inspired by space"" has ""notes reminiscent of stargazing around a campfire, as well as a cooling sensation that evokes the feeling of a cold journey to space,"" the company said in a release. So yeah, maybe s'mores? Also, it's red. Or in the company's words, ""Coca-Cola Starlight combines great Coca-Cola taste with a dash of the unexpected, including a reddish hue."" To this reporter, after tasting a sample of the zero-sugar version provided by the company, that last sentence just about sums it up. The beverage did not taste like space travel or sitting around a campfire. It did, however, taste like a sweeter version of Coca-Cola. And it is definitely red. Starlight is getting the full Coca-Cola Creations promotional treatment, which includes a digital marketing campaign featuring pop singer Ava Max. Coke's new marketing strategyLast year, Coca-Cola launched a new brand platform called ""Real Magic."" The idea is to take a slightly different approach to marketing Coke — one that tries to reach new consumers by focusing on gaming and music, among other things. Coca-Cola Creations, which will introduce new limited-time ""products and experiences across physical and digital worlds,"" is part of that platform. ""When we launched 'Real Magic,' we wanted to connect with and celebrate the experiences that bring joy to young people today, and that has taken us to an exciting new territory,"" Oana Vlad, senior director of global brand strategy at Coca-Cola, said in a statement Thursday. For Coca-Cola, reaching young consumers is essential because interest in soft drinks has been declining for years. Exciting new campaigns and mysterious products could be a way to get potential new customers to pay attention. So what does that entail? In the case of Starlight, it means a holographic concert by Ava Max, who has also performed in the gaming platform Roblox. The concert can be accessed via a QR code on the Starlight label. Plus, the sparkly packaging and that reddish hue. But not everything about Starlight is new. It's also a nod to when Coca-Cola actually sent a can of Coke to space in the 1980s. But that one just tasted like Coke. Update: This story has been updated to reflect that Coca-Cola Starlight comes in both zero-sugar and regular varieties."

The braking occurs ""without warning, at random, and often repeatedly in a single drive,"" according to NHTSA. It estimates that 416,000 vehicles may be affected. The agency did not say whether it was aware of any collisions, injuries, or fatalities associated with the issue.The agency's office of defects investigation has received 354 complaints alleging unexpected braking on 2021-22 Tesla Model 3s and Tesla Model Ys in the past nine months. The alleged braking occurs while using Autopilot, Tesla's suite of driver-assist features, which allow the vehicle to brake and steer automatically. Tesla owners sometimes refer to the unexpected brake activation as ""phantom braking.""Tesla is following in the steps of an unlikely rival: SubaruNHTSA's investigation focuses on Teslas produced since the automaker removed radar from most of its vehicles, choosing to rely exclusively on cameras for its driver-assist features. NHTSA is not investigating the Model X and Model S, which Tesla did not immediately remove radar from. One person filing a complaint with NHTSA alleged that their new Tesla, which lacks radar, has more phantom braking issues than their previous Tesla, which had radar.

""The vehicle will randomly brake with no traffic in broad daylight.""Another person who filed a complaint alleged that the problem occurred more than 20 times while on a road trip from California to Colorado.""I believe this problem is extremely dangerous and have not turned on the autopilot features since October,"" the person wrote.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.The agency's investigation is technically a ""preliminary evaluation,"" which can be a precursor to an automaker issuing a recall. NHTSA had opened a preliminary evaluation into Tesla's Boombox feature last fall before the automaker issued a safety recall last month. (The feature was recalled because it could negatively impact the pedestrian warning system and make a crash more likely.)The preliminary evaluation into the unexpected braking will ""determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related issues,"" according to NHTSA.Teslas has faced a string of recent recalls, including issues with a seat belt alert and its ""full self-driving"" software. Electric vehicles like Teslas can often be fixed through over-the-air software updates. Such fixes can be made quickly and aren't as inconvenient or financially burdensome for drivers and automakers as traditional recalls. CNN's Gregory Wallace contributed to this report."
Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/business/jorts-cat-unions-labor-movement/index.html,How a beloved orange tabby cat became a voice for America's union workers,"By Allison Morrow, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)An orange tabby cat named Jorts has become something of a mascot of the labor movement in America. And if none of that charms you, you might as well stop reading now. For the uninitiated: Jorts, along with his feline comrade Jean, became internet famous in December when an anonymous author posted a very sweet story on Reddit about the two workplace cats. In the post, the author jokes about how Jorts is cute but, well, kind of dumb. At least compared with Jean, a tortoiseshell cat who can open doors and doesn't fall into the trash bin all the time like Jorts does. Jean is clearly the brains of the operation, in the author's telling. The story evolves into a dispute with a co-worker who accuses the author of ""perpetuating ethnic stereotypes by saying orange cats are dumb."" Like so much on the internet, the post took on a life of its own. Battle lines were drawn, pro-Jorts alliances formed, and Jorts got his own Twitter account. (Or mostly his own, anyway — Jean helps him.) It now has nearly 139,000 followers.Read More""The explosion of fan art and memes was so entertaining and really touching,"" said the human behind the Jorts Twitter account, who asked to remain anonymous. ""I think we were in a collective moment of needing something tender to gather around,"" the person said of the cats' sudden fame. ""It was also one of those rare stories where there was no villain. Life is full of these stories but they don't often explode online.""It didn't take long for Jorts to reveal himself as a union cat. A prolific tweeter, Jorts has devoted himself to propping up pro-labor accounts, pushing back against inequality and decrying corporate greed. Also, birds. And naps. And knocking over glasses of water. ""I really wasn't expecting that 'Jorts' would take that moment of virality and turn it into an utterly charming, militantly pro-union feed,"" tweeted the political cartoonist Tom Tomorrow. Jorts' mix of practical organizing advice and pure goofiness seizes on America's renewed fervor for unionization and the internet's enduring love of cat memes. It's against the law for your boss to prohibit you from discussing your wages with your coworkers, and also remember there are more workers than there are bosses pic.twitter.com/d5Ln3h7x6N— Jorts (and Jean) (@JortsTheCat) January 2, 2022

Earlier this month, Jorts and Jean tweeted out their ""Four Steps to Form a Union"" — one for each of their paws. Organized labor in the United States is enjoying a renaissance under Joe Biden, the most pro-union president since at least Lyndon Johnson, or perhaps ever, depending upon whom you ask. A survey by Gallup last fall found that 68% of respondents have a positive view of unions — the best reading for that question dating back to 1965, and up from only 48% in 2009. Younger workers are even bigger backers of unions, with 77% of those 34 and younger having a positive view.Over the past year, unionization efforts and strikes (and managers' efforts to quash them) have captured national attention. In December, a Starbucks in Buffalo, New York, became the first US location to unionize despite the company's deployment of a phalanx of executives trying to dissuade the workers. Since then, dozens of Starbucks stores across the country have begun their own efforts. Meanwhile, Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, have renewed their organizing efforts following a defeat last spring, and Target is openly advising its managers on how to prevent employees from unionizing. Against that backdrop, Jorts is at once a purely cute presence and a staunch pro-labor advocate, armed with practical advice and links to resources at the National Labor Relations Board, among others. In a thread posted in January, Jorts offered up a cute photo of himself alongside a sober thread about what can and cannot be talked about in the workplace.""It's against the law for your boss to prohibit you from discussing your wages with your coworkers, and also remember there are more workers than there are bosses,"" one tweet reads.In some ways, Jorts is reminiscent of another ginger icon of leftist Twitter: the Philadelphia Flyers' mascot, Gritty. That 7-foot googly-eyed monster is also an internet sensation who became the star of countless anti-fascist and anti-capitalist memes since he was introduced in 2018. The key difference, apart from their obvious size disparity, is that Gritty himself is apolitical — his big dopey face just happens to work really well in liberal memes, for reasons that don't make any logical sense but need no explanation on social media. Both Jorts and Jean live full-time at a workplace that is staffed 24/7, the person behind the Twitter account told CNN Business. ""If a cat is sick they will come home with someone...They live at work but there is always someone on site.""The person said they'd like to think the cats are unaware of their sudden fame, but ""I almost swear Jean knows. She has gotten extra elusive about spending time anywhere she can be photographed."" Ah, Jean. A lot of things are stacked up real unfair right now. Jean says once we name the unfairness the next step is planning how we fight it pic.twitter.com/T07U8N3SBH— Jorts (and Jean) (@JortsTheCat) February 4, 2022

One of the most endearing elements of Jorts' Twitter presence is his tenderness and affection for Jean, a kind of wise elder sibling who is guiding Jorts on their journey toward justice and equality.  In one particularly tender post, Jorts tweets a photo of Jean with the statement: ""A lot of things are stacked up real unfair right now. Jean says once we name the unfairness the next step is planning how we fight it.""Despite Jorts' articulate messaging and progressive views on workers' rights, he's not interested in political office at this time, according to the person behind the account. ""Jorts is too young to run for office,"" the person said. ""Also,  Jorts and Jean both agree that running for office that would impact human law is best left to someone who has direct experience with being a human.""— CNN Business' Chris Isidore contributed to this article."

Skaggs, 27, died on July 1, 2019, in a hotel in Southlake, Texas, before the team was set to play the Texas Rangers. Kay, 47, was found guilty Thursday of distribution of controlled substances resulting in death and conspiracy to possess with intent distribute controlled substances, according to the federal prosecutor.Prosecutors said Kay faces between 20 years and life in prison when he is sentenced in late June.CNN has reached out to attorneys for Kay.Read MoreSkaggs died by choking on vomit after using drugs and alcohol, according to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office. High levels of opioids, including fentanyl, oxycodone and oxymorphone, were found in his system, as well as alcohol, according to toxicology results. Skaggs' family said it was grateful to the federal prosecutors.""Tyler was the light of our family. He is gone, and nothing can ever bring him back,"" they said. ""We are relieved that justice was served, although today is a painful reminder of the worst day in the life of our family.""Rusty Hardin, an attorney for the Skaggs family, said the verdict is the beginning of justice served.""The trial showed Eric Kay's drug trafficking was known to numerous people in the Angels organization, and it resulted in the tragic and unnecessary death of one of their most popular players.

Former Los Angeles Angels official indicted in overdose death of pitcher Tyler SkaggsAccording to court records, a search of Skaggs's phone revealed text messages from the day before his death suggesting that he had asked Kay to stop by his room with pills late that evening.The Drug Enforcement Administration's investigation found that Kay regularly dealt pills of fentanyl -- dubbed ""blue boys"" for their blue coloring -- to Skaggs and others in the Angels organization at the stadium where they worked, according to an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint. Geoffrey Lindenberg, a DEA special agent, wrote that ""but for the fentanyl"" in Skaggs's system, the medical examiner determined, the pitcher ""would not have died."" US Attorney Chad Meacham said in a statement, ""No one is immune from this deadly drug. A beloved pitcher, Tyler Skaggs was struck down in the midst of an ascendant career. The Justice Department is proud to hold his dealer accountable for his family and friends' unimaginable loss.""Skaggs was a first-round draft pick in 2009. After being traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2010, he made his major league debut two years later as a 21-year-old. The Angels reacquired him before the 2014 season and he was 28-38 in his career. He last pitched two days before his death.""We are saddened by the devastating heartache that surrounds this tragedy, especially for the Skaggs family. Our compassion goes out to all families and individuals that have been impacted,"" Angels' officials said in a statement. ""From the moment we learned of Tyler's death, our focus has been to fully understand the circumstances that led to this tragedy.""We are thankful that Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association have taken the important step to update their drug policies for players using opioids so that they can receive help.""CNN's Matt Lait and Jacob Lev contributed to this report."

A major new exhibition at The British Museum that gathers 430 stunning objects from around the United Kingdom and Europe aims to illuminate the fast-changing and surprisingly sophisticated world in which, for thousands of years, Stonehenge stood at the heart.""It's almost like we've become over familiar with the monument but the context and the people are missing from the picture,""said Neil Wilkin, lead curator of the exhibition. Stonehenge may be a rebuilt stone circle from Wales, new research suggests""We only really understand the monument if you understand what is happening in that world at the time it is built.""The exhibition, which spans a period of 8,000 years, brings to life radical changes: the shift from hunter-gatherer culture to farming and the transition from crafting stone tools and carved rock to mastering metals such as bronze and gold. Stonehenge is a quintessentially English monument, but the grave goods and other artifacts on display reveal long-distance links with Ireland, the Orkney Islands, Scotland, France, Germany -- even ancient Greece.   Long before the stone megaliths were erected -- a task that took generations to complete --  the location was already marked by wooden poles set in three pits that date back 10,000 years, when Britain was still connected to the continent by a land mass known as Doggerland. Headdress, c.9000 BC, Star Carr, North Yorkshire. Credit: © The Trustees of the British MuseumAt this time, life was deeply intertwined with nature. An 11,000-year-old headdress made from the antlered skull of a deer, found in North Yorkshire, would have conferred special status on its wearer.  Stone circles may be the best-known relics of this era, but rarely surviving timber circles were also an integral part of the landscape. A key exhibit is Seahenge -- a wooden circle of 55 timber posts surrounding an upturned oak, with its roots reaching like tentacles into the heavens. It only emerged in 1998 after spending millennia in the sands of a beach in eastern England. Like Stonehenge, it was built to align with the path of the sun, and the tree rings of the oak and posts reveal it was built in the spring and summer of 2049 BC. Some think the oak stump might have supported a dead body during funeral rituals.This finely worked jadeite ax-head was made from material quarried in the high Italian Alps 6,500 to 5,500 years ago. It would have belonged to some of the first farmers to arrive in Britain.

It was found discarded along a raised wooden pathway, built 3,800 years ago by some of the first farmers, that traversed a marsh near Glastonbury, not far from Stonehenge. Its battered boards and supports are also part of the exhibit.A huge new prehistoric circle has been discovered near StonehengeOn display for the first time is a carved stone drum found in a child's grave that's billed as ""the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years."" It dates to 3005 BC-2890 BC, around the same time as initial construction of Stonehenge.The Schifferstadt gold hat dates from 1600 BC and was found in Germany. It's thought it could be a  cosmic calendar.  Credit: Kurt Diehl/Historisches Museum der Pfalz SpeyerAnother compelling object is Germany's Nebra sky disc -- thought to be the world's oldest depiction of the cosmos. It has only left the country four times. Like Stonehenge's alignment with the sun, the bands on either side mark the positions of the rising and setting sun, while the inlaid gold stars may represent a constellation that can help calculate a leap year. The exhibition also includes two conical gold hats that are thought to be cosmic calendars. ""These are inklings of astronomical knowledge that we are really surprised people had,"" Wilkin said.Despite the Nebra sky disc being found buried in Germany, it's now known the inlaid gold on the artifact is from Cornwall, England. Bodies buried in the monument's shadow also have revealed that Stonehenge was shaped by waves of immigration.

The iconic novella was penned by French author Antoine de Saint-Exupery in New York during World War II, and now 30 handwritten pages of the original manuscript are on display at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. The original manuscript sits alongside hundreds of other items that celebrate many facets of the author's life and work. They include watercolors, sketches, drawings, photographs, poems, newspaper clippings and correspondence.  The exhibit, ""An Encounter with the Little Prince,"" opened Wednesday at Paris' Museum of Decorative Arts. ""The exhibition is called 'An Encounter with the Little Prince' and the goal is to really encounter Little Prince,"" Thomas Rivière, great-grandnephew of Saint-Exupery, told CNN.  ""It's been a dream (of mine) for such a long time,"" Rivière added.Read MoreBorn in the French city of Lyon in 1900, Saint-Exupery was a writer, pilot and journalist who joined the French air force in 1940. That year, he flew to New York on a mission to persuade the United States to enter the war and fight alongside France.  While in the United States, he finished writing ""Le Petit Prince,"" which was eventually published in New York in 1943 in both English and French. Some 600 items related to ""The Little Prince"" are featured in the exhibition.The simple tale, which has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide, is about a child who travels the universe gaining wisdom. Since its initial publication, it has been translated into nearly 500 languages, according to the Museum of Decorative Arts, making it one of the most translated works in the world.The best books of 2021, according to global tastemakersSaint-Exupery, however, did not live to see that reach. He went missing while flying a mission in 1944 and was declared dead in 1945. It took Rivière, who is the head of Saint-Exupery's estate, three years to bring the exhibition to the public -- partly because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. His efforts were supported by publishers and collectors, including the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, which houses the manuscript.Photographs, poems and newspaper cuttings about the book are featured in the exhibition.Saint-Exupery wrote and drew on razor-thin paper nicknamed ""onion skin."" This made the task of transporting the pages of the manuscript, which were all the more fragile due to their age, even more challenging, Rivière said.To ensure their safe transportation, the pages were carefully and professionally framed in New York by the Morgan Library and Museum, he said.The exhibition opened February 17 and is set to run through June 26.

It has been updated.  (CNN)Obstructive sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time. The condition caused the death of Indian singer and composer Bappi Lahiri, who died on Tuesday in Mumbai, according to a statement from his doctor. He was 69. What are the warning signs of obstructive sleep apnea and what can you do about it? We asked sleep experts to explain.Snoring can be a key sign of obstructive sleep apnea -- but at some point in our lives, we all snore.  A cold or allergy can block nasal passages, a few drinks too close to bed will automatically relax tongue, palate and throat muscles -- and before we know it, we're unconsciously forcing air past soft tissues, causing vibrations that escape as a snore.""Snoring can be normal and not something to worry about,"" said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. Read More""When it's loud, raucous snoring, or it's interrupted by pauses in breathing, that's where we start to get concerned,"" Robbins said.It's estimated that at least 25 million Americans and 936 million people worldwide may suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, with many more undiagnosed.Sleep with your pet? How that may affect you (and your pet) 'It can be very, very scary'It's called ""obstructive"" sleep apnea because unlike central sleep apnea -- in which the brain occasionally skips telling the body to breathe -- obstructive sleep apnea is due to a blockage of the airways by weak, heavy or relaxed soft tissues.How to fall asleep more quickly -- the healthy way""You're making the effort with your belly and your chest to try to get the air in and out, but because of the obstruction in the upper airway, you can't. Often you aren't aware of this struggle, but it can be very, very scary for anyone watching,"" said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.If left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea puts you at high risk for hypertension, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes or depression, even an early death, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.How can you tell when your snoring has become dangerous to your health? Sleep experts use a sleep questionnaire with an easy-to-follow acronym: STOP BANG. S stands for snoringSnoring is a key indicator, so it's a no-duh that it leads the list of potential warnings signs. But this is no pitiful, whimpy snore, and certainly not a snore that anyone could ever call ""cute."" If your partner's snores can be heard though a closed door, it's time to see a sleep specialist.""We're talking loud, obnoxious snoring, the type that would drown out conversations or be heard through closed doors,"" Dasgupta said. ""Some of the very descriptive bed partners of my patients with obstructive sleep apnea describe their partners' snores as listening to a 'dying bear' or a scene from 'Jurassic Park,'"" he added.T stands for tiredBeing really tired during the day is a prime indicator of poor sleep. Combined with snoring, it can be a telltale symptom of sleep apnea. ""Daytime sleepiness is one of the strong predictors of sleep apnea,"" Robbins said.""Falling asleep anytime you have a moment -- sitting down for a break after lunch, in a movie theater -- those are all hallmark symptoms along with fatigue and taking the house down with your snores,"" said Robbins, who coauthored the book Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.O stands for 'observed'Many people -- if not most -- have no idea that they snore at night. Nor do they know they stop breathing during the night -- unless the blockage is so bad that they wake up gasping and choking. Recovering from a lack of sleep takes longer than you might think, study says""The O stands for observed apnea, and that's actually worse than just snoring,"" Dasgupta said. ""An apnea means no flow of air -- no air coming in no air going out. You're not breathing. Observed apnea is really a red flag.""Bed partners are often key to the identification of obstructive sleep apnea.""Watching your partner stop breathing, snore, cough or gasp for air are all signs the snoring might not be normal, and then it is something that deserves attention from a sleep specialist,"" Robbins said.P stands for pressure -- high blood pressureObstructive sleep apnea can lead to hypertension. Every time a person stops breathing for a few seconds, the body's sympathetic nervous system goes into action and raises blood pressure. In addition, the body releases stress hormones called catecholamines, which can also raise blood pressure over time. While having hypertension by itself is not a sign of a sleep disorder, it can be a warning sign when combined with other telltale signals. Fortunately, treatments for obstructive sleep apnea, like continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, have not only been shown to help with sleep apnea, but they also lower blood pressure.B stands for BMIBody mass index is a score commonly used to indicate levels of weight. To measure BMI, health professionals use height and weight data to track changes in weight relative to height. Your weight is considered normal if your BMI falls between 18.5 and 24.9. You are deemed overweight when your BMI is between 25 and 29.9 -- and a BMI of 30 or more indicates you are obese.Sleep hygiene: 8 ways to train your brain for better sleepPeople who are obese or extremely obese -- with a BMI of 35 and above -- are frequently found to suffer from obstructive sleep apnea because the extra weight in the mouth, tongue and neck collapses those soft tissues, making it more difficult to easily breathe without snoring.""Weight loss can be a big part of the recommendation from a health care provider for addressing sleep apnea,"" Robbins said. Obstructive sleep apnea has been on the rise around the world as obesity has reached epidemic proportions, but it wasn't seen as frequently before the 1970s, she added. ""In sleep medicine we joke that Humpty Dumpty was one of the first cases of obstructive sleep apnea because he had a big belly and probably extra tissue around the soft palate. He was at risk for falling asleep all the time and falling off the wall,"" Robbins said.""That was a nursery rhyme and at the time, an anomaly. But now, unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly common with the increased body mass index we're seeing across the country and the world,"" she added.A is for ageHow to get your teens to sleep now that they are back in schoolMuscle tone weakens as we age, including in our soft palate and neck. So being over age 50 is another potential signal that your snoring may be -- or turn into -- obstructive sleep apnea. There is some good news -- studies are beginning to find that sleep apnea in the elderly tends to be of a mild to moderate kind, with the more severe cases occurring at younger ages.N is for neckHaving a large neck circumference, either from being overweight or genetics, is also a key indicator of potential obstructive sleep apnea. ""Now you don't want to be a weirdo and start measuring your loved one's neck build at night,"" Dasgupta said. ""The rule of thumb is always going to be a collar size of greater than 17 inches (43 centimeters) for a male, and greater than 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) for a female will put you at a higher risk for sleep apnea.""G is for genderAre you a man? Then unfortunately, that, too, makes you at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Some of the reasons may be that men tend to have fatter tongues and carry more fat in their upper bodies than women, especially in the neck. Men also tend to have more ""belly fat,"" which can make breathing in general more difficult.""However, we definitely see a lot more obstructive sleep apnea in women after menopause,"" Dasgupta said.High-risk needs evaluationNow it's time to score your risk. Give yourself a point for every ""yes"" answer. If you scored between 5 and 8, you are at high risk of having obstructive sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a sleep specialist. Do you have social jet lag? Here's what to do""Sleep tests nowadays are much, much easier to get than in prior years when you could only go to a sleep lab,"" Dasgupta said. ""You don't have to be stuck in the lab with all these wires on you, looking like Frankenstein. You can do an at-home sleep test in your own bed, which is nice.""But don't ignore your symptoms, as the negative effects on health should not be ignored, says the American Academy of Sleep Medicine: ""Like a fire alarm, snoring is a warning of danger that demands your attention.""Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. If your score is between 0 and 2, your risk is obviously low, so snoring isn't likely to be a big concern for your health. A score of 3 to 4 puts you at an intermediate risk, but that doesn't mean you should ignore your symptoms, especially if you share your bed with a loved one, Dasgupta said.""It's always good to be a nice person, and if it affects your bed partner, I think it's worthwhile getting evaluated,"" he said. ""If your bed partner is wakened multiple times during the night by your snoring or can't fall asleep because of your snores, then that bed partner is going to be sleep deprived, and that is not good for their health. So it's not always about yourself.""TreatmentsThe treatment of choice for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. By pushing air into the lungs through a nose mask, the device helps keep the airway unobstructed throughout the night. The best alarm clocks of 2021 (CNN Underscored)Weight loss can significantly decrease -- or even eliminate obstructive sleep apnea, as the loss of tissue mass in the mouth, tongue and neck eases pressure on the airway. Doctors can also prescribe an oral appliance designed to enlarge the airway by moving the tongue or jaw forward.If anatomical issues, such as nasal polyps, enlarged tonsils or adenoids or a deviated septum, are contributing to the apnea, surgery may be recommended. Mild cases of sleep apnea may respond to ""positional therapy,"" a fancy way of saying keeping sleepers on their sides instead of back during sleep, which can improve airway flow and reduce snoring. ""I'm a big fan of simple, homemade solutions, such as sewing tennis balls into the back of pajamas to keep people from turning onto their backs,"" Dasgupta said.""You can get even more creative by putting a bra on someone in reverse and then putting tennis balls in in the cups,"" Robbins suggested.CNN's Katie Hunt contributed to this story."
Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/business/michelin-airless-tire/index.html,A next-generation Chevrolet could have airless tires,"By Peter Valdes-Dapena, CNN Business"," (CNN)Michelin has been working with General Motors to develop airless tires that will be sold on a next-generation Chevrolet Bolt electric car, expected to go on sale in the next few years, a Michelin executive said. It could mark the decline of over 130 years of tire tradition but also the end of one of the most annoying aspects of car ownership: keeping air in the tires.""We want to bring the next generation of the Chevrolet Bolt with airless tires,"" Alexis Garcin, president of Michelin North America said in an interview with CNN Business, ""and it's going to happen now in the next three to five years."" Michelin is developing airless tires for passenger cars. The tires, called Uptis, are being tested on GM cars, like the Chevrolet Bolt EV shown here.GM has not confirmed that it is working on a new car to be called the Chevrolet Bolt, the same name as the automaker's current EV, but GM has said it is working on a wide variety of electric vehicles including affordable ones similar to the Bolt in price. Michelin and GM have tested the airless tire on current-generation Bolt cars, though, something the companies have been open about. It's ironic that the first airless tire for passenger cars might come from the French tire maker whose famous mascot -- Bibendum, more popularly known as the Michelin Man -- is made from air-filled tires. The company made its name in the late 1800s with advancements to pneumatic (air-filled) tires for bicycles and was among the first to produce and market them for use on automobiles. In 1899, the first car to set a world speed record using pneumatic tires, a rocket-shaped electric car that went 66 miles an hour, did it on Michelins. The company has gone on to produce pneumatic tires used in other speed record attempts by companies like Bugatti.The disadvantages of filling tires with pressurized air are obvious. Air is a gas that can leak, and tires are vulnerable to punctures. Tire makers have spent over a century coming up with ways to minimize punctures and keep air inside these circular rubber tubes, but it still happens with some regularity.Read MoreMichelin's airless tire design relies on flexible ribs to provide a sort of spring action, roughly the same way air does in a pneumatic tire. If the tread gets punctured, it makes little difference since the tire doesn't hold in air. In fact, the sides of the airless tire are completely open.Of course, there are reasons airless tires haven't been used on passenger cars in over a century. Air does have its advantages. For one thing, pressurized air allows tires to be customized for specific uses. For instance, a driver taking a four-wheel-drive truck off-road might reduce the air pressure in the tires, which allows the tire to flatten out a bit creating a larger footprint area on loose sand or dirt. The tires can then be re-inflated when the truck goes back to driving on asphalt. Michelin is developing airless tires for passenger cars. The tires, called Uptis, are being tested on GM cars, like the Chevrolet Bolt EV.Also, car companies have been engineering cars and their suspension systems for a century with the idea that the vehicles would be riding on air-inflated tires. Airless tires could perform differently, presenting a challenge for car engineers.Michelin is trying to replicate as closely as possible the behavior of air-filled tires. Given the completely different structure of these tires compared to pneumatic ones it will be challenging to replicate that feel, said Ryan Pszczolkowski, who oversees tire testing at Consumer Reports. It's especially challenging given that pneumatic tires come in a wide variety and feel and behave differently from one another.""I mean, we're literally reinventing the wheel here,"" he said. Michelin already sells an airless tire, called the X Tweel, for use on lawnmowers and similar off-road equipment like ATVs. One X Tweel for a lawnmower -- it includes the tire and its integrated wheel, rather than the tire and wheel being separate -- can cost over $600, according the product website. But Michelin claims they last longer than pneumatic tires and offer a more a comfortable ride because they aren't as bouncy.But passenger car drivers are going to be pickier than lawnmower drivers about things like ride, handling and noise. Cars operate at much higher speeds and take corners much faster than off-road machinery. Michelin engineers have to replicate the feel and performance of pneumatic tires under this more demanding daily use.For these reasons, the passenger car version Michelin is developing, called the Uptis, has a different construction even though it looks almost the same as the X Tweel. The central ribs that hold it up are made from rubber reinforced with resin-injected fiberglass while the X Tweel's ribs are made with polyurethane, for instance.Garcin also envisions the tire incorporating other technological advancements. It will be completely recyclable and renewable -- it will easy to retread and reuse --  and it will have real-time connectivity so drivers will be able to easily monitor tread wear.Of course, any consumer acceptance of an airless tire will also depend on the cost. But its introduction on a next generation of Bolt, a car that starts just shy of $32,000, appears to indicate that airless tires won't be limited to the upper end of the marketBeyond this first electric car, the sheer variety of tire sizes and types already on the market will create its own challenges, said Pszczolkowski, as Michelin works to create airless tires for more vehicles.""It seems like every time a new vehicle comes out a new tire size is invented,"" he said. ""It's really maddening.""In the end, said Pszczolkowski, the success of airless tires really depends on how much trouble and expense consumers are willing to go to to avoid a flat tire."

From the ""Watermeids"" of South Africa depicted in Khoisan rock paintings (some of which are believed to date back 28,000 years) to the water spirit ""Mami Wata"" recognized in oral tradition across the continent and the African diaspora in the Americas, Black mermaids long predate Ariel. To help change the way we see the sea, Austrian Nigerian visual artist and photographer David Ụzọchukwu makes surreal fantasy portraiture that celebrates Black and Brown bodies.

""I'm slowly figuring out how I can weaponize my art for a cause.""Ụzọchukwu shot some of the images for the series on location in a coastal town in Senegal, a place from where, he says, people leave to make the journey to the Canary Islands and on to Europe -- often never to be seen again.Ụzọchukwu's series, ""Mare Monstrum,"" deals with the experience of Africans arriving in Europe in both modern and historical contexts. Pictured: ""Styx"", 2021. Credit: David Uzochukwu, Galerie Number 8""The series deals with the modern context of refugees. What I thought was interesting was these water metaphors used within the press: 'waves of refugees.' There was this idea of being 'flooded' by some sort of natural force,"" he explained. As European citizens, he realized, ""This human catastrophe is part of our responsibility and that sense of responsibility pushed me to pursue these themes.""Through his work, he hopes to disassemble some of the violence experienced by refugees from the African continent as they make the dangerous crossing to seek shelter on European shores -- and draw a parallel to the transatlantic slave trade.""Historically there are interesting links between water and Blackness in the Middle Passage [the forced voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to become slaves in the Americas],"" he added. ""It's really interesting to realize you're part of a tradition.""From self-portrait to surreal fantasyỤzọchukwu found his passion for image-making as a young teenager in Luxembourg. He initially took up the craft as a hobby to impress a love interest.As he grew up, photography became a means of understanding and processing his own identity.

""That's the first half of the process, getting that visual material,"" he explained.

Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/tech/apple-face-id-mask/index.html,We tested Apple's new option to unlock an iPhone while wearing a mask,"By Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)I stood outside a busy New York City subway stop recently, dressed like a celebrity trying not to be recognized. My face was covered with sunglasses, a baseball cap and my black KN95 mask. But my iPhone immediately recognized me as its rightful owner, without needing me to uncover my face. The device swiftly unlocked when I swiped up to use Face ID. For much of the past two years, many iPhone users, myself included, have lost some of the convenience of being able to seamlessly unlock the device with their face because they were masked. Apple's latest software update is intended to address that pandemic headache. The update, iOS 15.4, aims to ensure Face ID, one of the iPhone's signature features, works without requiring the phone's owner to remove their mask in public, a technical feat given the fewer facial details it has available to analyze. The new feature is still in beta and could launch to the public for iPhone 12 devices and newer in the weeks or months ahead. (The timing is perhaps a bit ironic considering many states are actively lifting mask mandates.)I downloaded an early version of the update and tested Face ID with a series of patterned masks, black K95 masks, masks with beards and even one with Kevin's face from the movie ""Home Alone."" Face ID worked with many of these on the first attempt, but the overall experience was inconsistent. I was often asked to type in my passcode after a failed attempt. Read MoreApple plans AirTag updates to curb unwanted trackingDespite unlocking the device while incognito in sunglasses and a hat on my first try, repeating this feat was also hit or miss. Apple later told me the software update is intended to work with eyeglasses but can work with sunglasses in certain situations, when Face ID can gather enough information to identify a user. It is, however, designed to work with a hat. The pairing of both worked about half of the time.While it's impressive the feature worked as often as it did, the mixed results highlight the challenge Apple (AAPL) and other tech companies must confront to enable users to unlock their devices with their faces -- a feature available on other smartphones as well -- when part of the user's face is concealed. Facial recognition software typically works by comparing measurements between different facial features in one image to those in one or more other images. Apple's Face ID tool compares a stored image of the smartphone owner's face with an image taken when they attempt to unlock the handset. Mask wearing pushed many companies — including Apple — to focus on better identifying and verifying people based on the portion of the face above the nose and, in particular, the eye region.The company said because Face ID with a mask uses less biometric information, there may be circumstances when a user is not as easily recognized as when their full face is visible and a user may therefore need to enter their passcode. Given the software is still in beta, Apple will likely be looking for information to refine the experience. Apple has tried other approaches to unlock the iPhone while wearing a mask. Last year, Apple rolled out a partial solution allowing anyone with an Apple Watch to use the device to authenticate their identity without taking off their mask. Still, there were limitations: the devices had to be in close proximity; you still needed to type in a passcode to make transactions through Apple Pay, the App Store or iTunes if wearing a mask; and obviously, you needed to own an Apple Watch.Rachel Metz contributed to this story."

The game had multiple rounds and the owner's voice was paired with 14 different strangers' voices.The dogs found their owner in 82% of cases, researchers said in the press release.To make sure the dogs were guided by voice alone, and not their sense of smell, in the last two rounds the researchers played the owner's voice from where the stranger hid.The dogs still went to where their owners' voices were coming from, indicating that they did not use their noses in the task.""Dogs' high choosing success rate, their ability to discriminate their owner's voice from a variety of control voices, and the fact that dogs' choices were not confounded by either olfactory cues or speaker order indicate that dogs can reliably use identity cues carried by speech,"" the researchers wrote in the study.Tamás Faragó, senior researcher at the Department of Ethology, Eötvös Loránd University, told CNN Thursday that it could be viewed as ""surprising"" that dogs would not rely more on their sense of smell in such an experiment.Sorry, folks -- your dog doesn't really know what you're talking about ""Probably in a lot of cases dogs have to switch on their nose to find things and they don't just use it routinely all the time,"" he said.Faragó and his team also explored what exactly in the voices helped dogs to know where their owners were, and found that dogs make use of some of the same voice properties as humans to recognize who is talking. These properties include pitch (higher or lower), noisiness (cleaner or harsher), and timbre (brighter or darker).If the owner's and the stranger's voice differed more in pitch and noisiness it helped dogs to recognize their owner's voice, researchers found, whereas timbre and other sound properties did not help the dogs to differentiate between their owner and a stranger.The study's findings could mean dogs may be able to identify their owner's voice over the phone, Faragó said.""This can be important for dogs who have separation anxiety,"" he said, adding this could be a ""real world application"" of the team's findings.""Of course, usually, the dogs meet in person with humans so that they can differentiate us by our looks, and also the smell, and they use all these things, but there are more and more research and technology going into this direction.""The study was published in the Animal Cognition journal February 10."
Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/tech/eviation-ceo-exit/index.html,World's first electric plane start up parts ways with CEO in mysterious rift,"By Jennifer Korn, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)Eviation, the company behind what is supposed to be the world's first all-electric passenger airplane, has undergone an unexpected change in leadership just before the plane's projected first flight -- and the company and the now-former CEO are offering different takes on the situation. Eviation, an Israel-based company, has said it plans three versions of its all-electric plane: a ""commuter"" variant holding nine passengers and two pilots, an executive version holding six passengers, and one specialized for cargo. The company has said the nine-passenger version, which it calls ""Alice,"" will be able to fly for one hour and about 440 nautical miles after 30 minutes of charging. Eviation initially aimed for the Alice to take flight before 2022, but said poor weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest at the end of the year had hindered testing. The Alice has been undergoing several taxi tests since late 2021, and last month then-CEO Omer Bar-Yohay told CNN Business that its first flight was ""just weeks away."" Bar-Yohay did not mention an impending CEO shift at that time.On Monday, Bar-Yohay, who was also a co-founder of Eviation, left the company after seven years, and he was replaced by interim CEO and current Eviation president Gregory Davis. The company says the change is part of a ""planned succession process"" as Eviation shifts from planning to production of the Alice, according to a statement. An executive search process is underway to fill the CEO position long-term, it said. But Bar-Yohay said that while it is time for a new direction, his departure is the result of a dispute within the company. Read More""This is definitely part of a natural progression. It is time for the company to turn a corner and really transition from proving our prototype to manufacturing,"" Bar-Yohay told CNN Business. ""That said, there is a long-standing disagreement about how and what exactly does the company need to do going forward, and that created some friction between myself and the main shareholder of the company."" Bar-Yohay declined to answer questions as to the nature of the disagreement. While Bar-Yohay said the change is not a big shock, he had not been aware of how and when it would be announced. Alice, the first all-electric passenger airplane, prepares to fly Eviation's main shareholder is Richard Chandler, the New Zealand-born billionaire owner of the Clermont Group. The Singapore-based Clermont Group includes MagniX, Eviation's sister company and propulsion provider. Just last month, Eviation executive chairman and MagniX CEO Roei Ganzarski stepped down from both roles. ""I do believe some of the underlying reasons [for our departures] are similar,"" Bar-Yohay said. ""There was no way to make this go any differently."" The Clermont Group has not responded to multiple requests for comment.Though Ganzarski has not commented on the reasons behind his own departure from both companies, he made the announcement last month ""with a heavy heart,"" according to a post on his LinkedIn. ""I have no doubt that the future of aviation is electric. It has to be for the sake of our children and grandchildren. It is no longer a question of if, but only when and who. I leave magniX and Eviation positioned to continue their leadership in this field.""Ganzarski did not comment when asked if his exit was due to the same circumstances Bar-Yohay describes. ""Omer did a tremendous job building a leading aerospace company and phenomenal aircraft with very limited resources,"" Ganzarski told CNN Business when asked about the leadership change. ""I am very proud of what he and his team did.""Bar-Yohay will remain involved with Eviation as a board member and investor moving forward, he has said."

Changing that can't be a one-man fight,"Analysis by Brandon Tensley, CNN","Washington (CNN)A version of this story appeared in CNN's Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here.Hip-hop took center stage during a glorious and historic Super Bowl halftime show last Sunday, yet the lineup felt at least a little bit strange, given that the NFL is in the thick of another controversy over race and racism.During the show, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Dr. Dre, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar put on a dynamic spectacle that reminded audiences that hip-hop and its apostles have always grappled with questions of race and power. For instance, Eminem ended his 2002 anthem ""Lose Yourself"" by taking a knee -- a clear reproduction of Colin Kaepernick's protest against anti-Black police brutality. And Dr. Dre reiterated that he's ""still not lovin' police.""Yet the performance arrived at a moment when the NFL is being forced to examine racial hierarchies within its own orbit. Indeed, the league has a history of ""doing things only when absolutely forced,"" the journalist Jemele Hill told CNN.Brian Flores, the former head coach of the Miami Dolphins who was fired at the close of the 2021 season, has filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the NFL as well as three of its franchises, alleging racial discrimination.Read MoreThe NFL has hired former US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who was the country's first Black woman attorney general, as part of its defense council in the lawsuit, the league announced on Wednesday.While the majority of players in the NFL are Black, most head coaches are White. Currently, there are two Black head coaches: the Pittsburgh Steelers' Mike Tomlin, and the Houston Texans' Lovie Smith.""Biased decision-making, organizational cultures that value similarity, and societal forms of bias and discrimination are all to blame for the lack of diversity among NFL head coaches,"" the Texas A&M University professor George B. Cunningham, whose research focuses largely on diversity and inclusion in sport and physical activity, recently wrote for The Conversation. ""Until structural change occurs, the pattern will continue.""Crucially, this exclusionary pattern has consequences.""Organizational scholars have consistently shown that people are most likely to hire others who are of the same race. Bias among decision-makers can affect the diversity of the organization,"" Cunningham noted.The sports sociologist and civil rights activist Harry Edwards echoed some of Cunningham's sentiments, saying on Twitter that the controversy currently gripping the NFL ought to come as no surprise, given the league's history: The modern NFL didn't have a Black head coach until 1989, when Art Shell took over the position for the Los Angeles Raiders.""It most certainly can't be claimed that nobody saw this coming,"" Edwards said.To discuss the NFL's most recent crisis, I spoke with Hill, who's joining CNN+ this spring to co-host a weekly show with Cari Champion. During our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, Hill and I talked about some of the limitations of the Rooney Rule that requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching jobs and certain other top positions, the necessity of broad support for Flores so that he's not in a one-man fight and the role that shaming can play in fueling change.Why is all of this coming to a head now, when the league has long had biased hiring practices?I think because we have litigation. And it came to a head in a similar way before. That's how we got the Rooney Rule. It was Johnnie Cochran (and Cyrus Mehri) back in 2002 who threatened to sue the NFL after Tony Dungy was fired, though he had a winning record. (Dennis Green also was fired, following his first losing season in a decade.)That's basically what forced the NFL owners to address the lack of Black people being hired for coaching jobs and also address the fact that there were instances where Black coaches had a winning record and were fired.So, what's happening right now isn't new. And unfortunately, the NFL has a history -- much like the rest of America -- of doing things only when absolutely forced. It never does anything out of the goodness of its heart. It usually has to come from outside pressure. And this is just another example of how litigation has once again brought the league to a reckoning.Are we seeing the limits of the Rooney Rule?One way to look at this is through the Civil Rights Act. We know what the law said and what it attempted to do, and yet institutional racism is still very much present. So, laws and procedures and guidelines -- they're only going to go so far. What they can never fully address is the fact that the US has been embedded in an institutionally racist system -- the system being every corner of society -- for so long that waiting it out with just legislation is not possible. Confronting the issue requires a lot of different tactics. A rule is just one of them.How 'The Kaepernick Effect' has propelled a new generation of athletes to take a stand against racial injusticeI think that the people who believed that the Rooney Rule was going to fix everything were being naive. Because if the Civil Rights Act, if the Voting Rights Act, if Brown v. the Board of Education couldn't fix everything in the US, why would the Rooney Rule be able to fix everything in the NFL?It has to be more than just a rule. It has to be a mentality, an attitude, an approach. It also has to be intentionality among those with the most power. They have to be willing to do things that will topple the system that's been built. And the reality is that -- and it sounds harsh to say out loud -- there are more people invested in racism than anti-racism. As long as there are more who are invested in racism, we're always going to get stops and starts when it comes to progress.What will it take for Flores' lawsuit to create deeper change, then?It's going to require people who have things to lose to put it all on the line. Flores is a young guy and can be a head coach. He's basically put his career on the line. But he can't be the only one. If this lawsuit is just Flores versus the NFL, it's not going to get where it should.This is going to require every Black coach with a stake in the game to join Flores, whether you feel like you've been directly influenced or not. I'm guessing that the majority of them can speak to a lot of the things in the lawsuit. But as we see with progress elsewhere, shaming works. The NFL does not want this to stay in the headlines. It doesn't want this lawsuit to really see the light of day in terms of it actually going to trial. There's a discovery process. The NFL doesn't want that.That's why all of these coaches really need to band together, because the NFL can't blackball everybody. Flores is unlikely to get a job with the way things are going in the NFL. But if 20 or 30 coaches join him, do you think that they (the NFL) are going to blackball everybody? They're not. And if they did, they know how that would look.The fact that we all openly say and know that Flores is unlikely to get a head coaching job is a problem. And the NFL should be ashamed of that. But we're saying it like we're saying water is wet, and that, to me, really crystallizes everything that's wrong with the NFL. So again, this can't be a one-man fight. It has to be a team fight, to use football language. And if it's not a team fight, the lawsuit doesn't have a chance to make the kind of impact that's required for this system to be different for the next generation of Black coaches.Is there anything you think people tend to miss in conversations about the NFL and race?Racism is always treated as unintentional, when the entire system was designed for it to work that way. The NFL was designed to not have Black men as leaders. That's why it took so long for Black quarterbacks to be a thing. And now we're on the next level of that with coaches. The system was never designed in a way that included having Black people in power.And so people need to understand that this is not a matter of, ""The NFL just so happens to not have very many Black coaches."" This is how it was supposed to be. Once you understand the intentionality of the system, you can take it with the seriousness that's required and keep the NFL under the scrutiny that it deserves."
Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/random-acts-of-kindness-day-2022-wellness/index.html,The health benefits of a random act of kindness,"By Sandee LaMotte, CNN"," (CNN)This year's Random Acts of Kindness Day falls during a pandemic for a second year in a row, but the foundation behind it wants you to consider being kind every day.They want you to be a ""RAKtivist,"" or a ""Random Acts of Kindness activist.""Here's why: Spreading kindness not only helps others feel better about themselves -- it can also boost the giver's health and happiness, according to research. It's a win-win for all. Here's why.A 'helper's high'Putting the well-being of others before our own without expecting anything in return -- or what is called being altruistic -- stimulates the reward centers of the brain, studies show. Those feel-good chemicals flood our system, producing a sort of ""helper's high."" Volunteering, for example, has been shown to minimize stress and improve depression. Being happier will help you live longer, so learn how to be happierRead MoreThat's not all: The same activity can also reduce the risk for cognitive impairment and even help us live longer.One reason for this, experts say, is because kindness contributes to our sense of community and belonging. And that, studies have found, is a key contributor to a healthy, longer life.Lower blood pressureGiving donations to others, or ""prosocial spending,"" has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health. One study asked a group of hypertensive people to spend $40 on themselves, while another group of people with high blood pressure were told to spend the money on others. Why being an optimist is good for your heart They found that those who spent money on others had lower blood pressure at the end of the six-week study. In fact, the benefits were as large as those from healthy diet and exercise. Pain reductionGiving seems to lessen our pain. A recent study found that people who said they would donate money to help orphans were less sensitive to an electric shock than those who declined to give. In addition, the more helpful people thought their donation would be, the less pain they felt.How could this happen? The study found that regions of the brain that react to painful stimulation appear to be instantly deactivated by the experience of giving.HappinessIn the UK, researchers found that being kind could boost happiness in as little as three days. The study assigned people to three groups: the first group had to do an act of kindness each day; the second group tried a new activity; and the third group did nothing. The groups who were kind and did novel things saw a significant boost in happiness.Spreading kindness doesn't have to be complicated. You'll experience even greater joy if you're creative with your acts of kindness. Happiness researchers Sonja Lyubomirsky and Kennon Sheldon found that people who did a variety of acts of kindness throughout the week showed greater increases in happiness than those who performed the same activity over and over again. And here's the good news: It seems acts of kindness can be anonymous or visible, spontaneous or planned, and can be as simple as giving a compliment or opening a door for someone.Kindness suggestionsOK, you're convinced and want to jump right into being a kinder and more helpful person. There are literally hundreds of ideas on the internet, but here are a few to get you started:While driving, make room for the car that wants to enter your lane. Give a genuine compliment to a family member, friend or colleague (via text, email or video chat, please). Do the same for your boss -- they probably never get compliments!Let go of a grudge and tell that person you forgive them (unless telling them makes it worse).Be there for a friend having a tough time. Don't try to fix it; just listen.Leave your mail carrier a thank you note. Overtip your delivery person.But I'm so tiredThat's more than fair. Many people are overworked or have lost their jobs during the pandemic and are so worried about their children and their elderly relatives. Consider being kind to yourself (whatever that means) in the midst of this chaos. We all need a break. Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep. Want more ideas? The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation also has lists of kindness ideas, organized by work, community, environment, animals, strangers, kids, seniors and more. If you become a ""RAKtivist,"" you'll get a monthly kindness challenge designed to help a worthy cause or individual. ""You're making the world a better place,"" they say. But don't forget -- any kindness you give to others is also a gift to yourself.This updated story was originally published on February 17, 2020. "
Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/us-russia-ukraine-thursday/index.html,US says Russia plans to manufacture justification for war,"By Jeremy Herb, Veronica Stracqualursi, Kylie Atwood and Ellie Kaufman, CNN"," (CNN)US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia was laying the groundwork to justify starting a war and preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine in the coming days, urging Moscow to change course at a tense United Nations Security Council meeting Thursday.Blinken changed his travel plans so he could speak Thursday's UN meeting, where the top US diplomat said he was detailing US intelligence about Russia's attempts to fabricate a pretext for an invasion in an attempt to ""influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there's still time."" ""I am here today not to start a war, but to prevent one,"" Blinken said. The United States says evidence at Ukraine's border shows that Russia is ""moving towards an imminent invasion"" and is not withdrawing troops, despite Moscow's claims. The comments from Blinken and other top US officials Thursday -- including President Joe Biden's blunt warning that he believed an attack would happen ""within the next several days"" -- marked an even greater sense of urgency from the Biden administration that Russia's actions indicated the Kremlin was moving forward with plans for war. ""Every indication that we have is that they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine,"" Biden told reporters as he left the White House on Thursday.Read MoreBiden: 'Every indication' is that Russia will attack Ukraine 'within the next several days'Russia once again dismissed the notion it was preparing to attack Ukraine as ""baseless accusations."" In his address to the Security Council, Blinken laid out several steps the US expected Russia to take in the coming days in an attempt to justify military action in Ukraine. He said Moscow was likely to try to generate a pretext for the war, which could be a fabricated terrorist bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery of a mass grave or a staged drone strike. ""Russia may describe this event as ethnic cleansing or a genocide, making a mockery of a concept that we in this chamber do not take lightly,"" Blinken said.Blinken said that top Russian officials were likely to hold urgent meetings before an attack that would include Russian bombings across Ukraine and cyberattacks. Blinken said the US believes Moscow has already selected targets that Russian tanks and troops would advance on, including Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.Blinken acknowledged ""that some have called into question our information,"" nodding to past problems with US intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq War. But he said the US would be relieved if it's predictions are proven incorrect and Russia changes course.""The information I presented here is validated by what we've seen unfolding in plain sight before our eyes for months,"" Blinken said. ""Remember that while Russia has repeatedly regarded our warnings as melodrama and nonsense, they've been steadily amassing more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders.""Russia accuses US of making 'baseless accusations'Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey Vershinin, who spoke before Blinken at Thursday's Security Council meeting, warned others about making the UN meeting a ""circus,"" saying they should not present ""baseless accusations saying that Russia allegedly was going to attack Ukraine.""""We have long ago clarified everything and explained everything. And the announced date of this so-called invasion is behind us, so therefore ... my advice to you is [to] not present yourself in an awkward situation,"" Vershinin said.On Thursday, the US received a response from Russia to the written proposals the US submitted to Russia three weeks ago, a senior State Department official said. In an 11-page document published by state news agency RIA-Novosti, Moscow said the US did not provide a constructive response and that ""the increasing US and NATO military activity close to Russian borders is alarming."" ""It's about giving up the further expansion of NATO,"" the response said.As tensions continued to ratchet up, the State Department said Thursday that Russia expelled the second-most senior diplomat at the US embassy in Moscow without any justification, in what the Biden administration views as an escalatory move.  Gorman departed Moscow last week, according to a senior State Department official. He was expelled by Moscow earlier this year and given two weeks to depart. ""Russia's actions against our deputy chief of mission, who was a key member of the embassy's leadership team, was unprovoked,"" White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""Now more than ever, it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments.""addressing the UN because ""this is a crucial moment.""US says Moscow has expelled deputy chief of mission at US embassy Moscow in 'escalatory' move""The evidence on the ground is that Russia is moving towards an imminent invasion,"" she said. ""Our goal is to convey the gravity of the situation,"" she said.Blinken said that he proposed in a letter a meeting next week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Europe to continue diplomacy, along with meetings of the NATO-Russia council and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.US says Russian still adding troops and capabilities on Ukraine's borderUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Thursday also said the US government is not seeing any kind of withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's border, instead seeing Russia adding to its capabilities and troops ""even in the last couple of days.""During a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Austin said the US is seeing Russia move some troops closer to the border, fly in more combat and support aircraft, stock up on blood supplies and ""sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea.""""I was a soldier myself not that long ago, and I know firsthand that you don't do these sort of things for no reason, and you certainly don't do them if you're getting ready to pack up and go home, so we and our allies will stay vigilant,"" he said Thursday.Russia has rockets and artillery arrayed in a way that can target cities and other concentrated population areas, according to a US official.The US has been flying aerial surveillance over Ukraine for some time now, using a combination of RC-135 Rivet Joints and RQ-4 Global Hawks, as part of its intelligence gathering efforts. Those flights have continued, even as concerns of an invasion have grown.Echoing comments from Biden and other administrations officials, the US official said the Russians have everything in place to conduct a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, far more than is needed if the goal was only to target the Ukrainian military.The official did not say Putin has made a final decision to invade and noted he could call troops back any time he wants, but warned, ""Everything we see speaks to intent."" In trying to figure out Putin's next move, the US is looking at the total environment in eastern Europe -- from renewed fighting in Donbas to the false flag operations to the Russian disinformation campaign -- and comparing that to the latest intelligence to connect those elements as a possible pretext for an invasion. But it is imprecise work and not possible to draw out an absolute conclusion about whether or when Putin will move in. Still, there is growing confidence in Putin's eventual move. The official said the US is seeing preparations that already show the ""intentions to do military operations.""In eastern Ukraine, monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported a sharp escalation in ceasefire violations along the frontlines dividing Ukrainian and separatist forces. Both Ukrainian armed forces and separatists controlling parts of eastern Ukraine spoke of renewed shelling in the region early Thursday. Video and images confirmed by CNN show that a kindergarten in Ukrainian-controlled territory was hit by a shell Thursday.In a statement on Twitter, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said the village of Stanytsia Luhanska ""was shelled with heavy weapons from the occupied territory of the Donbas. Kuleba accused Russian-backed separatists of using a tank to carry out artillery fire in eastern Ukraine.

This diplomatic issue comes to the fore amid growing concerns about a Russian invasion of Ukraine and President Joe Biden's warning on Thursday that the US has ""every indication"" that Russia plans to attack Ukraine ""in the next several days.""A US State Department spokesperson on Thursday confirmed Russia had expelled Gorman and said the action was ""unprovoked.""Read MoreBlinken says Russia plans to manufacture justification for invasion as he urges Moscow 'to abandon the path of war'""We consider this an escalatory step and are considering our response,"" the spokesperson said. Russia has continually forced the US to reduce the size of its diplomatic footprint in the country in recent years. Gorman had been in Russia fewer three years with a valid visa and his tour had not ended, the spokesperson said, also noting that Gorman is a key member of the embassy's senior leadership team.""We call on Russia to end its baseless expulsions of US diplomats and staff and to work productively to rebuild our missions,"" the spokesperson said. The White House on Thursday echoed the State Department's assessment that this was an ""escalatory step"" and was ""unprovoked.""""Now more than ever, it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments,"" White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One.CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi and Betsy Klein contributed to this report."

But the images of a shelled kindergarten in eastern Ukraine shifted international focus to the Donbas region, where the world braced itself for signs that the simmering conflict there might escalate very seriously and catastrophically.    Thankfully, the shell that hit the Stanytsia Luhanska school took no lives. But they were a reminder of the very real stakes for people living near the Line of Contact that separates Ukrainian government forces from Russian-backed separatists.   For weeks, world leaders have been shuttling back and forth to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and making high-level phone calls to try to put the brakes on a confrontation between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis.   Yet in Moscow today, there's been no signs of a breakthrough, but a clear ratcheting up of tension. On Thursday afternoon local time, US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan paid a visit to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he received a long-awaited response from the Russian government to a written document delivered to Russia three weeks earlier.  Is Putin creating a pretext for war? The document made clear that the Russians laid full blame on the US and its allies for stoking the Ukraine crisis, even as evidence continues to mount of that as many as 150,000 Russian troops are arrayed around Ukraine's borders.   Read More""There is no plan for a 'Russian invasion' of Ukraine, as the U.S. and its allies have been alleging at the official level since last Autumn,"" the document, released by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti said. ""Therefore, claims about 'Russian culpability for the escalation' cannot be interpreted as anything other than an attempt to pressure and devalue Russian offers of security guarantees.""  At about the same time, the US State Department confirmed Russia had expelled the second-most senior diplomat at the US diplomatic mission in Moscow, a move that US President Joe Biden's administration called an ""escalatory"" step.That escalation has clearly been incremental: A senior State Department official said that Bart Gorman, the US deputy chief of mission in Moscow was formally expelled by Moscow earlier this year, given two weeks to depart and left Moscow last week.   So where does that leave diplomacy? It's still not entirely dead. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Thursday with his Italian counterpart, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Lavrov essentially laid out the same complaint that was in the written reply delivered to the US: The Americans and NATO have ignored Russia's core security concerns, he said, and none of the secondary issues  -- on the technical details of arms control, for instance  --  can be resolved ""until we agree on our key positions.""   And on those key positions, particularly regarding the issue of who can join NATO, Russia and the West remain very, very far apart.   "

That argument ""completely misses the mark,"" Engoron wrote in the order issued Thursday afternoon. He noted that the Trumps have the right to refuse to answer specific questions in the civil probe, as Eric Trump did when he sat for a deposition in the investigation.Engoron also excoriated the Trump Organization for claiming that James' investigation is now moot because the former President's longtime accounting firm, MazarsUSA, recently determined that the last 10 years of financial statements it prepared were unreliable.Read More""The idea that an accounting firm's announcement that no one should rely on a decade's worth of financial statements it issued based on the numbers submitted by an entity somehow exonerates that entity and renders an investigation into its past practices as moot is reminiscent of Lewis Carroll ('When I use a word, Humpty Dumpty said ... it means just what I chose it to mean -- neither more nor less'); George Orwell ('War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength'): and 'alternative facts,'"" Engoron wrote.""To proclaim that that Mazars' red-flag warning that the Trump financial statements are unreliable suddenly renders the OAG's longstanding investigation moot is as audacious as it is preposterous,"" the judge added.What to know about accounting firm Mazars' move to back away from TrumpThe ruling is the latest in a string of of legal defeats suffered by the former President, as he seeks to fend off investigations and lawsuits entangling his business. The Trump Organization was recently reinstated as a defendant in a case brought by the DC Attorney General Karl Racine, who is alleging the funds for Trump's 2017 inauguration were misused. In the DC case, a judge ruled Thursday that former Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg will have to sit for a deposition by Racine's lawyers.In the New York case, Engoron ordered the Trumps to sit for depositions within 21 days of his order, and the judge gave the former President 14 days comply with the attorney general's demands for certain documents and records.""In the final analysis, a State Attorney General commences investigating a business entity, uncovers copious evidence of possible financial fraud, and wants to question, under oath, several of the entities' principles, including its namesake,"" Engoron wrote. ""She has the clear right to do so.""Ronald Fischetti, attorney for former President Donald Trump, told CNN after the ruling came down that he will appeal the decision and seek a stay of the order.""We lost before we argued,"" said Fischetti. ""I told my client that so I had no hope whatsoever that this judge would give us the relief that we wanted."" The lawyer for Trump's children, Alan Futerfas, noted to CNN comments he made during Thursday's hearing signaling they were likely appeal an unfavorable ruling.In a statement after the ruling, James said that ""justice prevailed.""""No one will be permitted to stand in the way of the pursuit of justice, no matter how powerful they are. No one is above the law,"" she said.Fiery hearingDuring Thursday's hearing, Engoron asked why the Trumps couldn't just invoke the Fifth Amendment's protections against self-incrimination and refuse to answer specific questions. ""Can't they refuse to answer? Isn't that what Eric Trump did 500 times?"" the judge said, referring to a deposition that Trump's son already gave in the investigation. RELATED: Takeaways and new details from the New York AG's investigation into Trump's business empireIn their efforts to quash the subpoenas, the Trumps' lawyers argued that if James wants their testimony, she should bring them before a grand jury where they could be granted immunity.Judge rules DC AG can question former Trump Organization CFO in inaugural committee suitThe lawyers pointed to a separate criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney that is underway, and they emphasized the coordination between that office and James's office.Fischetti, who is representing Trump in the district attorney's criminal investigation, argued that if the former President was forced to invoke the Fifth Amendment, it would be on the front page of every newspaper and would taint the jury pool if a criminal case was brought against Trump.The former President also had filed a request to freeze James' investigation altogether, saying she's engaged in a political and selective prosecution and is improperly biased against him. The judge was skeptical of those arguments as well, pushing back on claims from Trump's lawyer Alina Habba that the attorney general was discriminating against Trump on the basis of his political views.Unspooling the latest twists in special counsel John Durham's investigation Habba at one point said the attorney general's office should be asked whether it intends to investigate Hillary Clinton for supposedly spying on Trump Tower -- a reference to a recent legal filing in special counsel John Durham's investigation that has been mischaracterized by conservative media.The judge however did note that James has made sensational public comments as both a candidate and in office, vowing to investigate Trump. ""It's arguably a circus that she's done,"" the judge said.This story has been updated with additional details.CNN's Sonnet Swire contributed to this report."
