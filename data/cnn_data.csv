The Mexican player explained how he came to the decision that a nine-iron would be the perfect club for his tee shot, and it proved a smart decision as his ball trickled into the hole from 178 yards.Coming on the par-three 16th hole, which is famous for its electric atmosphere due to the stadium-like seating, Ortiz's ace sparked raucous celebrations. A general view of the 16th hole during the third round of the Phoenix Open.Ortiz high-fived his playing partner Kevin Kisner and his caddie as the surrounding crowd showered the players and everyone else in beer and cans. And while the atmosphere was boisterous, Ortiz says one of those stray cans thrown in celebration happened to strike him. Read More""It was unbelievable. I didn't know how to react,"" Ortiz told reporters as he reflected on hitting the 11th all-time hole-in-one on the 16th at the Phoenix Open. ""A lot of people cheering for you and then you start trying to watch out for your head because I got actually nailed pretty hard on the back with a beer can, and then after that I was just trying to just avoid all the cans I could,"" added Ortiz, who then eagled the 17th.The 30-year-old golfer said it was the first time in his professional career he had hit an ace and then an eagle on successive holes.Ortiz described the ""vibe"" on the 16th, 17th and 18th holes as ""unbelievable"" and ""unique,"" but he wouldn't want to play in that atmosphere every week. ""It would be tiring,"" Ortiz told reporters. ""Especially once they get drunk they get a little rowdy and start saying the wrong things.""Ortiz hits his second shot on the second hole during the third round of the Phoenix Open.Raining holes-in-oneThe announcer on the TV coverage of the Phoenix Open said after Ortiz's ball rolled in: ""It's raining in the desert again!""CNN has reached out to the PGA Tour to ask for comment on the issue and to ask what steps does it plan to take -- if any -- to prevent this happening at future events.

As much as 92-feet from the hole, off the front of the green and a shot behind leader Bubba Watson, it looked like Harold Varner III's opportunity to win had slipped away. A par would mean Watson wins. A birdie would take it to a playoff. An eagle, while improbable, would give Varner the win. With his trusty putter in hand, Varner went to work as if he was a magician.

""A guy I truly love,"" Watson said of Varner, describing him as a ""dear friend.""""A guy that I want to help,"" continued Watson. ""He's new -- when I say new, we know Harold, but it took me -- it was five years until I won my first. ""So, this is a guy that's just starting to play better and better each year.

The three-time major winner took those recovery skills to another level at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in Saturday's third round in what proved to be a bit of a cliffhanger.After his drive on the par-four eighth hole landed precariously near the edge of a cliff, rather than taking a drop to move his ball -- that would have cost a shot -- Spieth decided to take it on. Harold Varner III sinks monster eagle putt on final hole to win the 2022 Saudi InternationalHe addressed and readdressed the ball a few times, adjusting his footing to ensure his stance was stable. And despite the almost 70-foot drop just inches in front of him, Spieth connected cleanly with the ball, quickly moving himself back from the edge of the cliff as soon as he'd made contact.

Like Michael (Greller) said afterwards: 'I should have grabbed the ball and thrown it in the water' because he was trying to get me not to hit it. I was like: 'Michael, please don't walk up there' because then he would've seen definitely not to hit it. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos""It was awfully close. I've never had a life and death situation on a shot before. So I thought I wouldn't really have nerves the rest of the day after that one.""Remarkably, Spieth was able to salvage a par from the hole, with the perilous shot landing just over the green. From there, he was able to chip onto the green and roll home a 10-foot par for par. Spieth is known for taking on shots from awkward lies. A clip of him hitting an almost vertical shot at the Ryder Cup last year -- after which, he almost ran into Lake Michigan -- went viral. "

Between a smiley disposition and his 'business at the front, party at the back' haircut, Smith has become somewhat of a fan favorite. Meanwhile over the last two years, the 28-year-old Smith has also blossomed into a serial contender or winner. He began 2022 in red-hot fashion, winning the Tournament of Champions in historic fashion earlier in January, posting the lowest under-par score in a four-round PGA Tour event in history to hold off world No. 1 Jon Rahm. Read MoreAfterwards, he was asked in his press conference why his personality hasn't changed over the years, especially in light of his recent success in golf. The reporter described his personality as ""everyman if you will, for the Americans, or just the solid true-blue bloke that you've been able to maintain.""And his response was reassuringly ""everyman."" ""There's no real reason to change my personality,"" Smith said. ""I think my dad would whip me to be honest if I did. ""I don't know, it's just how I've been brought up. I've been brought up to be the modest guy that respects everyone and like even out there today, Johnny was great as well. ""Every time we made a putt or a birdie, it was: 'Good shot, mate' or there was never any hatred towards each other just because we were competing. ""We wanted to win because we wanted to compete against the best.

Smith is shown during second round play in the Tour Championship in 2021.WinningSince winning his first PGA Tour event in May 2017 at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans -- partnered with Jonas Blixt -- Smith has become one of the steadiest players in golf. He then won back-to-back Australian PGA Championships in 2017 and 2018 on the European Tour. It's over the last two years that Smith has really gone to the next level. A playoff victory at the Sony Open in January 2020 was his first individual victory on the PGA Tour before he achieved his best finish at a major to date, finishing tied for second behind Dustin Johnson at the Masters in 2020. Smith also became the first golfer in Masters history to shoot all four rounds in the 60s.He once again won the Zurich Classic of New Orleans in 2021, this time partnered with countryman Marc Leishman, while Smith finished tied for 10th competing at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. After hitting his straps towards the end of the 2020-21 PGA Tour season, Smith began the new year in the perfect fashion with his record-breaking win in Maui, something he attributes to an improvement in his driving. Smith carries his own golf bag as his caddie cleans the fairway bunker on the second hole during the third round of the Masters in 2021.He says he spent time on the driving range during the offseason practicing with his driver.When asked about what he worked on to improve his driving, Smith said: ""It really wasn't much. Probably just hitting more balls with a driver to be honest.""I'm not lazy. Actually, I guess I'm lazy on the range. I get through the wedges and the irons and I'm like: 'I'm ready to go home now.' I barely hit drivers. So I made sure I stayed there for an extra 10-15 minutes and actually hit some balls."" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosThe result has been Smith's meteoric rise up the world rankings and into the top 10 for the first time in his career. One of his goals for the rest of the year is qualify and lead the International President Cup Team which will face the US team at Quail Hollow in September. ""I definitely want to be on that team,"" Smith said. ""I enjoyed the tournament so much last time that I would be devastated if I missed out. And it's been one of my goals since I've turned pro to be on the team, and I'll try and be there again."" "

The Kiwi player has won two majors, as well as becoming the youngest player ever to win a professional golf tour event aged just 14. In 2015, when she was just 17 years, nine months and nine days of age, Ko also became the youngest men's or women's player to be ranked world No. 1 in professional golf.If winning tournaments or setting records provides a buzz, it is not the be-all and end-all for Ko, a message that is reinforrced by her coach Sean Foley: ""Just because you win another event, yes, you'll be happy for that day, but it doesn't make you a better person or worse person the day after."" ""Sometimes for me, I identify myself with just the way I played that day,"" Ko told CNN Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue. ""And sometimes if I don't play well I go: 'Oh man, you're so stupid,' or things like that. Read More""And I think it's very easy to kind of connect your identity to that, but I've just got to separate that. And my goal is to hopefully have the career grand slam, I've been close in the three majors that I haven't won yet. And that would be probably my end goal.""In her golf career so far, Ko has won the Evian Championship and the ANA Inspiration. She has also come within just a few shots of winning the other three majors, finishing second at the Women's PGA Championship in 2016, as well as tying third at the US Women's Open and the Women's British Open. ""And I'm sure I'll be very, very happy, but I think sometimes results are so overrated and me being happy off the golf course, I think is the best thing that will make me happy on the course as well.""READ: Leona Maguire: the 26-year-old who shocked the golf world as unbeaten Solheim Cup rookieKo is presented with a photo board displaying her wins following her arrival at Auckland International Airport on September 18, 2013 in New Zealand.Fast starterStarting fast is something Ko knows all about. As well as her record-breaking victory at the New South Wales Women's Open in 2012 aged 14, she became the youngest winner of a Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour event in the same year.When she was 17, she set an LPGA record for most money earned by a rookie, raking in $2,089,033. In 2015, Ko became the youngest player in the ""modern era"" (post-1900) of either gender to win a major championship, winning the Evian Championship as an 18-year-old.Ko poses with the trophy after winning  LPGA Taiwan Championship on October 25, 2015.However, after winning the Mediheal Championship in 2018, her fortunes changed. For the first time in her young career, Ko endured a barren spell, entering 37 events between 2019 and 2020, failing to win one and finishing in the top 10 just eight times. Ko remembers when she was struggling for form and was searching for her ""consistency,"" adding that she was ""definitely overthinking and trying to overanalyze.""""I think before I used to not be that type of person and when you're struggling, you're trying to find answers and trying to dig deeper and deeper and deeper,"" the 24-year-old said. ""And sometimes it's good because you're able to go in and kind of see from the basic, but sometimes you can over complicate it. ""And in my case, I had done that and working with Sean (Foley), he was able to clear some of the questions in my head and he's been just as helpful, mentally and taking stuff that was unnecessarily in my mind, as well as the technique.""She admits that during her barren streak, she wasn't even really putting herself in contention, something Ko struggled with psychologically. Ko plays a shot on the fifth hole during the final round of the BMW Ladies Championship.Bouncing backBut this year Ko has enjoyed a renaissance.She ended her winless run at the Lotte Championship in Hawaii and won a bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She called the opportunity to represent New Zealand in Japan a ""huge honor.""And earlier in November, she romped to a dominant five-shot victory at the Saudi Ladies International. The victory at the event, which boasts one of the richest prizes on the Ladies European Tour (LET) schedule -- a $1 million prize fund -- moves her up to fifth in the world rankings and cements herself as one of the form players in world golf. Despite the early career success, Ko believes the 2021 season is her ""most consistent"" ever. Ko says her consistency this year can be partly explained by the lessons she learned when her form dipped. Ko poses with her bronze medal on the podium during the victory ceremony of the women's golf competition at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.""I think there was a time where I tried to chase to be the person that I was maybe when I was playing ... When I was No. 1,"" she said. ""But another player told me that you can't try and be your past, you have to be the best version of yourself in the present. And I think that really hit me. ""It kind of sounds like common sense, but when you're actually doing it and you're struggling, it doesn't seem like common sense. And when she told me that, I was like: 'Wow, that's so true.' And I think it just made me focus more on the now and not try and be somebody that I was before.""Already in her eighth year on tour, Ko is not one of the junior players anymore. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosAlthough she began the sport with the aim of retiring by the age of 30, she's the happiest she's been in her life ""on and off the golf course,"" something that's set her up for success in the future. ""I think just being happy off the golf course, that translates being on the golf course as well,"" Ko explained. ""And just how I approach playing and how I approach coming to the golf course every day, kind of the mood that I'm in. And I think at the end of the day, golf and being out here is work, but you still have to enjoy it. And the time that when you don't enjoy it anymore, it's not worth it.

With short summers and harsh winters, this island in the North Atlantic Ocean isn't the most obvious location for manicured fairways and greens. However, Iceland is experiencing a golfing boom unlike almost anywhere else in the world and the golfing culture here could help to reshape the sport as we know it.Situated half an hour's drive north of the capital city Reykjavik is Brautarholt Golf Course. Laid out across a dramatic cliff-lined peninsula, Brautarholt is the brainchild of founder Gunnar Palsson. ""This used to be agricultural land, but that had been declining,"" Palsson tells CNN Sport. ""This land has been in the family for hundreds of years and there were some generational shifts and we decided to build a golf course.""

Opening originally as a nine-hole course in 2011 before expanding to 12, Brautarholt was designed by renowned Icelandic architect Edwin Roald. Roald has attracted plenty of attention in recent years with his ""why 18-holes?"" movement, a philosophy that suggests golf course design would be improved if architects worked to create the best course for the space they have, rather than cling onto the ""antiquated"" notion that every course must be 18-holes long.JUST WATCHEDGolf in the land of fire and iceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGolf in the land of fire and ice 03:13""When you have limited resources, you are forced to use what nature has given you,"" Roald told Links magazine in 2017. ""If only you could break away from the constraints of having someone else tell you how many holes you must build. ""It is the same as writing books, or making movies. Imagine if all books had to be exactly 200 pages, or a film had to last 95 minutes. Would they be as good?""Despite comprising of only 12 holes, Brautarholt has been internationally recognized as one of the world's finest courses. In 2020, it was ranked No. 64 in a list of the World's Top-100 courses by Golfscape, alongside the likes of Pebble Beach and St. Andrews.A blueprint? With a short golf season in Iceland and long winters, golf clubs in the country are looking to find innovative ways of extending the season and making golf accessible to youth players all year round. The Iceland men's football team made headlines around the world for their exploits at the European Championships in 2016, reaching the quarterfinals and qualifying for their first World Cup in 2018. The women's team also qualified for three consecutive European championships from 2009 to 2017 having never previously qualified for a major tournament.Much of the national team's remarkable success has been attributed to the country's investment in state of the art, indoor facilities and excellent coaching, a blueprint that may end up being replicated in golf. JUST WATCHEDDuglegur: The World Cup & football in IcelandReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDuglegur: The World Cup & football in Iceland 17:11The GKG Club in Reykjavik is one of Iceland's largest golf clubs, comprised of an 18-hole course plus a nine-hole, par-3 course. With a thriving junior program and active membership, the club has recently invested in a state of the art $10 million indoor facility to allow members to practice throughout the year.Situated beneath the clubhouse, the indoor facility consists of a putting green, chipping area and 16 Track Man golf simulators, allowing users to play approximately 100 courses from around the world. Ulfar Jonsson is GKG's Sporting Director and has seen firsthand the impact the facility has made. ""We see our younger players are getting technically more advanced and better. So we're seeing better swings.""We encourage obviously all our players to play as much as they can out on the course over the summertime, but then they can come in here and work on the technique during the winter."" Having had limited success on the world's biggest tours, Haukur Orn Birgisson -- the president of the Icelandic Golf Union and the European Golf Association -- believes that the investment in facilities like the one at GKG could lead to results for Icelandic players at the highest level.""When you think about it, we have a golfing season that spans for about five, six months. So having indoor practice facilities means a lot and with new technology, these facilities have become so advanced. GKG is a perfect example of that. So now you have club members playing golf in wintertime, albeit indoors and in simulators, but it's important for their development. ""It's important for the junior development as well. You can look at football, for example. Fifteen years ago, they started having these indoor football facilities and a few years later, our national teams qualified for the European Championship and the World Cup. So there you go, it's important,"" he says. The facility at GKG has also provided a valuable social element to the club. ""Now, we have an all-year facility -- before, it was mainly a summer sport ... Now, all the golfers come in and they're playing with their friends in the simulators, enjoying a meal and a drink afterwards. So it's been fantastic for the morale of the club,"" Jonsson explains. A simulator is used at the indoor facility at GKG. SustainabilityAs well as being acknowledged as one of the finest courses to play, Brautarholt is also looking to become the most sustainable golf course on the planet. ""Here in Iceland, more or less all of our energy is renewable, so we thought it would be a good idea to move in that direction here,"" Palsson explains. Having embraced hydro and geothermal energy, nearly 100% of Iceland's electricity comes from renewable sources. Looking to take advantage of the country's clean energy, Palsson has invested in a fleet of 30 automated electric mowers.READ: The world is banking on giant carbon-sucking fans to clean our climate mess. It's a big risk.""We're at a point now where mowers running on electricity take care of approximately 98% of the golf course,"" Palsson says.Managing the fleet of small, orange mowers is the job of course manager and head green keeper Einar Jonasson. ""Yes, our little friends. They are just a different way of thinking of cutting the grass."" An electric mower used in Iceland's Brautarholt golf course. With a series of cables laid out around the course, the mowers are programmed to stay on the fairways and can be in action around the clock. As well as providing an environmental benefit, they have also allowed Jonasson to concentrate on other elements of course maintenance. In addition to a carbon footprint that is close to zero, Brautarholt is also maintained without the use of chemicals and with Iceland's year-round rainfall, there is little need for any irrigation. ""Our golf course is in a spectacular location and visitors come here to enjoy that nature. We don't want to harm the environment in the anyway possible, so we don't care if you see any weeds in the fairway, we don't want to harm anything,"" Jonasson explains.Having recently invested in a state of the art, electric, ride-on-mower for tees and greens, Brautarholt is looking to set a new, sustainable standard for golf course management.""I think we are the greenest golf course in the world,"" Palsson says with pride.  One of a kindDespite Iceland's population of less than 400,000, the country is home to a remarkable 65 golf courses -- and among them are some of the most spectacular courses you're likely to find anywhere in the world. ""I would encourage everyone to come to play here,"" says Birgisson.  ""The nature here is second to none ... When you play golf in Iceland, you get to experience that nature as well. You can play golf in lava fields, you can play golf in volcanic craters, on the banks of glacier rivers, with hot springs blowing up like Geysir right next to you with water hazards that are made out of boiling water. You can't get closer to nature while playing golf."" With the country situated almost equidistant to the US and Europe, is there any chance of one of golf's major tours taking a tournament to Iceland in the future?""One day, it could be possible. Imagine a PGA Tour event being played in the midnight sun that we have here in June and July, it would be fantastic,"" says Birgisson. Bright futureGiven the standard of the courses in Iceland, it's little wonder that golf has experienced huge growth in the country and now ranks as one of the most popular sports. ""Golf has risen enormously over the past 10-15 years, and we've actually almost tripled our numbers in the past two decades,"" says Birgisson, ""But the last two years have been explosive and now we have over 6% of the entire population that are actually members of a golf club.""But at the same time, we have probably about 40,000 that actually play golf. So 12% of the population plays golf and that I think that's -- that must be a world record.""Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos""It's also worth mentioning that the level of female participation has arisen from 10% to 33% in that time,"" he adds.With participation continuing to grow and innovative new courses and facilities, Iceland is quickly becoming one of the most exciting golfing destinations in the world. With momentum on his side, Birgisson is confident that things are just getting started.""We couldn't be happier, it's safe to say that the future of Icelandic golf is looking very bright."""

Struggling with your game? Try carrying an unborn child while you plot your way around the course.Twenty years ago, this is exactly what amateur Brenda Corrie-Kuehn -- eight months pregnant -- did at the US Women's Open at Pine Needles Lodge & Golf Club alongside playing partner Jennifer Greggain, who was well into her second trimester.Their scores were not the best and they were not the quickest around the course -- they were even put on the clock by officials given the number of toilet ""pit stop"" breaks Corrie-Kuehn had to quite naturally make.Yet the mother-of-three finished with a birdie and defied her obstetrician-gynecologist, who thought she was too close to the due date to be on a golf course in 80-degree heat.""I said to her: 'Over my dead body.' I qualified for this, I worked hard to get there, I am going to play,"" Corrie-Kuehn told CNN Sport.Read MoreA week later, daughter Rachel was born, and her 56-year-old mom will have inspired others to carry on living life when your tummy and your doctors are telling you no.Corrie-Kuehn tees off during the first round of the 56th U.S. Women's Open Championship at Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club in Southern Pines, North Carolina, on Thursday, May 31, 2001.""It was not pretty. I don't remember what I did, but there's a point towards the end of your pregnancy where you just get big very quickly,"" said the nine-time US Open veteran.""I think that happened between the time of qualifying for the Open and the actual event itself, and it's hard to fire the hips with the added weight, so my swing changed and I couldn't hit it very far. But I was glad to be there.""A lot of people asked me: 'How could you play that way?' What I was trying to show was it's part of life. I had some physical restrictions and after the US Open I played in a cart at home before Rachel was born.""What I was trying to show was just because you're pregnant, and unless you have a medical condition, you can do the same things you did before you were pregnant and after you deliver. That was my message.""With such golfing genes -- Corrie-Kuehn's mother was a Venezuelan national champion and so was her dad -- it's little wonder Rachel followed in her mom's footsteps to the renowned Wake Forest University in North Carolina where she also excels at golf, narrowly missing out on the Augusta National Women's Amateur finale at Augusta earlier this year.She has the most avid supporter in her mom, whose advice for any pregnant golfer is to watch how long you spend practicing on the greens.""It affected my distance a lot. Imagine having a 30-pound ball in front of you and trying to fire your hips, you would lose your balance. So my swing became very armsy and rhythmical.""But there's no reason for the short game not to be good -- although you cannot sit and practice your putting for a long time because your back kills you.""READ: Patty Tavatanakit: The golfer who admits it's 'odd' to think she's a major winnerStrong momsThree-time major champion Nancy Lopez has three daughters and won events while pregnant in the 1980s and 1990s.

I promised him if I felt anything uncomfortable, I would stop competing,"" said the 37-year-old, who hit 80 balls at full tilt that day and whose longest drive is 401 yards, five shy of the world record.Now expecting her second daughter, due in September, Carlborg has used the Covid-19 lockdowns to start a podcast called PowerMamas in Sweden to help empower new mothers.Carlborg is pictured playing on the World Long Drive Championship in 2016.""I'm getting weaker and weaker again so I'm really looking forward to coming back as a strong athlete for next year. My goal is to be my strongest me -- stronger than I've ever been and swing it faster than I ever have.""Many people say women are stronger after they've been a mom.""Carlborg gets some of her positive outlook from the way her sponsors initially took the news she was having her first baby.""It's a big difference nowadays. I was very nervous when I told my sponsors I was pregnant with Ebba, wondering what they were going to say, but I think that's been a big change in the past few years, in all sports.""I'm happy that we live not like 10-15 years ago, people always used to say: 'When you have kids. you're out of your sport.'  I hope more ladies are thinking that having kids won't stop them from being a high-level athlete.""Former Great Britain rower Baz Moffat founded the Well HQ earlier in 2021 with two doctors -- one of whom, Dr Emma Ross, has written a chapter on women and pregnancies in golf as part of a female athlete health book.""Pregnancy and post-natal recovery in sport is a really, really new thing. Brenda is a real one-off,"" Moffat told CNN.""It's only really since Serena Williams in 2014 that this has become more of a thing, in terms of more women sandwiching in children within their careers -- as opposed to just pushing their careers right up until the point they want to have children and that being the number one reason they retire from sport.""Mother-of-two Moffat, who trained with the Great Britain Olympic team between 2004-08, said the change has been massive from her day as an elite athlete post the Beijing Games.""I don't think there were any moms in the world of international sport back then.

On some days, though, there will only be a handful of guests visiting the facility dedicated to the ""greatest all-sport athlete of all time."" Even in her hometown, the name Babe Didrikson Zaharias isn't always widely known.Zaharias, who was born in 1911 and named Mildred Ella Didrikson, not only helped transform golf from a predominantly amateur sport into a professional one, but also held multiple Olympic world records.As well as being one of the 13 founding members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) in 1950, she went on to win 14 consecutive tournaments at the peak of her career.Van Natta Jr. believes it is ""quite disappointing"" that Zaharias' name isn't better known given all she did for golf.However, because of Zaharias' love of entertaining the gallery on the golf course with lewd jokes and colorful language, coupled with her refusal to conform to the traditional stereotypes of femininity of the time, she was a pariah amongst her fellow competitors and the subject of sexism and prejudice from the media.Read More""If somebody was looking at Babe and they were sexist or they didn't think that women belonged on a golf course or in a track and field event, she heard a lot of that,"" Don Van Natta Jr. -- author of ""Wonder Girl: The Magnificent Sporting Life of Babe Didrikson Zaharias"" -- told CNN Sport.""She was criticized for her look; she was criticized for not being ladylike enough. There were comments made in the press, that she should be home sitting by the phone, waiting for a suitor to call her as opposed to being out competing. It was very harsh, negative, critical things. And they hurt her deeply.""READ: Why record-breaking drives could change golf as we know itZaharias became a ""huge draw"" for golf crowds due to her energetic levels on the course, according to Van Natta Jr.'American sports heroine'The daughter of immigrants from Norway, sport always played a big part in Zaharias' life.From baseball and basketball to track and field and tennis, Zaharias seemingly excelled at whichever sport she turned her hand to. She earned her nickname ""Babe"" as a result of her baseball ability and comparisons between her and Babe Ruth.While she tried golf early on, a career in athletics was Zaharias' primary focus at a young age. Such was her dedication and cross-discipline ability at track and field, stories of Zaharias single-handedly beating entire teams became common across Texas.The pinnacle of her athletic career coincided with the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, a time when athletes, unlike today, didn't always specialize in one sport, but often entered multiple disciplines in the hopes of achieving success.Zaharias became a world record holders in the hurdles even before she started playing golf professionally.Women, however, were unable to enter more than three events, so Zaharias participated in the javelin, high jump and 80m hurdles.To this day, she is still the only track and field athlete, male or female, to win individual Olympic medals in running, throwing and jumping events. Zaharias won gold medals in both the hurdles and the javelin, and a silver medal for the high jump, but only after she was adjudged to have used an improper technique in a jump-off after tying with fellow American Jean Shiley.Van Natta Jr. believes that Zaharias could have won more medals had she been allowed to compete in a greater number of events.""I don't know about gold medals, but I think she could have medaled in probably at least five [sports],"" he said.""She came in first place, just among obviously her American counterparts, at the event at Northwestern [University] that was the qualifying event for the Olympics, and she won five of those events. So I believe she could have been medaled in five (javelin, hurdles, high jump, 100m sprint and discus) easily if she had been allowed to.""READ: The golfer who drove over 4,000 miles across the US to play in tournamentsZaharias throws the javelin to win the gold medal during the 1932 Olympic Games.BeginningsIn the 1930s, it was difficult for women to earn any sort of living in athletics due to an almost total lack of prize money and sponsorship opportunities.""Babe was very much thinking about a way to make a living as a sports woman,"" Van Natta Jr. said. ""And so she figured out that golf was one of the places that you could actually do it, even though a lot of the events were amateur events. But if you succeeded at them, she figured she could market herself and find some income that way.""Zaharias took up golf with a ""competitiveness that was beyond fierce,"" Susan Cayleff -- who authored two books about Zaharias' life -- explained.""She would drive golf balls until her palms bled and didn't set any kind of realistic limit on herself in terms of physical expectations,"" she said.However, her previous success in other sports led the United States Golf Association (USGA) to bar Zaharias from playing in amateur women's tournaments, compelling her instead to play in professional men's PGA Tour events.""They barred her in part because of a snob aspect,"" said Van Natta Jr. ""She was seen from the wrong side of the tracks, she was seen as a poor woman, she was coarse in the way she carried herself. She started defeating these wealthier women, well connected women to the USGA, so they knocked her out for a while.""READ: How Brendon Todd came in from the cold to grab himself a slice of the actionZaharias practises on Pinehurst's golf links for the exhibition match in New York.Standing outWhilst playing one of these PGA Tour events, Zaharias was paired with George Zaharias, a famous wrestler from the time. The two married in 1938, with George becoming her promoter and manager.With her husband's help, she became a ""huge draw for the crowds,"" Van Natta Jr. notes, with her ""chattering"" nature making her one of the sport's biggest draws.She was said to have shown up at professional tournaments and announced to the media: ""The Babe is here! Who is going to finish second?"" as well as standing on the first tee before teeing off and announcing that she was going to ""loosen my girdle and let it fly.""Babe Didrikson marries George Zaharias on December 23, 1938, in St. Louis.However, her lack of femininity -- ""telling bawdy jokes and swearing, sometimes spitting, drinking,"" according to Cayleff  -- and the perceived ""working class, gritty, sweaty"" nature of track and field competition put Zaharias at odds with her more traditional female competitors.And because she stood out from the rest of the field and wasn't the most gracious of victors -- ""She would rub the people who she defeated, their noses in their defeat,"" Van Natta Jr. explained -- Zaharias consistently found herself on the receiving end of negative coverage from a predominantly male media.Cayleff describes Zaharias as being a ""gender trickster"" as she behaved ""in ways that were absolutely contradictory to ideal femininity.""But as a result, she was vilified in the press, with even her sexuality coming into question at times.""They took her uniqueness and what I refer to as her gender outlaw status,"" Cayleff said. ""They take her behaviors and, particularly before she's married, absolutely craft her as a freak with newspaper headlines like: 'Mr., Miss or It?' or 'Which bathroom should Babe Didrikson use?'""They feared or presumed she was lesbian and then a particular term was coined in reference to her. She was called a 'muscle moll' or a member of a third sex. People were baffled and troubled by her gender presentation and particularly women golfers who tended to be of a more upper-class background and fancied themselves refined; they demonized her.""READ: Golf's new star is living proof you should never give up on your dreamsZaharias drives off to the 15th tee during her semifinals match against Jean M. Donald at Gullane Links, Scotland in 1947.ConformingTo counter the negative coverage, Zaharias recruited the help of Bertha Bowen, a Dallas socialite, who taught her how to ""apply makeup, how to wear a girdle and get her hair styled,"" Cayleff explains.""She was the subject of absolutely vicious press after the 1932 Olympics where people were openly speculating and disparaging her sexuality and the like. And she understood, with the guidance of Bertha, that if she wanted to earn a living and keep her name in the public that she needed to seriously craft an image because who she legitimately was, was not someone that the American public was easy to embrace.""Even so, Zaharias' competitive nature meant that she found it difficult to fully integrate into typical golfing society. This didn't stop her from becoming one of the most successful women golfers of the time, winning 41 professional tournaments in total.And as one of the LPGA's 13 original members, she ""planned and organized the golf tournaments, drafted the by-laws, supervised membership, (and) set up the courses"" to help establish the professional women's game, the LGPA website explains.Zaharias urges the ball into the hole on the 18th green of Chicago's Tam O'Shanter Country Club in the Women's All-American Golf Tournament in 1950.Although she did a lot for the sport for women, Cayleff contends that Zaharias was not a ""self-conscious role model or promoter of opportunity for women in sports.""Cayleff recalls an incident she found while doing research for her book when Zaharias threatened to withdraw from a tournament going into the final round, despite leading by several shots, because, in her eyes, the prize money was not enough.""Babe was out for Babe. In an instance like that, she was an absolute impact on increasing the purse in women's golf, but it was not for the betterment of the sport or the betterment of the female athletes in general. It was for Babe.""It's a sort of mixed legacy. Yes, she absolutely impacted opportunities for athletes that came after her and athletes during her own lifetime, but she was in no way what we would call a feminist or gender conscious or concerned about equity in general,"" Cayleff said. ""She was concerned about a good payday for her and let the chips fall where they may be on that.""Zaharias chips up to the green with a line of fans watching her.LegacyIn 1953, Zaharias was diagnosed with colon cancer and, at the time, doctors were not even sure they could cure her. However, in 1954, she not only returned to playing the sport, but won the US Women's Open in Massachusetts, her 10th and final major, by a dozen strokes, while having a colostomy bag strapped to her side.Zaharias chose to go public with her fight against cancer. This decision -- plus her remarkable comeback and her extensive work with the American Cancer Society -- helped change her perception in the eyes of both the public and the media, with Cayleff saying that it ""heroized her in some ways to a new generation.""Didrikson (right) works out with the New York Rangers players Murray Murdock (center) and Andy Aitkenhead, goalie, in Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1933.""She was honored by President Eisenhower for her work with the American Cancer Society and did considerable fundraising for cancer research,"" Cayleff said. ""The cancer work and the ability to come back and compete successfully was pretty much unheard of at that point. She was told she would never be able to compete again. And like she had done so many times in her life, she just tripled her efforts and determined she would prove them wrong.""Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosHer cancer eventually returned, and she underwent further surgery in 1956, ultimately dying from the disease in September of that year at 45 years old."

That's good news for the country as a whole, but the island nation's leopards are under threat. Sri Lankan conservationist Anjali Watson says that as forests where leopards live are cleared to plant crops and build homes, the big cats are being squeezed into pockets of wilderness that don't connect with each other. ""We've lost a lot of leopards,"" says Watson.

""We call it an umbrella species,"" she says, because taking steps to save leopards protects all the other species that share their forest home. A passion for wildlife Watson grew up in the city of Colombo, but ""I loved being out in wild spaces ... I have a strong affinity with animals"" she says.       (Video courtesy of Chitral Jayatilake) In 1994 she moved to Ontario, Canada, to study at McMaster University, and met her future husband, Andrew Kittle.A few years later the couple, who share a passion for wildlife, had settled in Sri Lanka. In 2000 they launched a pilot project to study leopards in Yala National Park in the island's southeast. At the time, very little was known about the elusive animals, says Watson. To protect them, it was vital to understand their lives -- and to count them. Watson and Kittle, who went on to establish the Wilderness & Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT) in 2004, currently work in four locations around Sri Lanka. They are investigating the size of the leopard population using remote cameras that take photos when they detect movement. Leopards that are caught on camera can be identified because each one has a unique pattern of spots -- and famously, their spots never change. Read: Google-backed project is collecting millions of wildlife camera-trap imagesInstalling the cameras is often grueling work, says Watson. It can involve long drives on spine-rattling, rocky tracks, clambering up hillsides, bushwhacking through jungle, and occasional encounters with elephants, bears and snakes, as well as leeches and ticks.Anjali Watson attaches a motion-detecting camera to a tree.Out in the field, the team collects leopard scat to find out which animals they are hunting -- leopards are not picky eaters and their diet includes deer, monkeys, wild boar, porcupines and hares. Watson hopes that WWCT's data will help to shape development plans that make space for leopards. If corridors between forest patches and buffer zones around protected areas are safeguarded, both humans and animals could thrive. Watson is dedicated to ensuring that these ""beautiful, fabulous creatures"" survive. "
asia,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/asia/fukushima-wildlife-intl-scli-scn/index.html,Wildlife flourishing in uninhabited areas around Fukushima ,By Amy Woodyatt," (CNN)Nearly a decade after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area. A Japanese serow explores the area. Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species -- including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.Read More""Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,"" James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said in a statement.Chernobyl control room now open to visitors -- but only wearing a hazmat suitPhotographic data was collected from 106 camera sites from three zones: Areas where humans were excluded due to the highest level of contamination; areas where humans were restricted due to an intermediate level of contamination; and areas where people were allowed to remain.Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited. In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people. Researchers captured images of more than 20 species, including macaque monkeys, in the areas surrounding the plant. Researchers also saw higher numbers of racoons, Japanese marten, a weasel-like animal, and Japanese macaque or monkeys in uninhabited or restricted zones. Species considered to be ""in conflict"" with humans, such as wild boar, were predominantly photographed in areas and zones evacuated by humans, Beasley said.Inside Slavutych, the city created by the Chernobyl explosionWhile the research monitors the radiological impact on wildlife populations as a whole, it does not give an assessment on the health of individual animals, scientists noted. The study was published Monday in the Journal of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, was produced in addition to the team's research on Chernobyl, where wildlife has also thrived in the wake of the disaster."

In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.On Thursday, AutoX, an Alibaba (BABA)-backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside. This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn't restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city's downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin. Read MoreIt also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.

""It's a dream,"" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. ""After working so hard for so many years, we've finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.""Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. ""We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,"" he said. ""The AI software is better [now.]""""From a technical point of view, the car is ready,"" Xiao said. ""It's very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.""AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called ""Professor X."" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won't change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.Race of the robotaxiWhile AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it's not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.In October, Alphabet's Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it's like to ride in a self-driving car.'I'm not drunk, it's my car:'  Tesla's 'full self-driving' gets mixed reviewsThis year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.In June, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.Recently, Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) also announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba's Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app. Michigan plans to redesign a stretch of road for self-driving carsThe startup's latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.Some of the company's lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.""The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,"" he added. ""For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.""China, home to the world's biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.""The bar is incredibly high,"" he said. ""It's extremely challenging, but we're very happy."""

Such offenses would be subject to up to three years imprisonment.It will also be an offense to perform conversion practices on anyone -- irrespective of age -- where the practices have caused serious harm, and offenders can be subject to up to five years imprisonment.Laws against conversion therapy have been gaining momentum around the world. Canada's parliament voted unanimously last year to ban LGBT conversion therapy.The United States does not have a federal ban on conversion therapy, but several US states, including California, Colorado, New York, Washington and Utah, prohibit the practice to some degree.Aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, conversion therapy can include talk therapy, hypnosis, electric shocks and fasting. In extreme cases, exorcism and ""corrective rape"" for lesbians, have been documented.Ending conversion therapy was one of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's campaign promises when she was elected for a second term last year."

Waseem Baloch's lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, confirmed the acquittal with CNN Tuesday but did not provide further details. A court order has not yet been made public. Waseem Baloch was arrested within days of the murder and confessed on video to killing his 25-year-old sister at her family home in the city of Multan in Pakistan's Punjab province. Despite his admission, he pleaded not guilty in court and in 2019 was sentenced to life imprisonment. Pakistan's so-called 'honor killings' typically involve the murder of a woman by a relative who believes she has brought shame upon the family. At the time of Qandeel Baloch's murder, Pakistan law allowed a murder victim's family to pardon a convicted killer. Read MoreRights activists feared this law would be used to spare Waseem Baloch. Three months after Qandeel Baloch's death, Pakistan lawmakers responded to the public outcry and passed legislation against the controversial practice -- a landmark ruling welcomed by rights activists and lawyers. The beheading of a diplomat's daughter shows how badly Pakistan is failing its womenBut Waseem Baloch's acquittal Monday has outraged women's rights activists in Pakistan. ""This man who confessed of killing Qandeel, his own sister, is a free man today in the same country where Qandeel couldn't live her life freely,"" wrote lawyer and activist Nighat Dad on Twitter Monday. ""This is the sorry state of not so sorry State...we are sorry Qandeel. Shocked and speechless,"" she said.  Sanam Maher, the author of ""A Woman Like Her: The Short Life of Qandeel Baloch,"" also expressed her anger on Instagram.""In a society that takes great pleasure in the punishment of women who break the rules, it should come as no surprise that each suspect in this case has been acquitted,"" Maher said.""After today's verdict, we may ask, who killed her? Nobody, it seems. In accepting that answer, we are all complicit in the crime of failing to protect women.""Waseem Baloch confessed to killing his sister on a video aired at a media conference.Qandeel Baloch gained both fame and notoriety in inherently conservative and patriarchal Pakistan for her bold, sassy and increasingly political social media posts. In posts not dissimilar to the millions of posts and videos shared by 20-something social media celebrities across the Internet, she pouted into the camera, discussed hairstyles and shared cooing confessions about her celebrity crushes.Qandeel referred to herself as a ""modern day feminist"" and had nearly 750,000 followers on Facebook.But in Pakistan, her antics pushed the boundaries of what is considered acceptable.In a confession video, Waseem Baloch said he was ""proud"" of killing his sister, adding that having his friends share her pictures and video clips was ""too much"" for him.""I drugged her first, then I killed her,"" he said. ""Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions. My sister never did that."" "

The so-called ""Freedom Convoy"" rallies in several parts of the globe follow a movement in Canada which has seen truckers protesting against vaccine mandates, Covid-19 restrictions and the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.In New Zealand's capital of Wellington, demonstrators have set up camp on the grounds of the country's parliament and have gathered on the streets to protest Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's vaccine mandate, according to CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand (RNZ).

asia,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/asia/kabul-attack-us-marine-testimony-update-intl/index.html,Testimony from US Marines casts doubt on Pentagon's account of Kabul airport attack aftermath,"By Nick Paton Walsh, Sandi Sidhu, Julia Hollingsworth, Masoud Popalzai, Sitara Zamani, Abdul Basir Bina, Katie Polglase and Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN"," (CNN)Newly released testimony from US military survivors of the August 26 attack at Kabul airport has cast doubt on the findings of the Pentagon's investigation into the incident, which concluded that nobody was hit by gunfire in its aftermath.  The testimony also adds to some of the questions raised in this week's CNN investigation, in which Afghan survivors recalled seeing people shot in front of them. Afghan medical staff in five hospitals also reported seeing gunshot wounds in the dead and wounded, and one doctor recalled removing bullets from four patients. The Pentagon had dismissed the Afghan accounts as the result of memories jumbled by the impact of the blast, or, in the case of the medical diagnoses, the result of inadequate examinations. The investigators have nonetheless accepted they did not speak to any Afghan civilians. The testimony comes in nearly 2,000 pages from the US military investigation that were released by US Central Command under a Freedom of Information Act Request from the Washington Post on Friday night. Most of the names of interviewees are redacted, making it hard to discern who each witness is. Yet from the details that remain it is clear numerous Marines reported shooting in excess of the three bursts of warning shots the US military investigation has stated were fired by US and UK troops, and did not harm anyone. Some of the accounts are detailed. One Marine, from the Female Search Team deployed to check Afghan evacuation applicants, is explicit about when and how she opened fire. She said she decided to enter the blast area to assist colleagues after the bomb detonated, and opened fire in thick smoke without knowing what she was targeting. ""I went in and saw a lot of Marines shooting by the jersey barrier. There was a lot of smoke,"" she told investigators in an interview dated 13 October. ""I couldn't see where they were firing. They grabbed me and I started firing my weapon as well. I don't know what I was firing at."" Read MoreRead more: Horror at Kabul's gate to freedomPentagon stands by investigation of Kabul airport attack despite questions raised in CNN reportThe testimony provides an important perspective on what the US military knew as it drew conclusions that no Afghans or US personnel were shot. Their conclusions have stated that Marines did not come under fire in the aftermath, and only shot controlled bursts of fire at two suspicious military-aged males, which hurt no one.  However, in the documents, several Marines recall gunfire impacting around them in the aftermath of the blast, one seeing a round hit a window in front of him. They raise questions as to whether all the rounds fired have been accounted for by investigators, or whether they were all harmless warning shots. One Marine from 1st Regiment recalled in an interview on October 1 what he saw when he ran into the tower next to the Abbey Gate entrance to the airport where an ISIS bomber detonated his device. ""I saw Marines return fire. I heard three distinct shots hit the back windows of the tower. The third round impacted right in front of my face as I was closing the ballistic glass window.""Another said: ""I could hear sporadic rounds snapping overhead for about 5 minutes. I didn't see any tracers but saw sparks when bullets would impact things."" A group interview by investigators with junior Marines who were at the blast site, from G company 2/1 Marines, had many accounts of bullets impacting around the troops. One Marine said: ""While I was applying tournequets (sic.) I saw ricochets. Never saw a shooter."" Another quote reads: ""I saw the shots hitting around us"". Another reads: ""I saw ricochets but didn't hear gunfire."" In other excerpts, Marines suggested colleagues fired many shots back. It is unclear how many Marines were interviewed, as names of speakers are redacted. ""If there were only 2-3 shooters and the amount of our guys shooting back, they would've been done,"" said one. Another said: ""I heard that a recon guy dumped about three magazines of ammo that way."" In some interviews, other troops say they did not fire at all in the aftermath, despite the chaos and possibility they were under further attack. Much of the testimony is consistent with the conclusions of investigators.A person wounded in the ISIS bombing attack outside Kabul airport on August 26, 2021. Clothes and blood stains of Afghans who were waiting to be evacuated are seen at the site of the ISIS bombing at Kabul airport on August 26.But the testimony also raises questions as to how thoroughly the US military assessed whether patients their medics treated after the blast were shot. US investigators have stated that medics treating the injured initially mistook injuries caused by ball bearings as gunshot wounds, as they looked so similar. One medic said: ""I think there may have been GSWs [gunshot wounds] sprinkled in, but that's inconclusive and wasn't medically worth trying to figure out. They would be treated the same."" The US military investigation has insisted there were no gunshot wounds detected among any patients US medics treated on the airport, and no bullets were recovered. One US medic, identified as a ""68Z,"" the military designation for a senior officer often with medical experience, said: ""Originally, a lot of the wound (sic.) were classified as gunshot wounds, but they were actually because of shrapnel. But there were some gunshot wounds. There was a non-US patient that had a bullet inside the back of his head after small arms fire."" The medic, whose name is redacted, said in the interview they saw 70 patients and: ""I was the person writing the patients on the board and assisting everywhere."" Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for US Central Command, said in an email earlier this week to CNN that the medic was contradicted by surgeons in the operating theater who said they did not remove bullets as they worked. He said the 68Z officer was ""was not a Medical Doctor or Officer, and was not administering medical care in the Operating Room"". The ""68Z"" does however, in the interview, say they were formerly a ""combat medic"" and an ""LPN,"" a licensed practical nurse.Urban said some of the testimony highlighted to him by CNN were ""examples of statements deemed less credible ... For each of these instances you describe, we had contradictory information from several credible sources.""  Urban added: ""While there are conflicting statements, as well as inconsistent evidence, the investigation team drew its conclusions based on a preponderance of all the evidence collected, after careful analysis and synthesis."" Biden to split $7 billion in frozen funds between 9/11 victims and Afghan humanitarian aid Urban also pointed to the likely impact of the blast on troops' recollections, and noted how investigators ""assessed credibility of Service Members based on their maturity and experience in operational environments."" The documents appear to record mostly the junior Marines at the scene of the blast seeing rounds impacting around them. Urban added that medics at the airport providing care did not assess how patients were injured. ""Medical providers did not make forensic findings at HKIA and were solely focused on treatment,"" he wrote in the email.""Many individuals and Leaders unaffected by the blast indicated that claims of incoming rounds were not accurate"", Urban said. Investigators during Friday's briefing at the Pentagon said the ""confined space"" in which the warning shots were fired ""caused an echo which created the illusion of a firefight"". Urban added: ""We have multiple sources unaffected by the blast that indicate those affected by the blast who claimed to fire their weapons did not."""

But Beijing's Big Air Shougang Olympic venue is drawing attention for its much edgier, urban setting.Behind the skiers launching themselves off the 60-meter-high (196-foot) ramp are furnaces, tall chimney stacks and cooling towers on the site of a former steel mill that for decades contributed to the Chinese capital's notoriously polluted skies. The mill, founded in 1919, ceased operations more than 15 years ago, as part of efforts to clear the air in the capital ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics.That left a large stretch of prime city center land, ripe for rehabilitation and regeneration, says engineering and design company ARUP, which transformed the site into a bustling hub for tourism and art exhibitions, in 2013 it even played host to an electronic music festival.A view of the big air slope for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics at Shougang Industrial Park.

One of the cooling towers even bears the logo for the Games. Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics: Top 15 athletes to watchThe jump has captured the attention of social media users, in part for the mountains of fake snow generated to host the event, but also due to intrigue over what these towers are and why they're still standing, right behind the jump.Some Twitter users wondered if it might be a nuclear plant.""The Big Air stadium at the Olympics seems to be right next to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,"" a user by the name of @jlove1982 wrote.Another, @LindsayMpls, wrote: ""Feels pretty dystopian to have some kind of nuclear facility as the backdrop for this Big Air skiing event.""The Shougang Big Air is the world's first permanent big air venue for long-term usage. It sits on the bank of the Qunming Lake, on the west side of the cooling towers at 88 meters (288 feet) above sea level, according to architecture firm TeamMinus, which designed the jump.TeamMinus outlined the inspiration behind its design on its website, citing the influence of Chinese flying apsaras, celestial beings which appear in both Buddhist and Hindu cultures.

New Zealand's Finn Bilous competes during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games at the Big Air Shougang.The Beijing government calls the site a ""Green and Eco Demonstration Area,"" according to ARUP, that could be scaled up in other parts of the country. While the regeneration project is a good example of how to repurpose aging infrastructure, the mill's closure was not necessarily a ""green"" decision, as operations -- and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with steelmaking -- were in actual fact moved to another part of the country.Panda-monium: From medal podiums to spectator stands, Winter Olympics mascot Bing Dwen Dwen is everywhereIn 2005, the entire production plant, which is owned and operated by state-owned steel company the Shougang Group, relocated to Caofeidian, in the adjoining Hebei Province, according to ARUP. The decision to move the plant was part of the Beijing government's economic restructuring and pollution control initiatives. China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases fueling the climate crisis, producing more than a quarter of the world's annual emissions.The Big Air is not the first element of the Beijing games to raise questions about the games' environmental credentials. The artificial snow being generated for the Games is made using large quantities of water and electricity.A recent CNN report also showed how the Yanqing venue was built in the former core area of the Songshan National Nature Reserve, a park founded in 1985 to protect its dense forests, alpine meadows and rich biodiversity.JUST WATCHEDWhy Beijing's pledge for green Olympics may be hypocritical ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy Beijing's pledge for green Olympics may be hypocritical  05:27The Beijing Organizing Committee did not respond to CNN's request for comment over whether it was aware the ski center was built inside the former core area of the nature reserve.

January was a record month of such tests, with at least seven launches, including a new type of ""hypersonic missile"" able to maneuver at high speed.Also among the tests was the first firing since 2017 of a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile, capable of striking US territories in the Pacific Ocean.Analysis: Kim Jong Un wants the world to know he still mattersA statement from North Korea's Foreign Ministry said a series of tests since New Year represented ""remarkable achievements"" that strengthened North Korea's ""war deterrence.""It also cited the Hwasong-15, the longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ever launched by North Korea, which hasn't been fired since its first test in 2017, and is believed to have the range to deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the US.Read More""In today's world where many countries waste time dealing with the United States with submission and blind obedience, there's only our country on this planet that can shake the world by firing a missile with the US mainland in its range,"" it said.""There are more than 200 countries in the world, but only a few have hydrogen bombs, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles,"" it said.Asked to comment, the US State Department repeated past statements that it harbored no hostile intent towards North Korea and urging a return to dialog, calls Pyongyang has persistently ignored.JUST WATCHEDAuthor on what Kim Jong Un's series of missile tests may mean ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAuthor on what Kim Jong Un's series of missile tests may mean  02:31A State Department spokesperson also called North Korea a threat to international peace and security and global nonproliferation efforts.""The United States has a vital interest in deterring (North Korea), defending against its provocations or uses of force, limiting the reach of its most dangerous weapons programs, and above all keeping the American people, our deployed forces, and our allies safe,"" the spokesperson said.Jenny Town, director of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea program, said the fact that North Korea's statement came from its Foreign Ministry probably made the statement less threatening than if might appear. ""The formulation is very passive. Not that they will do it, but that they can,"" she said.North Korea celebrated the anniversary of the founding of its army on Tuesday, a holiday that has occasionally featured major military parades with missiles and other weapons in previous years.North Korea tests a missile on January 27 in photo released by state media.There were no reports of a parade this year, however, and state media said the day was marked by senior military leaders visiting the mausoleum of the country's former rulers, among other events.US and South Korean officials have said they fear the launch of the Hwasong-12 on January 30 could be a step toward fully resuming tests of North Korea's ICBMs or nuclear weapons. North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test or fired an ICBM since 2017.The United States called on North Korea on Monday to defund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and prioritize the needs of its own people.A Washington think tank said on Monday it has identified a military base close to North Korea's border with China that is likely intended for stationing ICBMs.Talks to persuade Pyongyang to give up or limit its arsenal in return for sanctions relief have been stalled since 2019."

In one close-up view the plane hits the deck, bursts into flames and then spins in front of the camera full frame. The second angle captures the fiery wreck as it careens along the deck then slides off into the water.As the $100 million fighter makes its approach to the vessel, crew can be heard yelling ""Wave off, wave off,"" the term used for a plane to abort a landing attempt, accelerate and fly around to try again. But the warning to the pilot comes too late to avoid the crash.""That's really, really scary,"" said Peter Layton, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer now at the Griffith Asia Institute.Read MoreLayton noted that the F-35 seemed to have control problems on its approach to the carrier.Images emerge of one of the US Navy's newest stealth fighters crashing into the sea""As the aircraft is coming down the flaps are working overtime backwards and forwards. It looks like the pilot has lost control and is suffering oscillations,"" he said.He said the crash suggested to him the jet was not using an automatic landing system, digital controls which help limit the number of times the pilot must make corrections to get the plane safely on the deck. ""It's a really clever piece of software that links up the flight controls [the flaps] and the throttles and also gives the pilot some display so the pilot can monitor the system and fine tweak,"" Layton said. ""This is a reasonably new system that came out of the F-35 program.""The deployment on the Vinson was the first operational one for the F-35C, which only entered service in 2019. The US Air Force version of the stealth fighter, the F-35A and the Marine Corps version, the F-35B, were put into service earlier.The US Navy confirmed the authenticity of the video to CNN, but it has not yet released a cause of the crash.""We are aware that there has been an unauthorized release of video footage from flight deck cameras onboard USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) of the F-35C Lightning II crash that occurred Jan. 24, in the South China Sea. There is an ongoing investigation into both the crash and the unauthorized release of the shipboard video footage,"" Cmdr. Zach Harrell, spokesperson for Commander, Naval Air Forces, said in an email.The back-to-back images seen on the screen suggest it is a recording of the incident that was being replayed on the carrier when the recording was made.""The US Navy does videotape from several angles every landing so that they can go back and critique every pilot's landing,"" Layton said. An image from the first unauthorized video leaked from the USS Carl Vinson shows the F-35C shortly before it crashed on the deck.This video is the second unauthorized leak of the collision. Less than a week after the crash, video emerged of the plane on approach as did a still image of it floating momentarily on the surface of the sea.Seven people were injured in the accident including the pilot, who ejected from the plane, and six others aboard the carrier.The end of the video shows the crew responding to the incident within seconds, spraying down the deck of the carrier with foam to prevent further damage.Shortly after the crash, Navy officials described the damage to the Carl Vinson as superficial and said it quickly resumed normal operations.They also said efforts had begun to raise the wreckage of the stealth jet from the bottom of the sea.Analysts said raising the aircraft would likely be a complex operation, and one that would be monitored by China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea as its territory.The F-35C contains some of the Navy's most advanced technology, and the analysts said Washington would want to keep it out of Beijing's hands.However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was aware that a US Navy stealth fighter had crashed in the South China Sea, but ""had no interests in their plane.""""We advise [the US] to contribute more to regional peace and stability, rather than flexing force at every turn in [the South China Sea],"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.Though the Navy has not revealed where in the South China Sea the crash occurred, Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile (3.3 million square kilometer) waterway and has bolstered its claims by building up and militarizing reefs and islands there.Chinese naval and coast guard vessels maintain a constant presence in South China Sea waters."

The Justice Department alleged in its complaint that the state law ""uniquely discriminates against federal agencies and employees; impairs law enforcement efforts in Missouri; and contravenes the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.""""This act impedes criminal law enforcement operations in Missouri,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Wednesday. ""The United States will work to ensure that our state and local law enforcement partners are not penalized for doing their jobs to keep our communities safe.""Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The Justice Department for months has sought to overturn Missouri's law, called the Second Amendment Preservation Act. US law enforcement officials previously told CNN that federal agents have encountered a number of issues in the state since the law went into effect because local authorities are worried about running afoul of it. Read MoreIn some cases, police departments have withdrawn their officers from task forces led by federal law enforcement agencies.""The Missouri law has had a harmful impact on public safety efforts within the state. Prior to enactment of H.B. 85, state and local law enforcement officers in Missouri routinely worked shoulder-to-shoulder with federal officers to keep Missourians safe. They did so by (among other things) sharing evidence, data, and other information critical to law enforcement and by participating in joint federal-state law enforcement task forces,"" the Justice Department's complaint alleged. ""H.B. 85, however, now severely impairs federal criminal law enforcement operations within the State of Missouri.""Most of the conflicts raised by the law have come in operations involving the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which enforces gun laws, according to Justice Department officials. But other federal law enforcement agencies have encountered issues as well that hamper cases that need federal help.CNN previously reported that, in one instance, US marshals preparing for an operation with local police to arrest a fugitive allegedly involved in drug trafficking faced a series of last-minute hurdles because of the law.

It's the latest effort by the Biden administration to cancel student loan debt for borrowers who may already be eligible for debt relief but are still waiting for their paperwork to be processed. The agency has been chipping away at a backlog of forgiveness claims left over from the Trump administration that had been filed under a policy known as borrower defense to repayment. Under US Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, the department has canceled about $2 billion in borrower defense claims from more than 107,000 individuals to date. ""The Department remains committed to giving borrowers discharges when the evidence shows their college violated the law and standards,"" Cardona said in a statement. The borrower defense policy allows students who were defrauded by their colleges to seek federal debt relief. The forgiveness process was simplified during the Obama administration when big for-profit colleges like Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute shuttered. Read MoreBut the department stopped processing the borrower defense claims for months under former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who made it clear that she thought the rule was ""bad policy"" that puts taxpayers on the hook for the cost of the debt relief without the right safeguards in place.Former DeVry students get reliefWednesday's action marks the first time the Education Department is approving borrower defense claims associated with a currently operating institution: DeVry University. The department estimates that approximately 1,800 former DeVry students are eligible for nearly $72 million in discharges. More borrowers could see relief as the department continues reviewing pending applications. The Education Department found that DeVry University had misled prospective students from 2008 to 2015, falsely claiming that 90% of its graduates found jobs in their fields of study within six months of graduation -- and making the statistic a centerpiece of a national advertising campaign. In reality, the institution's job placement rate was around 58%, according to the Department of Education. Former students who demonstrate in their borrower defense claims that they had relied on the inflated statistic may be eligible for relief. The government will seek to recoup the cost of the student loan discharges from the institution. DeVry University spokeswoman Donna Shaults said in an emailed statement to CNN that ""the Department of Education mischaracterizes DeVry's calculation and disclosure of graduate outcomes in certain advertising, and we do not agree with the conclusions they have reached.""She also noted that DeVry has a different board and leadership than it did between 2008 and 2015 and ""has oriented our whole organization around helping people compete in a complex and changing labor market.""The Education Department also announced new borrower defense discharges for some former students who attended Westwood College, the nursing program at ITT Technical Institute, the criminal justice programs at Minnesota School of Business/Globe University, Corinthian Colleges and Marinello Schools of Beauty. None of these institutions are currently operating. 

More targeted debt reliefUnder Cardona, the Education Department has now approved about $16 billion in federal student loan discharges for more than 680,000 borrowers, including the $2 billion in borrower defense claims. It has canceled $7.8 billion for more than 400,000 borrowers who are unable to work because of permanent disabilities. It reached borrowers who were already eligible for the relief by automatically identifying them through a Social Security Administration data match.The department has also overhauled the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that cancels outstanding federal student loan debt for those who work in the public sector after they've made 10 years of payments. The Biden administration temporarily expanded the eligibility criteria so that it now applies to borrowers who have older loans that didn't originally qualify as well as those who were in the wrong repayment plan but met the other requirements. Those changes have resulted in almost $5 billion in debt relief for 70,000 borrowers. But the actions from the Education Department don't go far enough for some borrower advocates. There are still tens of thousands of pending borrower defense claims. ""This piecemeal approach barely scratches the surface of President Biden's borrower defense backlog,"" Eileen Connor, director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending, said in a statement Wednesday. The group represents borrowers in an ongoing lawsuit over unprocessed borrower defense claims. The Biden administration continues to be pressured by key Democratic lawmakers to offer more student debt relief. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have repeatedly called on Biden to use executive authority to broadly cancel $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower. The President has so far resisted those calls, despite expressing support for Congress to cancel $10,000 per borrower. Education Department officials say the agency has already canceled more student debt than any previous administration. It has also extended the pandemic-related pause on federal student loan payments that has been in place since March 2020. It's now set to expire May 1."

The new filing fleshed out the case against Michael Sussmann, a lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign who was charged with lying to a top FBI official during a meeting about then-candidate Donald Trump's connections to Russia. In the filing, Durham suggested Sussmann's allies ""exploited"" government databases to snoop on the Trump White House.  Right-wing media said it was exposing a scandal. What it really revealed is how bad information spreads in MAGA world This triggered a tsunami of coverage from pro-Trump outlets, and outrage from Republican lawmakers and Trump himself -- all of it rife with distortions, false claims and misinformation.   In a rebuttal filing Monday, Sussmann's lawyers said Durham was wrong about critical facts. His lawyers say the data was properly obtained and predated Trump's presidency. They also accused Durham of deliberately ginning up a false narrative for right-wing media.   Cyber researchers involved have said they are apolitical actors who were concerned about the national security implications of the data they uncovered. They also say Durham is cherry-picking their emails to make it look like they fabricated an unfounded narrative about Trump and Russia. Read MoreHere's a full breakdown of the latest twists and turns, in a saga that started over five years ago.   What new material did Durham reveal?  Durham previously accused Sussmann of working with cybersecurity researchers and data scientists to undermine Trump in 2016. They allegedly did this by digging up dirt about his ties to Russia, and peddling it to the media and US government agencies, in hopes of triggering an investigation. (Sussmann, who was charged with lying to a top FBI official, has pleaded not guilty and the case is slated to go to trial later this year.)   Durham alleged these researchers examined ""domain name system"" data, often called DNS lookups. It's like looking for a number in the phone book. A log is created when a computer gets ready to connect with a server, but the lookup itself doesn't prove that any communication occurred. Durham claims the cyber researchers had access to this trove of DNS data through a federal government contract.   Sussmann's allies believed they found some potentially alarming links from Trump to Russia, and have said it was within the purview of their government contract to look for security threats.   One dataset possibly linked the Trump Organization to Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Moscow. Separate DNS lookups suggested that obscure Russian-made smartphones may have been used at Trump Tower and the White House. Durham's recent filings gave the impression that this data was from during Trump's presidency, but that assertion is now hotly contested.   What did Sussmann do with the data?  Durham previously revealed that Sussmann met with a top FBI official in September 2016 and passed along the information about the potential Trump-Alfa connections. Sussmann also met with CIA officials in February 2017, and Durham's latest filing gave new insights into what was discussed.   During that meeting with CIA officials, Sussmann ""further claimed that these (DNS) lookups demonstrated that Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other location,"" Durham said in the filing.   But Sussmann's lawyers claim that isn't what he told the CIA -- and that Durham knows it. They also highlighted the fact that the meeting occurred after Trump took office, and therefore couldn't have been an attempt to undermine his campaign.  ""The Special Counsel is well aware that the data provided to (the CIA) pertained only to the period of time before Mr. Trump took office, when Barack Obama was President,"" they wrote in their court filing, accusing Durham of intentionally crafting a misleading narrative.   What have Trump and his allies said?  Trump and his allies essentially have taken Durham's assertions at face value -- and then some. They claimed, falsely, that the filings prove Trump was the victim of a massive deep state conspiracy to spy on his campaign and White House. Incredibly, Trump suggested that people involved deserve to be executed for their alleged actions. In lie-filled press releases, Trump falsely said Durham revealed ""indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on."" Former Pentagon official Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist, falsely claimed that Durham had proven that Clinton's campaign ""directly funded and ordered its lawyers at Perkins Coie to orchestrate ... a criminal enterprise to fabricate a connection between President Trump and Russia.""  Covering the Durham filings, Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo said the Clinton campaign paid to spy on Trump, ""before and during his time as president,"" even though Durham has never accused anyone of surveilling Trump's calls. She was one of many Fox hosts and guests to exaggerate or distort Durham's new filings.   In Sussmann's view, the right-wing feeding frenzy was no accident. His lawyers said in a rebuttal that ""the Special Counsel seems to be succeeding in his effort to instigate unfair and prejudicial media coverage,"" citing articles from conservative outlets like the New York Post and Breitbart.  Was the Trump-Russia data accurate?  With regards to the alleged contacts between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, both companies denied that there was a backchannel or that they colluded on the 2016 election.  The FBI investigated the underlying data and ruled out any improper cyber links, according to the Justice Department inspector general. A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report said in 2018 that it accepted the FBI's conclusions, but the report also pointed out that the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank gave contradictory explanations for the ""unusual activity.""    Regarding the Russian phones, Durham said his team ""identified no support"" for the claim that Trump associates used the devices near the White House. But Sussmann and the researchers called this a red herring. They said they found odd data at Trump Tower -- and separately at the Obama-era White House, while looking for security threats after a Russian hack in 2015.  What comes next in this saga?Legal experts have questioned the strength of Durham's case against Sussmann. For instance, there is only one witness to the lie he allegedly told the FBI, and that witness has given differing accounts of the situation. Before his trial, Sussmann will try to convince a judge to throw out the case because there isn't enough evidence. His first arguments on this front are due on Friday.  The five-year statute of limitations appears to have passed for Durham to charge Sussmann with crimes related to his CIA meeting. Sussmann maintains that he had no reason to doubt the information that he passed along to the CIA. Beyond that, the Durham inquiry is ongoing, but it's unclear if he if has the goods to indict anyone else or allege a broader anti-Trump conspiracy.     Ironically, many of the key players have seen a role reversal in this saga.   There was rampant speculation in left-wing circles that special counsel Robert Mueller would bring down Trump's presidency, and send him and his family to prison. Now, Trump and his allies are breathlessly hyping up the Durham probe, and have welcomed each development as proof that bombshell indictments against top Democratic figures are right around the corner.

But last week's Supreme Court decision to allow Alabama's new congressional map -- which voting rights advocates say dilutes the power of Black voters -- to remain in place has left Goodson, who volunteers to register voters, discouraged about casting a ballot herself. ""I was really very hurt, you know, and angry really by the decision by our Supreme Court,"" said Goodson, an adjunct professor at the University of Montevallo. ""There are people that are making decisions, not because it's the law, but they're making decisions to uphold White supremacy by diluting my vote."" ""It is discouraging because I don't know what I could do as a citizen to change anything,"" she added.  Kenya Goodson registers voter and assists with the Census count at the Government Plaza in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Legal challenges are expected to continue in this case, and similar lawsuits have been filed in Texas and Georgia, which will bring the issue of voting rights, racial gerrymandering and discriminatory election practices to the forefront ahead of the midterm elections. Read MoreThe Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments over the Alabama map, which could determine the fate of the landmark Voting Rights Act.Goodson said she is still going to vote, and will encourage others to do so, because ""our ancestors ... helped us to get this right,"" but community organizers worry there could be ""devastating implications"" that marginalize Black voters and could, in turn, impact turnout and faith in the democratic process.  LaTosha Brown, an Alabama native and founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said this ruling is ""really rubber-stamping voter disenfranchisement."" ""But it's not just about Alabama,"" Brown added. ""It has implications for voter protections around the country."" What is redistricting?Felicia Scalzetti, a redistricting organizer for the Alabama Election Protection Network and the Ordinary People Society, told CNN, ""The problem with redistricting is that ... it changes who you can vote for.""  ""You can encourage people to turn out all you want,"" Scalzetti said. ""But if the slate of people on the ballot do not actually represent your community because your community is cut six ways to Sunday, there's no amount of turning out that's going to fix that.""  Redistricting is the process of reallocating congressional seats every 10 years based on population changes reflected in the US Census and then redrawing the boundaries of the congressional districts so each has an equal population.  In 35 states, the legislature has control over the redistricting process, which raises concerns about the incumbent party manipulating the process in its favor, also known as partisan gerrymandering. In this election cycle, 20 of the 35 states are controlled by Republicans, compared with 11 favoring Democrats, according to the Pew Research Center. Four states have divided governments.  'They know where Black voters live': Challengers say 'race blind' redistricting maps are anything butSimilarly, redrawing in terms of race is known as racial gerrymandering. Since voters of color tend to favor Democrats, redistricting driven by party interests or fueled by racial motivation -- whether to curb voters of color or amplify their influence -- go hand in hand.  Alabama's Republican-drawn map gives Black voters the majority in only one of seven districts despite them making up 27% of the population. Thus, the Alabama lawsuit argued that it had been drawn based on race, and used the ""cracking"" and ""packing"" tactics to specifically dilute the power of Black voters.  The map lumped areas with high concentrations of Black people together in one district where they could be the majority -- known as packing -- and split up other Black voters in the state so they remain a minority in all other districts -- known as cracking. It will remain in place for the state's primaries in May. 

""The thinking that we could just disenfranchise people at the state level is still here and it still operates a large part of the state's attitude toward our voting structure,"" Dev Wakeley, policy analyst at Alabama Arise, a nonprofit public policy advocacy organization, told CNN.Wakeley and others say the map is a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits any practice that denies or curtails the right to vote based on race. The law included a provision that mandated states with a history of discriminatory practices, which included Alabama, to obtain federal approval before changing electoral practices, but it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.  In fact, a lower court unanimously ruled that the new congressional map violates the Voting Rights Act, and the three-judge panel -- which included two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump -- ordered the state to draw another district where Blacks made up a majority of voters or close to it.  What the Supreme Court's decision on Alabama's maps could mean for the Voting Rights Act""No one had any faith that the state of Alabama was going to have voters' best interests at heart,"" Wakeley said. ""We expected a little more of an attempt at a fig leaf by the Supreme Court.""  But with a conservative majority and in a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the new map to stay in place while the case plays out, and experts say the highest court's decision ""sends a very strong signal.""  David Canon, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who focuses on redistricting, told CNN, ""It'll be harder for states to follow what we thought was settled law when it comes to creating minority-majority districts or even influence districts.""  ""It's going to be more of an uphill climb now for anyone to win a voting rights challenge,"" he added. Similar battles nationwide ""The sort of anti-democratic ideas that have infested a lot of Alabama decision makers are much more widespread,"" Wakeley said.  ""While we might be the sort of sandbox where these terrible policies come into play,"" he added, ""we're far from alone.""  Other states have also been accused of intentionally suppressing the vote of communities of color in their redistricting plans.  A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting powerMark Gaber, who litigates redistricting cases for the Campaign Legal Center, told CNN, ""It just seems, you know, that wherever the folks in power want to retain their power, they'll, you know, have no sort of shame about violating voting rights of minorities."" The Campaign Legal Center is a non-profit legal advocacy organization that has filed lawsuits against multiple states for racial and partisan gerrymandering.  Texas faces multiple lawsuits, including one filed by the Biden administration in December, for its congressional map, which the Justice Department says does not reflect the state's growth in minority population.  The state was awarded two additional congressional seats due to minority communities, who made up 95% of the state's overall population growth, but the Justice Department said Texas had drawn the map in a way that the two new seats would be decided by  majority-White voting populations.  The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit against Georgia last month on behalf of multiple advocacy groups, saying the state's new congressional map is ""its latest assault on the rights of Black voters and other voters of color to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and elect candidates of their choice.""The lawsuit alleges that Georgia, similarly to Alabama, packed voters of color into one district and spread out remaining voters of color to ensure they are the voting minority in two other districts.  ""We're in a very sort of unstable time in this landscape of voting rights law, and also just generally about elections in the country,"" Gaber said. ""And I think the last decade of experience in America proves that now more than ever we need protections for Black and Latino voters.""  "

About two-thirds of the reports this year allege violations of the federal mask mandate. The FAA said Wednesday it has referred a total of 80 incidents to the Justice Department to consider criminal prosecution.The spike in incidents has airlines calling for a government-coordinated ""no-fly list"" for passengers who create in-flight disturbances. Proponents say it would be separate from the existing government-run list that is part of the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database.   Airlines may ban an unruly passenger from their own flights, but competition rules mean that information is not shared with other carriers. CNN broke news of the industry's ask to the government in September, and Delta Air Lines renewed the request this month in a letter to the Justice Department.  Read MoreThe Senate group says they ""strongly condemn"" the violence, but urge the Justice Department to reject the request.

""We urge the FAA, TSA, and DOJ to come together to implement a plan with due process to keep dangerous flyers on the ground.""CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg suggested to CNN's Dana Bash last fall that a federal no-fly list for violent airplane passengers ""should be on the table,"" and he told CNN last week that federal authorities were still ""looking at"" such policy recommendations.But, he acknowledged, ""there are enormous implications in terms of civil liberties, in terms of how you administer something like that.

Two passengers were charged this week with interfering with flight crew members after attempting to open aircraft exits in flight. In one of those incidents, four passengers helped American Airlines crewmembers subdue a passenger armed with plastic utensils and a wine bottle who was pulling on a door handle.  Buttigieg declined in a recent CNN interview to say whether the mask mandate will be allowed to expire in mid-March or whether it might be extended or lifted earlier.  ""When we have the guidance saying that is the right thing to do, I will be as relieved as any traveling American that we can move on to the next phase,"" he said.  The FAA's announcement that it has referred 80 incidents since the start of last year to the Justice Department marks about a doubling of referrals since President Joe Biden called for an increased role for the Justice Department in October. In November, the FAA said it had referred 37 cases for prosecution. Not all cases can be referred for prosecution and many of the cases referred to the FBI for criminal review involve physical assault on crew or passengers, and sexual assault or harassment cases on a passenger or crew, a FAA spokesperson said.The FAA called the issue a priority and said the agency, along with the FBI, are ""continuing to work together so unruly passengers face criminal prosecution when warranted.""

us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/politics/mazars-trump-letter-letitia-james/index.html,What to know about accounting firm Mazars' move to back away from Trump,"By Tierney Sneed, CNN"," (CNN)Mazars USA, the accounting firm that former President Donald Trump and his businesses have used for years, cut ties with him in stunning fashion, declaring it could no longer vouch for the financial statements it has complied over the past decade. The February 9 letter was disclosed Monday amid litigation around a civil investigation into Trump and his businesses, where New York Attorney General Letitia James has alleged that Trump's business had made misstatements and omissions in the financial statements that were used in its dealings with banks. The Trump Organization denies those claims and is currently seeking to freeze the investigation. The accounting firm is backing away from Trump now after standing by his side for years of controversies and allegations about his financial practices. ""For an accountant to basically withdraw their report and to alert the client that the financial statements aren't reliable is a pretty extreme action,"" said Terri Herron, a professor of accounting at University of Montana. ""It's required by our standards that we do that as CPAs. But it doesn't happen very often."" Here is what to make of the move: Read MoreWhat did Mazars just do?   Mazars -- via the letter to the general counsel of Trump's businesses, Alan Garten -- notified the Trump Organization that the financial documents that firm has compiled on behalf of the former President should no longer be relied upon. The letter was made public on Monday in a court submission by James, who is investigating Trump and his businesses to determine whether any insurers, lenders or others were misled by their financial statements.  The Mazars letter also firmed up previous indications that the firm was winding down its relationship with Trump and his businesses, telling Garten that the firm was ""not able to provide any new work product to the Trump Organization.""  The Point: Donald Trump's financial and legal problems just got a lot worse""Due in part to our decision regarding the financial statements, as well as the totality of the circumstances,"" Mazars said, it had ""reached the point such that there is a non-waivable conflict of interest with the Trump Organization."" The firm said it would not even finish preparations of tax returns due Tuesday for Trump and his wife Melania Trump. The letter flagged that Mazars had been seeking ""for several months"" information about an apartment tied to Matt Calamari Jr., the Trump Organization head of security who has been cooperating in the criminal investigation into Trump's businesses.  ""Once that information is provided to your new tax preparers, the returns can be completed,"" the letter said.  Why does it matter? The letter has implications both for the investigations into Trump's financial dealings and for the future business endeavors of the former President.  James disclosed the letter as part of her bid for a court order compelling Trump's compliance with her subpoenas in her civil investigation. Trump has sought to quash the subpoenas -- which included demands for testimony from two of his children -- with a claim that James was unconstitutionality seeking to ""circumvent the entire grand jury process"" by issuing the subpoenas in the civil proceedings while a separate criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney plays out.  James said in court filings Monday that Mazars' new assertions doubting the reliability of the Trump financial documents vindicated her effort to investigate the statements. Last summer the Manhattan District Attorney's office filed criminal charges alleging the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg were engaged in a 15-year tax fraud. Prosecutors have been investigating the Trump Organization for years and last fall sharpened its focus into the accuracy of the financial statements. They interviewed several former Deutsche Bank employees involved with Trump about the loans, CNN reported.  Weisselberg has pleaded not guilty and a trial is slated for this summer.Who has been implicated?Donald Bender, the lead Mazars partner who has been Trump's accountant for years, is cooperating with the district attorney's investigation and has appeared before the New York grand jury. ""Anytime you're in an adversarial position with your client, it really is a conflict of interest,"" said Herron. ""If he is testifying against the Trump Organization or working with the prosecution that would surely be a conflict of interest that you would want to cut ties."" Calamari Jr. -- the Trump Organization security chief referenced in the new Mazars letter -- has been granted immunity for the testimony he's already given in the criminal investigation. His lawyer Nick Gravante told CNN on Tuesday that it was ""unmistakably clear that his apartment has always been treated properly for tax purposes.""  Calamari Jr.'s father, Matthew Calamari Sr., is Trump Organization's chief operating officer and last year, he was told that the Manhattan district attorney was not at the time intending to bring charges against him.  Problems for businessesRegardless how the civil and criminal investigations wrap up, Mazars' new assertions could cause headaches for Trump's business prospects. The firm has put Trump on notice that other parties that have been relying on the financial materials assembled by Mazars should be made aware that those financial statements are not reliable.  ""This is about as calamitous a thing that could happen to a business that you can imagine -- other than getting indicted or going bankrupt,"" George Conway, conservative lawyer and outspoken Trump critic, told CNN's ""AC360"" on Monday evening. ""And this could lead to going bankrupt."" Why is Mazars doing this now? The letter pointed to court filings submitted last month by James -- as well as Mazars' own investigation and ""information received from internal and external sources"" --  to explain why the firm was no longer confident in the reliability of the materials it produced for Trump.  In a statement Tuesday, the firm did not go into any more detail into why it was backing away from Trump now.  ""Due to our industry's professional obligations Mazars cannot discuss any clients -- current or former, the status of our relationships, or the nature of our services in a public forum without client consent or as required by law,"" the firm said. ""We remain committed to fulfilling all of our professional and legal obligations.""  James last month made a litany of allegations against Trump.  James said her office had identified numerous ""misleading statements and omissions"" in tax submissions and financial statements used to obtain loans. She laid out several specific alleged misstatements, including about the size of Trump's Trump Tower penthouse; the supposed ""outside professionals"" used to reach valuations of Trump assets; and alleged misstatements about the process by which Trump or his associates reached valuations. A spokesperson for Trump Organization said at the time of the filing that James' allegations were ""baseless and will be vigorously defended.""  Why is Mazars doubting the reliability of its work?  Mazars sent mixed messages about the accuracy of its Trump financial documents. The firm told the Trump Organization that ""based upon the totality of the circumstances, we believe our advice to you to no longer rely upon those financial statements is appropriate."" But Mazars noted that it had not concluded that ""as a whole"" the documents ""contain material discrepancies.""  Mazars also stressed that the work the firm did was performed ""in accordance with professional standards.""  The firm additionally disclosed that it believed that Trump may have overpaid his taxes in prior tax payments. A spokesperson for Trump Organization said in a statement Monday that the company was ""disappointed that Mazars has chosen to part ways,"" while touting the firm's indication that it had not concluded there were material discrepancies in the statements. ""This confirmation effectively renders the investigations by the DA and AG moot,"" the Trump Organization said.  The court that is presiding over Trump's request to quash James' subpoenas will hold a hearing on Thursday. CNN's Kara Scannell, Jessica Schneider and Paula Reid contributed to this report."
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/economy/inflation-fight-pain/index.html,The Fed's battle to fight inflation could cause more pain than higher prices,"Analysis by Chris Isidore, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)Rapidly rising prices have caused economic hardship for millions of Americans. But drastic action to rein in prices could lead to even more pain, including job losses.Overall prices jumped 7.5% during the last year, according to the January consumer price index reading, the fastest pace in nearly 40 years. The increases have squeezed household budgets for consumers, caused political problems for Joe Biden and resulted in calls for the Federal Reserve to take relatively severe action, such as its first half-percentage-point hike since 2000.But some economists are cautioning that would be a very bad idea, hurting the people that the battle on rising prices is meant to help. That's because the main tool available to the Fed to fight inflation — raising interest rates — is designed to curb inflation by slowing what has been a very strong economy.Even with the best year of economic growth and job gains in decades, the economy still has 2.5 million fewer jobs than it did heading into the pandemic. So employers need to continue hiring. But a slower economy means fewer job gains, perhaps even job losses for the lowest income segment of the workforce.Read More""The people you're drafting into the fight against inflation when you raise interest rates and slow the economy are the most vulnerable,"" said Robert Reich, the former US Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton and a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. ""The purpose of raising interest rates is to take the air out of the sails of the economy. If it works, you are by definition are going to have fewer jobs. Even small increases in interest rates, if they have the desired effect, will cause job losses and wage losses.""Still it's clear that high prices are a major concern for many Americans. It is widely accepted that the Fed must take action against inflation.Rate hike history a reason for concernThe last time the Fed hiked rates by a half point in a single move was May 2000. The labor market was exceptionally strong then. Unemployment had hit what was then a 30-year low of 3.8% in April of that year. Although the consumer price index in March of that year was 3.8% -- about half of what it is today -- it had more than doubled over the previous 12 months, raising concerns about inflation. The Fed, which had raised rates by one quarter point five times since the previous June, decided to get even tougher with a half-point hike in May 2000.The economy did not take it well.Private sector employers, who had added jobs every month in the previous five years, suddenly cut jobs in May 2000.They returned to adding jobs for most of the rest of the year but then started trimming jobs most months starting in early 2001 — losses that continued for three years. Many experts blamed the job losses on the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which occurred in the summer of 2000.  But many job cuts came in non-tech sectors such as construction, retail, automaking and airlines.The economy fell into recession in early 2001, and the Fed was soon cutting rates a half-point at a time to try to pull the economy out of recession. Even if the recession was ""mild"" by economic standards, the jobless recovery that followed was no one's idea of a strong economy. That's what has many critics of war on inflation so worried.""Every time the Fed has tried to slow the economy by bringing prices under control, it has overshot,"" said Reich.Fed powerless to fight much of inflationOne big concern for Reich and other critics of tighter monetary policy is the belief that most of today's inflation pressures are coming from things that the rate hikes will do little to control. Much of the rise in oil prices came due to geopolitical issues, such the decision by OPEC+ nations to cut production when demand for oil plunged in the beginning of the pandemic. But demand came back more quickly than expected, and supply has not kept up with that demand. Prices on the world's commodity markets are up more recently because of concerns that Russia, one of the world's leading oil producers, will invade Ukraine and be subject to economic sanctions, further driving up oil prices. A 40% rise in gasoline prices by itself has raised the overall consumer price index by 1.5 percentage points in the last year. Record car prices are another major factor, and those have been driven higher by a shortage of computer chips and other parts, which forced automakers around the globe to temporarily halt production. The reduced production has affected both new and used car prices, and together those car prices raised overall CPI by about 2.2 percentage points.So 3.7 percentage points, or just less than half, of the 7.5% increase in CPI is due to the increased price of those three items alone -- gasoline, new vehicles and used cars.""Most of the inflation we've seen over the last 15 months has been about extreme distortions the pandemic has put on the economy,"" said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank.Rate hikes could hit your home valueOne segment of the economy on which the Fed can have an impact by raising rates is the housing market. This is another segment of the economy that has seen drastic price increases, with the average home value increasing a record 16.9% in 2021. That has had an impact on rents as well, and priced some buyers out of the housing market.Higher mortgage rates will serve to cool housing price increases, even as it continues to lift the cost of buying a home. The fed funds rate, which the Fed sets, doesn't directly correspond to most mortgage rates, but it influences the bond market, which does. And so the anticipation of future rate hikes by the Fed has already started to lift mortgage rates, with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage rising by nearly a full percentage point in the last year to 3.69% according to Freddie Mac. If those rates continue to climb, housing price increases are likely to slow, or even reverse. That would be good news for home buyers, and perhaps for renters, but bad news for homeowners. And that could slow consumer spending.""Any time housing prices fall, because [homes are] such a big part of wealth, there's going to be some cutback on consumption,"" said Bivens.And there are other risks from lower housing prices, including less home building to alleviate a housing shortage in many markets. At the most extreme it was a bursting of a housing bubble that caused the Great Recession. Most economists don't expect that to happen again, but many dismissed the chance of a housing bubble bursting the last time it happened.How quickly can rates be raised safely?When the pandemic hit, the Fed cut its fed funds rate by 1.5 percentage points to essentially zero. It has stayed there ever since. Many economists came into the year expecting the Fed to raise rates three or four times by a quarter point each time. The rising inflation pressures now has some calling for a half-point increase right off the bat, and nearly 2 percentage points of increase overall throughout the year. Bivens doesn't necessarily oppose the Fed starting to raise rates, but he would advocate doing it slowly with small quarter-point increases, and perhaps not at every meeting, as policymakers wait to see if the pandemic-inflated prices return to normal.""Yanking down on aggregate demand level by raising rates would be a machine gun approach to something that needs a scalpel,"" he said.Even some economists who would raise rates faster than Bivens agree there will be economic pain caused by doing so.Here's one reason people hate this economy, despite low unemployment: A return of the misery index""The mechanism by which monetary policy addresses inflation is it slows down the economy. It's a very, very painful path,"" said Justin Wolfers, professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. Still, he believes that the current rates are low enough, especially in comparison to the inflation rate, to make rate increases less risky than some past hikes. But Wolfers says there is a risk that the economy will start to lose jobs, rather than just slow the pace of job increases, once the Fed starts to raise rates.""What (Fed Chairman Jerome) Powell is hoping for is a so-called soft landing, creating a small number of jobs each month, and allowing the economy to go sideways and it catches its breath,"" he said. ""There's a long history in the US and elsewhere of failing to achieve that soft lending."" -- CNN's Matt Egan contributed to this report"
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/homes/us-home-flipping/index.html,What it takes to make money flipping homes in a crazy real estate market,"By Anna Bahney, CNN Business","More people are flipping homes, but they are making less of a profit.Investors looking to get a piece of skyrocketing home prices by buying a home, fixing it up and then quickly putting it back on the market, aren't getting quite the returns they used to. Finding a home to buy in the first place is more difficult, with record low inventory of homes and foreclosures. And rising competition for whatever homes are available means even shoddy homes in terrible condition are selling for a fortune. Plus, materials and labor shortages have made fixing up a place more costly.There were 94,766 single-family houses and condominiums in the United States that were flipped in the third quarter of last year, the most homes flipped in a quarter since 2006, according to real estate data provider Attom. But profits remained below where they were a year ago.Read MoreThe gross profit on a typical home flip transaction was $68,847 in the third quarter, down from $70,000 a year before, according to Attom. That's a return on investment of 32.3%, down from 43.8% a year earlier, its lowest point since 2011. The decline in profit margins is largely because many investors bought when home prices had shot up, then sold when prices were rising more slowly, according to the report. Still, a 32% profit before expenses is not turning off investors. Here's how they're making it work.Know the marketDanielle Green has been flipping homes in Baltimore since 2018. She buys homes from the city at auction and has seen a big difference in the availability of properties and their cost. ""I used to be able to buy a home for $5,000 or $10,000 at auction prior to the pandemic,"" said Green. ""Now they are going for $20,000 or $40,000.""Fewer properties were available as the auction process slowed down during the pandemic, Green said. Also, auctions that were once held in person moved online, which enabled more buyers to bid. And, Green said, there is a knock-on effect as investors in nearby cities look for cheaper homes to flip. Danielle Green, in front of a house in Baltimore that she flipped last year, said that homes that make attractive flips are harder to find and higher priced than before the pandemic.
""Some investors have been priced out of their areas, so they come to Baltimore from Washington, DC, or Philadelphia and they drive up our prices,"" Green said.With so few single-family row homes available, Green has begun buying small multi-family homes with three or four units. While she sells some of her properties, she keeps others to rent out in order to keep some money coming in. ""Before the pandemic, I was doing three or four deals a year,"" she said. ""Now I'm down to one or two big deals a year. It is doable. You have to know your profit margin and work to keep it.""She has not been immune to labor shortages and supply cost increases, but Green said she feels she has an advantage over investors from other areas because she's lived in Baltimore and knows which neighborhoods will carry what prices.""Investors come in and think it is easy to buy because the houses seem cheap -- they'll think buying a shell [of a house] for $40,000 is a deal,"" she said. ""But I know that's not the best neighborhood. You have to know the market and understand what you're buying.""Stick to a firm budgetLeah Wensink, who's been flipping since 2014 and is now working in Harrogate, Tennessee, said she paid the most she ever had for a flip this year.Wensink bought a home for $170,000 last June and said the only way she will be able to make a profit is that she paid cash for it. Not having to make monthly payments gives her the breathing room to do some of the work herself or find more affordable alternatives to get around price hikes in labor and supplies. She expected it would take her nine months to finish, but Covid-related delays have pushed it closer to a year.Leah Wensink, who's been flipping houses since 2014, said she paid the most she ever had for a flip this year.Wensink said her approach to profitability is pretty simple. She draws a hard line on how much money she is willing to spend.""If I stay under that amount, I know I can make money,"" she said. ""I don't spend a lot of time planning down to the Nth degree my margins. That's just not what I want to do with my life. But I do a lot of research to see what's happening in the market. And I like to give myself a huge cushion so that if I don't end up selling it for this higher amount, then I can always lower it."" But Wensink is worried about making her money back on this current house, her biggest flip to date. ""This house was not livable when I bought it,"" she said. ""It had water damage. And so I've had to come in and just take care of those things right off the bat and tear everything out. I am worried about it because I don't think people are going to see half the work that's been done in this house, which is the bummer of buying a house that needs this much work.""Find solid partnersOn one of his first flips in 2017, Lukas Vanagaitas lost his life savings. So he brought in a lending partner, Kiavi, to help finance his flips. That helped him grow his real estate business, Horus Homes, from four or five transactions a year to 100.""In my first year investing, everything that could have gone wrong went wrong and I ended up losing $100,000,"" Vanagaitas said. ""I made a lot of mistakes and had to start back at square one. It took some time before I got back on my feet and I had to live in my flips while I remodeled them."" He relocated from Houston to St. Petersburg, Florida, and now works with Kiavi, a lender which offers bridge and rental loans to real estate investors along with a platform to track projects.""They are there for me with an answer to everything from 'What do you think about this?' to 'How will it help us?'"" he said. ""We've never missed a close, usually closing in ten days or less.""But this frenetic market has made every decision a little harder. ""It is a very hot market where there are multiple bids on every home on any given day."" He said the continued demand for housing, especially in Florida, is bringing in more investors. But he doesn't see a crash looming because so many people have equity. The brisk market means sometimes the plans for a property change very quickly.""We have a duplex we wanted to keep as a rental,"" he said. ""But we can get $150,000 more than its after repair value if we sell it. With the cash we bring in, we can buy two rentals.""CNN's Zachary Wasser and Sean Clark contributed to this report."
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/investing/microsoft-mergers/index.html,Microsoft is on a buying binge. Here's what it could buy next ,"By Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is on a major shopping spree.The company's planned purchase of video game maker Activision Blizzard, with a price tag of nearly $70 billion, is Microsoft's biggest and boldest acquisition. But it's hardly the only notable deal in the Nadella era.Microsoft (MSFT) scooped up advertising tech business Xandr from CNN owner AT&T (T) late last year for a reported $1 billion. The company also shelled out nearly $20 billion for cloud software firm Nuance earlier in 2021. That's on top of numerous other billion dollar deals Microsoft has made since Nadella took the helm in 2014, including the acquisitions of Minecraft developer Mojang, Bethesda games studio owner ZeniMax Media, open source coding site GitHub and business social media network LinkedIn. The LinkedIn deal was previously Microsoft's largest, with a value of $26.2 billion.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway perfectly timed an out-of-left-field investmentNow there are reports Microsoft is looking to buy Mandiant, the cybersecurity software firm formerly known as FireEye that is currently valued at about $4.5 billion. Read MoreMandiant CEO Kevin Mandia said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts last week that it won't comment on rumors or speculation. Microsoft had no comment either.It should come as no surprise that Microsoft might be looking to use some of the massive amount of cash it has on its balance sheet to close some deals. Microsoft has about $130 billion, and would still have around $60 billion left over after the Activision deal closes...assuming it is approved by regulators. The cybersecurity business is a major area of focus for Nadella. Last year, Microsoft bought several security startups, including CloudKnox Security, RiskIQ and CyberX. Security is a lucrative business for Microsoft since it generates a large chunk of recurring annual subscription revenue. It also helps Microsoft attract more corporate customers for its other numerous, cloud-based subscription software offerings.  So even if a Mandiant deal doesn't happen, Microsoft will likely set its sights elsewhere in the same space.""Cybercrime is the number one threat facing every business today,"" Nadella said during Microsoft's most recent earnings call with analysts last month. He added that cybersecurity revenue for Microsoft topped $15 billion over the past 12 months, a 45% jump from the previous year.Flush with cash, big companies are ready to buy up rivals and reward investorsMicrosoft chief financial officer Amy Hood also noted on a conference call with analysts following the Activision deal announcement that the company is looking for more deals in high-growth markets where Microsoft can ""uniquely add value to the users or the community."" She didn't name any industries that the company might be targeting. Microsoft isn't the only tech company on the hunt for deals. With interest rates likely headed higher over the next few months, other cash-rich tech firms may be propelled into action. Two others already have. Intel (INTC) announced Tuesday that it was buying Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) for $5.4 billion in cash. IBM (IBM) said Tuesday it was purchasing Neudesic, a cloud services consulting firm. Terms were not disclosed.And there are reports that Cisco Systems (CSCO) has made a $20 billion offer for Big Data firm Splunk (SPLK)."
us,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/tech/3g-network-shut-down/index.html,The 3G shutdown will affect everyday devices you probably own,"By Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN Business"," (CNN)The looming shutdown of 3G networks won't just impact older phones.With AT&T's 3G network shutting down next week, and other carriers following suit later this year, a range of products require updates to continue working, including some home alarm systems, medical devices such as fall detectors, and in-car crash notification and roadside assistance systems such as General Motors' OnStar.Just as many mobile carriers have urged customers to swap their older 3G iPhones, Android phones, e-readers and other handheld devices for newer models ahead of the shutdown, other businesses are urging customers to upgrade or replace some of the everyday products and services in their homes and cars before they drop connectivity. If left unaddressed, the stakes could be high in certain cases. Millions of cars, for example, may no longer have the ability to contact first responders after a collision or receive updates such as location or traffic alerts for built-in GPS systems. Some vehicles, including Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, have software upgrades for drivers to connect their systems to a 4G network, but other models will reportedly lose this feature for good.3G networks are shutting down soon. A scramble to get users to upgrade is underway The introduction of 3G in 2002 allowed some early car infotainment systems and home security services -- pioneers in the smart home space -- to connect to the networks. But over time, wireless companies moved on to 4G and more recently 5G networks. Read MoreNow, the major carriers are phasing out 3G technology in the United States and some markets abroad. AT&T (T), which owns CNN's parent company, is shutting it down on February 22; T-Mobile (TMUS) is doing so in the third quarter; and Verizon (VZ) will take this step by the end of the year. As the technology officially becomes obsolete, a scramble is underway to help consumers avoid a disruption.What companies are doing about itSome industries are better set up to handle the change. Many home security companies, for example, have been migrating their subscriber bases from 3G to 4G over the past two years. ""From the most recent industry discussions I've participated in, it appears most US home security dealers have migrated 100% or very close to 100% of their subscribers so it's not on most providers' to-do lists any longer,"" said Jack Narcotta, principal industry analyst at Strategy Analytics. He said the home security industry's effort to transition to 4G wasn't overly complicated because it simply involved having a technician install a box or panel for a newer model. Some companies such as ADT have also put additional resources into the transition. In 2020, the home security company acquired Cellbounce, which makes a device that converts 3G signals to 4G for AT&T's network. Security businesses, such as My Alarm Center, have been clear in their messaging to customers that replacement units were needed ahead of the shutdown, too. ""Even if your alarm appears to function, it will no longer communicate with our central service station to notify us that emergency services are needed,"" My Alarm Center states on its website.But even with these efforts, some customers and systems will likely get left behind -- and not just home security and car assistance services.""A few million connected devices in the smart home space still need to be replaced, including my meter for my solar panels,"" said Roger Entner, analyst and founder of Recon Analytics. ""Some companies started reaching out to their customers over the past 2 years informing them that service would soon shut off, but as of 6 months ago, many products still haven't gotten around to replacing them yet.""What is C-band 5G? Verizon and AT&T are flipping on the switch in the USThe auto industry is in more of a gray area. In addition to software upgrades, some automakers are offering consumers newer parts to add to existing technologies to get them running on 4G. But some are offering no accommodation at all. This is compounded by consumers likely being less aware of which network their car systems use than which network their phones use. ""A fair number of people are going to be surprised,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst with Guidehouse Insights, a market research firm focused on emerging technologies. ""But if they're currently a paying subscriber to a connectivity service, they most certainly have been notified at this point.""What you can do about itAs a general rule, most cars built in the last five years with connectivity are using 4G modems, according to Abuelsamid. Anyone who isn't sure if their vehicle is going to lose connectivity can call their local dealer for more information. If the car does use 3G, Abuelsamid recommended customers ask the manufacturer if there is an upgrade program and, failing that, contact the carriers, which can provide an adapter with a modem that can be plugged into a vehicle. For those who are unsure if their home alarm system runs on 3G, the security company likely has an FAQ page on its website with a list of impacted model numbers. Customers can also call the company directly to ask and arrange for next steps. Ultimately, it's much easier to replace some items that run on 3G than others. ""It's easier to replace a 3G e-reader if you want to keep cellular connectivity than it is to replace a car system, so some folks have an expensive decision to make if they want to keep their older auto connected with cellular,"" said Bill Menezes, director at market research firm Gartner. Future disruptionsIt's not the first time a network has been phased out nor will it be the last. The 3G shutdown is primarily intended to re-use the spectrum for 4G and 5G, which are newer standards, better technologies and more efficient. The same thing happened with 2G, which AT&T and Verizon shut down around the end of 2017; T-Mobile plans to shut its 2G network in December. Last month, AT&T and Verizon turned on C-band 5G networks, an important set of higher radio frequencies that will supercharge the internet. The change will allow users to, for example, stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds. (Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly one gigabyte per second, about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE.)In the home security world, 5G would give the ability to stream high-definition video or interactive mapping with motion detection so an alarm company could see where on a 3D map an alarm went off and track anything moving through the area. Moreover, 4G enables more sophisticated features, such as the ability to communicate with alarm companies faster and share pictures and rich videos over the network.For those worried about seeing 4G household devices phased out, don't be. Dimitris Mavrakis, a senior director at market research firm ABI Research, said the shut down of 4G networks won't happen anytime soon, noting ""other generations will likely remain in the market for a very long time."" Because 2G introduced mobile voice and 4G introduced mobile broadband, he calls 3G ""somewhere in between"" and ""not ideal for either voice or mobile broadband.""""Ultimately, 4G is a lot better than 3G,"" he said. ""This is why it's being phased out."""

Djokovic became embroiled in controversy earlier this year after attempting to enter Australia without a valid vaccination exemption.`The 20-time grand slam champion was later deported, missing out on an opportunity to play in the Australian Open.Before the tennis season's first grand slam Djokovic was tied with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer with 20 grand slam singles titles. With Djokovic absent, Nadal went on to win the Australian Open, giving him 21 major singles titles -- the most all-time in men's tennis.Djokovic told the BBC, which labeled the interview as an exclusive with the 34-year-old Serbian, that he has not received any vaccination for Covid-19.""I was never against vaccination,"" Djokovic told the BBC. ""I understand that globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus and seeing, hopefully, an end soon to this virus.""Read MoreDjokovic said in the BBC interview that he understands the consequences of his decision to not get vaccinated, explaining that: ""I understand that not being vaccinated today I'm unable to travel to most of the tournaments at the moment.""""And that's a price you're willing to pay?"" the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan asked Djokovic.""That is the price that I'm willing to pay,"" Djokovic replied.Rajan then asked Djokovic: ""Ultimately, are you prepared to forgo the chance to be the greatest player to ever picked up a racquet statistically because you feel so strongly about this jab?""""Yes,"" Djokovic said. ""I do.""When asked why, Djokovic responded: ""Because the principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else. I'm trying to be in tune with my body as much as I possibly can.""CNN has reached out to tournament organizers for the French Open and Wimbledon for comment.Djokovic departs the Park Hotel while under immigration detention, to convene with his legal team after his visa to play in the Australian Open was cancelled a second time, in Melbourne, Australia, January 16, 2022. Australian Open sagaDjokovic landed in Melbourne on January 5, only to be placed in temporary detention with his visa canceled because he did not have a valid medical exemption for the vaccination requirement for all arrivals.Djokovic's team argued the 34-year-old tennis star was under the impression he could enter the country because he had received a medical exemption from the tournament organizers, which had been granted on the grounds that he had natural immunity after being infected with Covid-19 in December.Under Australian law, medical exemptions are only given to people who can prove they've suffered anaphylaxis after a previous dose, or any component of a vaccine, or are significantly immunocompromised. Djovokic didn't fit either category.The following week, a judge quashed the government's decision to cancel his visa and ordered him to be freed, allowing Djokovic to resume training for the Australian Open.A man takes a selfie with Djokovic as he arrives at Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade, Serbia.However, in another twist just days before the tournament began, Australia's Immigration Minister Alex Hawke chose to cancel Djokovic's visa again, and the player was put back in detention.Hawke argued that Djokovic posed a risk to public health and order, and could encourage anti-vax protests, which could aid the spread of Covid-19.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosDuring the two-week period when all this unfolded, both supporters and critics of Djokovic took to the streets of Melbourne -- some protesting that his release made a mockery of the sacrifices Australians have made to contain Covid, others arguing he had a right to compete.Djokovic's legal challenge failed the second time around, with three Federal Court judges unanimously dismissing his application, saying Hawke's argument was not irrational. Djokovic left the country soon after."

In winning the Australian Open on Sunday after an epic final with Daniil Medvedev, the Spaniard claimed his 21st grand slam title, one more than Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. The three had been tied on 20 for a while, but after overcoming a long-running foot injury, Nadal now stands a step above the members of tennis' ""Big Three.""However, although he recognized his achievement in winning his record-breaking grand slam title, Nadal admitted it doesn't change his outlook on his career or legacy. ""No, I don't want to change my point of view, honestly. Of course, for me, it's amazing to achieve another grand slam at this moment of my career. Just means a lot to me,"" he told reporters. Read More""I feel honored. I feel lucky to achieve one more very special thing in my tennis career. I don't care much if I am the one or not the one or the best of the history, not the best of the history. Honestly, today, I don't care much. For me, it's about enjoying nights like today. That means everything for me, no? Means even more to achieve the second Australian Open more than any other thing.""So with Nadal looking like he's returning to his best tennis, with Federer continuing to struggle with injury and questions surrounding Djokovic's participation in future events due to his Covid-19 vaccination status, what could the future hold for the superstars of the sport? Nadal celebrates match point after beating Medvedev. 'I am proud to share this era with you'Nadal, Federer and Djokovic have lit up tennis over recent years, doing battle on numerous occasions and delivering some famous encounters. Both Federer and Djokovic were quick to congratulate Nadal on social media after his victory on Sunday. ""What a match! To my friend and great rival (Nadal), heartfelt congratulations on becoming the first man to win 21 Grand Slam titles,"" Federer wrote on his Instagram stories. ""A few months ago, we were joking about both being on crutches. Amazing. Never underestimate a great champion. Your incredible work ethic, dedication and fighting spirit are an inspiration to me and countless others around the world. ""I am proud to share this era with you and honored to play a role in pushing you to achieve more, as you have done for me for the past 18 years. I am sure you have more achievements ahead but for now enjoy this one!""Djokovic wrote on Twitter: ""Congratulations to (Nadal) for 21st GS. Amazing achievement. Always impressive fighting spirit that prevailed another time. Enhorabuena. (Medvedev) gave it his all out there and played with the passion and determination we have come to expect from him.""The 40-year-old Federer has been struggling with a knee injury, which is the reason he's been absent from the court. World No. 1 Djokovic -- arguably the favorite to win the tournament beforehand -- was deported from Australia after losing a court challenge against the Australian government's decision to cancel his visa on public health and order grounds.The second grand slam of the year is the French Open at Roland Garros which begins on May 22. Nadal, now returning to full fitness, is sure to be the heavy favorite on the clay courts of Paris having won a record 13 French Open titles. Djokovic's availability at the grand slam in France is still in doubt as the country's Sports Ministry told CNN earlier in January that all professional athletes who wish to compete in France will have to be vaccinated against Covid-19.France's vaccine pass law, approved by parliament in January, will require people to have a vaccine certificate to enter public places such as restaurants, cafes, cinemas and sports arenas, among others.""The rule is simple. The vaccine pass will be required once the law comes into force in institutions that were already subject to the health pass (sporting or cultural). This will apply to everyone (spectators, professional sportspeople),"" a French Sports Ministry spokeswoman told CNN.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosNadal poses with the Australian Open men's singles final trophy in the locker room.That new legislation puts the chances of Djokovic, who has not been vaccinated against Covid-19, competing at Roland Garros in jeopardy.Nadal and Federer are older though than the 34-year-old Djokovic -- Nadal is 35 and Federer is 40 -- meaning the Serbian does have time on his side to be able to try and catch Nadal. But with a new crop of tennis superstars blossoming at the moment -- with Medvedev at the forefront alongside Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Andrey Rublev, Casper Ruud and Felix Auger-Aliassime amongst others -- staying at the top has never been more difficult for tennis' greatest ever players.

There had been major doubts about whether or not Nadal would even be fit enough to play at the Australian Open after missing the second half of 2021 with a foot injury.However, he returned to action at the Melbourne Summer Set tournament at the beginning of January, going on to win his first ATP title since May 2021.After beating Matteo Berrettini in the Australian Open semifinal, Nadal said he was just happy to be back on the court after being beset by injuries.Read MoreAs he sank to the floor, exhausted but victorious after five-and-a-half enthralling hours, Nadal proved he was not only fit enough to still compete at grand slams, but could realistically still win several more.""It has been one of the most emotional matches in my tennis career and to share the court with you [Medvedev] was an honor,"" Nadal said in his on court interview.

At the other end of the court, Medvedev looked like he'd barely broken a sweat.Indeed, Nadal's serve was broken to love in his very next service game as Medvedev took a 3-2 lead. Things were looking ominous.Two more easy holds followed, as did another easy break of Nadal's serve, as Medvedev closed out the first set without dropping another game.Daniil Medvedev comfortably took the first set against Nadal.Nadal fights backNadal desperately needed to try something different in the second set; Medvedev was hitting the ball harder and more cleanly and felt like the favorite to win each point at the start of every rally.The Spaniard opened the second set with a relatively comfortable hold of serve -- perhaps his only one of the match so far -- celebrating with a shout of ""si"" and a fist pump towards his box as he attempted to fire himself up.It clearly worked as Nadal earned his first break of the match in Medevedev's next service game -- and he was really made to earn it.Nadal ended a mammoth 40-shot rally with a quite ridiculous sliced backhand that Medvedev couldn't get anywhere near to open up a 15-40 lead, eventually breaking serve with his second break point to go 3-1 up.However, after an easy hold of serve, Medvedev held his own serve before breaking Nadal back -- much to the despair of the boisterous crowd on Rod Laver.This match, though, was becoming unpredictable and Nadal broke Medvedev's serve once again to take a 5-3 lead and give himself the chance to serve for the second set. To make matters more complicated, an incident in the stands forced a number of security guards to come onto the court and stand around the two players as a man apparently attempted to jump onto the court.Rafael Nadal rallied in the second set.In keeping with the rest of the match, it was a brutal game that lasted more than 12 minutes and it was Medvedev that came out on top, finally breaking back with his fifth break point to make it 4-5 and deny Nadal the set.The pair exchanged holds of serve until the set reached a tie break. Nadal had done well to make this match a contest, but winning this set was felt crucial to ensuring the final would go the distance.The Spaniard has produced some Herculean efforts throughout his career, but coming from two sets down here was surely beyond him. Wasn't it?As the clock ticked over the two hour mark, both players continued to produce outstanding tennis but it was once again Medvedev who got the better of Nadal.One crucial point in the tie breaker -- with Nadal leading 5-4 -- went to the Russian as Nadal's volley dropped just wide. The hawkeye system confirmed the line judge's call, but the decision was still roundly booed by the crowd.After Medvedev hit the backhand winner that earned him the tie break and deflated the crowd, he turned to look at the stands and raised his arms above his head as a mixture of cheers and jeers rained down.Daniil Medvedev was cheered and jeered after winning the second set.Down, but never outDespite the bitter disappointment, Nadal began the second set strongly and had a wonderful chance to give himself two early break point, but a less than perfect approach shot allowed Medvedev to hit a huge backhand winner that flashed past his opponent at the net.Nadal glanced up at his box with a worried look on his face, knowing how costly these squandered opportunities would be.The set -- and the match -- soon looked like it was over with Nadal 0-40 down while serving at 2-3.But the Mallorcan has forged a reputation as one of the biggest warriors on the court and, even now in twilight of his career, there are no signs of that fight fading.Nadal clawed his way back to deuce, before eventually winning the game to level the third set.The momentum of this final swung dramatically with Medvedev serving at 4-4, as nerves seemed to be getting the better of the Russian as he approached the finish line.One bizarre attempt at a drop shot resulted in the ball hitting the net and Medvedev sarcastically applauded the crowd, who he felt had made noise before he hit the shot, leading to a loud chorus of boos.Rafael Nadal takes in the crowd after hitting a winner.Nadal broke his opponent with an incredible backhand passing shot down the line and the Rod Laver arena erupted -- it was by some distance the loudest sound of the night.Unlike in the second set, Nadal held serve with ease thanks to four straight winners to make it 2-1 and Medvedev appeared to be rattled.During the changeover, he told the umpire that some fans were ""idiots with empty brains"" after one supporter had shouted just before Nadal was going to serve.The comeback is onThe momentum continued to swing further in Nadal's favor at the start of the fourth set, as the Spaniard somehow managed to save two break points to make it 1-1.Medvedev had certainly allowed to let the fans get inside his head, as a double fault to hand Nadal a break of serve ended with him sarcastically applauding and putting his thumb up to the crowd.The Russian calmed himself down during the change of ends and responded with an immediate break back, leading the area to burst into a chorus of ""let's go, Rafa, let's go.""However, he just couldn't stop a resurgent Nadal. Medvedev managed to take his next service game to deuce after being 0-40 down, but Nadal was relentless in his pursuit of another break of serve and eventually got it at the seventh time of asking to end another marathon game.Nadal was now playing some of the best tennis of his life -- and it had to be that good to beat his opponent -- holding his next service game to take a 4-2 lead in the fourth.Medvedev had also called the trainer to massage his right thigh and at times he appeared to be in a little discomfort when moving that leg.Daniil Medvedev looked to be struggling at the back of the court.Nadal's next service game was the biggest of the set, as he rattled off four straight points from 15-40 down to make it 5-3.Medvedev managed to hold the next game, fending off a set point, but it was just delaying the inevitable as Nadal closed it out with a faultless service game. This match was quickly turning into one of the all-time great grand slam finals.Rafa returnsMedvedev had to dig deep again at the beginning of the fifth set, saving another early break point. It was the 12th break point he'd saved in the match, a new record for the Russian.There was seemingly now no stopping Nadal, as he broke his opponent's serve once again to take a 3-2 lead -- perhaps for the first time he would allow himself to start thinking about number 21.Nadal ensured, for the time being, that Medvedev didn't get back into the set, saving multiple break points in a game that went to deuce six times to make it 4-2.The match clock now showed these two show stoppers had been battling it out for five hours, yet neither player looked like dropping their level any time soon.Nadal was soon serving at 5-4 to win the championship and had a 30-0 lead, seemingly on the cusp of creating history. However, Medvedev dug deeper still to win four straight points and break back at the most vital of moments.Rafael Nadal lifts a historic 21st grand slam trophy.However, Nadal was just not going to be denied his record title. He broke back immediately, perhaps playing his best tennis of the final, and then had his second chance at serving for the championship.It was a chance he wouldn't squander again, holding his nerve expertly to etch his name into the history books.Given where he was just sixth months ago, at times pondering retirement, Nadal's victory here in Melbourne will go down as one of tennis' greatest wins."

""I'm a fortunate and lucky girl to have so much love in my corner, we started together right from the start. We did it all together, nobody has changed from our team. I love you to death.""As an Aussie the most important part of this tournament is being able to share it with so many people and the crowd, you have been nothing short of exceptional.""This crowd is one of the most fun I've ever played in front of and you guys brought me so much joy today and helped me play my best tennis, so thanks for all your love and support over the last couple of weeks.""This is a dream come true for me and I am so proud to be an Aussie. See you next time.""READ: Rafael Nadal is one win away from record-breaking grand slam title after reaching Australian Open finalAustralia's Ashleigh Barty celebrates after beating Danielle Collins.Blistering startNeither player showed any signs of nerves in the opening stages and exchanged some blistering shots early on.Collins' trademark backhand was causing Barty all sorts of problems, with the Aussie struggling to contain the powerful groundstroke as it ripped through the Rod Laver court.However, Barty was able to respond on her own serve, crushing an early 181km/h ace past her opponent as she managed to save an early break point -- much to the delight of the crowd.The partisan home support was certainly showing its allegiances early on, erupting each time Barty won a point. They were then really given something to cheers in Collins' third service game, as a couple of loose groundstrokes and a wild double fault gifted Barty a break of serve.That certainly helped release any tension Barty was still feeling, as the home favorite ripped off two more holds of serve to claim the opening set in the blink of an eye.Even Collins' reaching the final is one of the most remarkable comeback stories in tennis.In April last year, she underwent emergency surgery for endometriosis -- a condition where the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of it -- and had suffered an abdominal injury at the French Open.Danielle Collins began dominating the second set.The 28-year-old has spoken candidly about the excruciating pain she endured, describing it as some of the worst she has experienced.Collins has credited the surgeon for saving her career and she's now playing some of the best tennis of her life, with her run to final in Melbourne projected to push her into the world's top 10 for the first time.Huge credit must go to the player for remaining unperturbed that a close opening set had gotten away from her so quickly.The American often wears her heart on her sleeve on the court, but had so far kept her emotions hidden on the biggest occasion of her career.However, that changed at the start of the second set as Barty once again began to struggle with her opponent's powerful shots, which now seemed to have just a little more sting.Two uncharacteristic errors from Barty in her opening service game of the set allowed Collins to break for the first time in the match. Rod Laver arena fell largely silent, save for Collins' roar. ""Come on,"" she shouted, fist clenched towards her box.It had been quite a remarkable change in momentum from the opening set, with Collins now dominating almost every rally.The fans did their fans to rally behind Barty in the second set.The crowd, sensing Barty's nerves, did their best to get her back into the match; one forehand winner down the line was greeted with the perhaps the loudest cheer of the night so far.However, it wasn't enough to get Barty back on track as the size of the occasion now seemed to be weighing heavily on her.The forehand was becoming wild and erratic and Collins found another break of serve to seemingly put the set out of her opponent's reach.But Barty, the fighter that she is on the court, battled back and recovered one of those breaks of serve, before firing off a love service game to pile the pressure back onto Collins.It was pressure Collins couldn't handle as her first serve and usually trusty backhand deserted her, gifting Barty a second break of serve.The Rod Laver arena, which had been subdued for most of the second set, erupted and was now louder than it had been all evening. Barty claims the third grand slam title of her career.At one point, Collins seemed unhappy with a number of the people in the crowd who had begun shouting before the points were finished, leading the umpire to warn those in attendance about their conduct.Barty held serve to level the scores at 5-5 and what looked like 20 minutes ago was going to be a walkover set for Collins had now turned into a slugfest.Both players put in solid service games to take the set to a tie break, though Collins must have been wishing those first serves had come a couple of games earlier.Barty raced into 4-0 lead in the tie break and never looked like losing it from there, eventually closing it out 7-2 -- and it was now party time on Rod Laver.After waiting 44 long years, Australia once again has its own grand slam singles champion."

The headline act? 'Special K,' otherwise known as Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis. The Australian wildcard duo have whipped fans into a frenzy throughout their unlikely journey into the semifinals of their home grand slam, peaking with a raucous 7-5 3-6 6-3 quarterfinal victory over Tim Puetz and Michael Venus at a packed Kia Arena on Tuesday.Hype men to the crowd, chest bumps, Cristiano Ronaldo tribute acts -- to highlight the tennis alone would not do justice to the spectacle the Australian pair have provided.Read MoreKyrgios and Kokkinakis have brought a new level of showmanship to the Australian Open doubles competition.Arguably doubles has an awkward place in the tennis world -- with singles events consistently taking precedence in both prize money and coverage -- which makes the attention and adulation that the duo are garnering all the more impressive.Yet for Kyrgios and Kokkinakis, their relationship with the crowd is a symbiotic one, and forms the crux of their motivation to perform.""This Australian Open, honestly for us, it's more about the people -- playing for them is more important than our doubles success, Kyrgios said.""We haven't drawn up any goals of what we wanna achieve this year in doubles, I just wanna play and give the people of Australia and the Australian Open a show and genuinely try and grow the sport of tennis. ""That's why I'm playing, and I know Thanasi is just enjoying it -- this is the most fun we've ever had on the court.""The thrill for us is honestly walking out there. This sounds stupid but we worry what happens in the match after,"" Kokkinakis added.""Seeing the support we've got and then the crowd going nuts every time we go out there and how much they're enjoying it, that gets us going and gets us motivated to do better for them.""Kyrgios (bottom C) gives a racket to a boy he had hit with a tennis ball.Tears and cheersA perfect encapsulation of the pair's connection with the Melbourne crowd -- as well as Kyrgios' enigmatic personality -- came early in the first set of the quarterfinal when the 26-year-old ferociously lashed a returning dead ball into the crowd after a let serve.The ball struck a child, bringing him to tears, with a mortified Kyrgios covering his mouth in shock. After a brief chat with Kokkinakis, Kyrgios jogged over to the stand to hand over a token of apology to a boy who -- though admittedly still a little watery-eyed -- now brandished a smile, a new racket, and a monster of a story to share at school. The subsequent warm ripple of applause from the crowd was a response the oft-dubbed 'bad boy of tennis' has not always received. On court antics have at times marred an undoubtedly talented career -- an immaturity he admits to -- with Kyrgios telling CNN last year that he had a ""love-hate"" relationship with the sport.Six years after his grandmother passed away, Nick Kyrgios grapples with demonsYet this doubles run looks to have really fired up Kyrgios and there can be no doubt which side of ""love-hate"" this year's crowd falls on -- especially the swathe of young fans that have packed into the duo's games at Melbourne Park.""There's no way around it, me and Thanasi are definitely role models to the youth in Australia, we obviously attract that crowd,"" Kyrgios said.""I know that over the years i haven't been the best role model but I was just learning how to deal with everything and i think now at 26 i've matured and I definitely realized that a lot of young kids and people -- even people that are low on confidence -- they do look towards us when we go out there.""We're not special people, we're normal humans that you might see walking in Australia ... I think we're just relatable, that's what's the best thing about it.""Kokkinakis (L) and Kyrgios celebrate after beating Puetz and Venus.RelatableFor the 26-year-old Krygios, difference is the keyword to his place in the sport.""Tennis has always had personalities, I've said this before but I think they just struggled to understand that there are different ways to go about it. ""You've got Roger Federer and these guys that are just once in a generation athletes -- I can't be like that, we're not like that, there has to be people that are a little more relatable.""Ability aside, Krygios and Kokkinakis are putting on a once in a generation spectacle at the Australian Open -- just spare a thought for Melbourne's lovers of peace and quiet should they go all the way.

The ruling said it was open to the minister to infer Djokovic's presence could encourage anti-vax protests, which could aid the spread of Covid-19. And they noted the minister's decision also included the star's possible influence on people who were unsure about whether to take the vaccine.""The possible influence on the second group comes from common sense and human experience: An iconic world tennis star may influence people of all ages, young or old, but perhaps especially the young and the impressionable, to emulate him. This is not fanciful; it does not need evidence,"" the ruling said.Read MoreThe explanation ends one of the most controversial episodes in the history of the Australian Open.The world's No. 1 men's player was forced to leave the country on the eve of the competition after the court failed to find fault with the immigration minister's decision to cancel his visa.It was the second time Djokovic's visa had been canceled -- the first came in the hours after his arrival in Australia on January 5, when Australian Border Force (ABF) officers rejected his purported exemption from rules that state all new arrivals must be fully vaccinated.Djokovic said a previous Covid infection meant he was exempt, but under federal rules that's not enough and he was detained in an immigration facility.The matter went to court and a single judge ruled the decision was ""unreasonable"" because he wasn't given enough time to consult his lawyers. Djokovic was freed from detention and resumed his training at Melbourne Park in the hope of securing his 21st grand slam title.However, days later the government intervened to cancel his visa again, stating the unvaccinated player was a threat to public health and order. The issue was referred to a higher court and the three judges convened last Sunday.Djokovic's legal team didn't argue the merits of the minister's decision, only that he had made a jurisdictional error under the country's migration law.On Sunday, the judges ruled there had been no error and Djokovic agreed to leave.In a statement, the player said he was ""disappointed"" with the decision but respected the court's ruling. That night he departed Melbourne en route to Serbia, where he received a hero's welcome.Fans wave Serbian flags as tennis player Novak Djokovic arrives in Belgrade on Monday, January 17.Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said Australia's treatment of the star was ""scandalous."" Brnabic told CNN Wednesday she didn't know why Djokovic wasn't vaccinated, but added she doesn't believe he's an anti-vaxxer.""He supports the vaccination of those people who want to be vaccinated. So I am not perceiving him as anti-vaxxer,"" she said. In a statement soon after Sunday's ruling, Djokovic's family blamed the decision on politics. ""This isn't just a sports issue and playing at the first grand slam of the season, dominated by Novak for a decade now, but politics as well all the interests that took priority over sports,"" the statement said. Under Australian law, Djokovic can be banned from the country for three years, though Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews hasn't ruled out an exemption. ""Any application will be reviewed on its merits,"" she said earlier this week.On Tuesday, Tennis Australia expressed regret the visa dispute had distracted players in the tournament.""We deeply regret the impact this had on all players,"" the statement said. ""There are always lessons to learn, and we will review all aspects of our preparation and implementation to inform our planning -- as we do every year. That process always starts once the Australian Open champions have lifted their trophies.""The grand slam ends on January 31."

During the tournament, Efremova's mother received the news that her husband was soon going to lose that battle.Julia says she had to make the difficult decision about whether to tell Efremova during the tournament or wait until it was over.""It was very tough, but Ksenia was in the tournament and I had to tell her,"" she says.

The evening before, a building in Belgrade was illuminated with the words ""Nole [Djokovic's nickname], you are the pride of Serbia."" The Serbian Olympic Committee said it was ""very disappointed"" over Australia's ""scandalous decision"" to deport Djokovic, adding that a ""huge injustice"" had been committed, while Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said the visa cancellation was ""scandalous.""Djokovic lands in Belgrade having been deported from Melbourne.

The 25-year-old couldn't have hoped for a better script for any potential entry she pens for January 17 as she won her opening match 6-3 6-3 against Colombian Camila Osorio on Rod Laver Arena.Osaka, who is the 13th seed in this year's draw, raced into a 5-0 lead in the opening set on Monday before some spirited play from 20-year-old Osorio and a few unforced errors allowed her a route into the match. The Japanese star did eventually manage to clinch the first set. In the second set, Osorio had two early break points but was unable to take advantage. Osaka broke into a 3-1 lead and a stray Osorio backhand into the net finally gave Osaka the victory to get her title defense off to the perfect start. Read More""I thought I played pretty well given the circumstances, I didn't have a lot of information about my opponent,"" said Osaka in her on-court interview.She added: ""I hope that we gave you a really good performance. It always feels very special for me to come back here. I have a lot of really good memories here.""Osaka plays a forehand against Osorio during their women's singles match on day one of the Australian Open.Osaka will face Madison Brengle in the second round after the American advanced when Dayana Yastremska retired trailing 1-6 6-0 0-5.Earlier this month Osaka played her first match in four months after she took a break from tennis after a defeat to Leylah Fernandez at the US Open Last year, she also withdrew from the French Open, citing mental health issues, and chose not to participate at Wimbledon.The four-time grand slam champion said she is prioritizing her enjoyment on the court during her time in Melbourne. ""I can't expect myself to win every match, but I do expect myself to have fun and challenge myself,"" she said. ""I'm here because I want to be here and because I find that it's fun for me.""I accept the fact that I'll have dips, and I need to figure out a way to overcome it.""Osaka celebrates her match point against Osorio.Could this be the year?

In what was his 70th win at the competition, Nadal continued his fast start to 2022 on the Rod Laver Arena. Having missed the end of the 2021 season thanks to a foot injury, Nadal won the Melbourne Summer Set title two weeks ago, his first tournament win on Australian soil since the Australian Open in 2009. Novak Djokovic is 'the best player in the history of men's tennis' but he is leaving a 'complicated' legacy off the courtAnd the 35-year-old maintained his good form against Giron, a dominant 24-minute first set setting the tone. Nadal continued to keep his foot down throughout, breezing past world No. 66 Giron without too much fuss. Nadal is the only former champion left in the draw -- with Novak Djokovic deported and Roger Federer injured -- meaning he can become the men's all-time grand slam record winner by winning in Melbourne. And he stressed the importance of winning last week at the Melbourne Summer Set after beating Giron. ""Last week had been important for me. I played three matches, I won three matches. I won a title, it's always beautiful,"" Nadal said. ""And I think I am doing better and better.

Hawke said those rules had kept Australians ""safe"" during the pandemic and were ""fundamental"" in ""safe-guarding Australia's social cohesion.""""Australians have made great sacrifices to get to this point,"" the statement said.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison echoed his message in a statement to the media.""This cancellation decision was made on health, safety and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so. I welcome the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe,"" he said.""I thank the Court for their prompt attention to these issues and the patience of all involved as we have worked to resolve this issue. It's now time to get on with the Australian Open and get back to enjoying tennis over the summer.""Although Covid-19 cases are rising in Australia, the country has a high rate of vaccination and its death toll from Covid-19 remains relatively low compared to other countries. Last week the country surpassed 1 million Covid-19 cases over the entire pandemic -- but more than half of those were in the last two weeks.What happened in courtSunday's hastily convened Federal Court hearing considered whether Hawke's decision to cancel Djokovic's visa was ""unreasonable.""The 34-year-old Serbian tennis star challenged the immigration minister's decision on three grounds, including that the minister failed to properly consider the consequences of canceling his visa.Djokovic's barrister Nick Wood said Hawke's decision was ""irrational"" as the minister had failed to consider that the act itself could galvanize anti-vaxxers -- the very thing the government wanted to prevent.But Stephen Lloyd, the lawyer for Hawke, said under Australia's Migration Law the minister didn't need to prove Djokovic was a risk to public health, just that he ""might"" be.He said Djokovic's anti-vax attitudes were apparent by his failure to be vaccinated, despite having an opportunity to do so before arriving in Australia. He added that the perception that Djokovic opposed vaccination was enough to risk inciting anti-vaxxers in the country, and that the tennis star's apparent disregard for Covid-19 rules meant there was a risk others would emulate his actions and ignore public health orders.Tennis Australia, the national governing body for tennis and organizer of the Australian Open tournament, said it ""respects the decision of the Federal Court"" regarding Djokovic's visa.Djokovic has been replaced in the draw by Italian Salvatore Caruso, who will face Serbian player Miomir Kecmanović.The ATP described the decision to uphold the cancellation of Djokovic's visa as ""the end of a deeply regrettable series of events"" and said his absence from the Australian Open was ""a loss for the game.""A long-running sagaThe saga began nearly two weeks ago, when Djokovic's visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival on January 5. Under current Australian laws, all international arrivals are required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 -- which Djokovic is not -- unless they have a medical exemption.Djokovic said he was under the impression he could enter because two independent panels associated with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government had granted him an exemption on the grounds that he had been infected with Covid-19 in December.What we know: Novak Djokovic and Australian Open timeline  The federal government argued that, under its rules, previous infection with Covid-19 is not a valid reason for an exemption.On his arrival in Australia, Djokovic was taken to the Park Hotel in Melbourne, which is also used as a detention center for refugees, while lawyers prepared a case to overturn the decision.On Monday, Judge Anthony Kelly ruled that border officers had been ""unreasonable"" when they canceled his initial visa to enter Australia and ordered Djokovic to be freed from immigration detention.Djokovic's visa was revoked for the second time on Friday by Hawke, but the government agreed not to deport the tennis star over the weekend before his case had concluded.Despite a verdict finally being reached in court, the events over the last two weeks still split opinion and the fallout can be expected to continue for days to come. It is unclear when Djokovic will take to the court again after he said he was taking ""some time to rest and to recuperate, before making any further comments beyond this.""He will have the chance to break the men's grand slam title record at the French Open in May but the saga has raised questions about how unvaccinated players will compete on the season's tour. It also threatens to tarnish Djokovic's incredible achievement in the sport with the issue still proving divisive around the world.

The tournament, however, has largely been overshadowed by the high-profile saga off the court, pitting one of tennis's biggest stars against Australia's government and public health officials.Djokovic's visa was revoked for the second time on Friday by Alex Hawke, Australia's immigration minister, but the government has agreed not to deport Djokovic over the weekend before his case has concluded.Djokovic's lawyer, Nicholas Wood told the court that the immigration minister had used his personal power to cancel the 34-year-old's visa based on grounds he would ""excite anti-vax sentiment"" should he remain in Australia, describing it as a ""radically different approach"" in the government's argument. ""The underlying new rationale is not a direct risk to others, it's that Mr Djokovic being in Australia, in Melbourne in particular, by being here will excite anti-vax sentiment. That's the point. A radically different approach,"" Wood said. 'It's not a good situation': How the world reacted after Novak Djokovic has visa canceled again Under current Australian laws, all international arrivals are required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 -- which Djokovic is not -- unless they have a medical exemption.Djokovic said he was under the impression he could enter because two independent panels associated with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government had granted him an exemption on the grounds that he had been infected with Covid-19 in December. The federal government argued that, under its rules, previous infection with Covid-19 is not a valid reason for an exemption.Djokovic's legal team challenged the Friday ruling, and the case was transferred up the chain to Australia's Federal Court. After an emergency hearing Friday, Judge Kelly ruled that Djokovic would have to submit to an interview with the Australian Border Force at an undisclosed location. Kelly ordered authorities to then place Djokovic in detention and escort him to his lawyer's office while his case appears before the Federal Court. Djokovic's visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival on January 5, but Kelly ruled earlier this week that border officers had been ""unreasonable"" when they canceled his initial visa to enter Australia. The judge then ordered Djokovic to be freed from immigration detention."

Australia's federal court is a higher body than the court Kelly presided over.""Today I exercised my power under section 133C(3) of the Migration Act to cancel the visa held by Mr Novak Djokovic on health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so,"" said Hawke in a statement earlier on Friday. Read More""In making this decision, I carefully considered information provided to me by the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Border Force (ABF) and Mr Djokovic. The Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting Australia's borders, particularly in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.""The decision comes four days after judge Kelly ruled that  Australian Border Force (ABF) officers had been ""unreasonable"" when they canceled his initial visa to enter Australia on his arrival in the country on January 5. The judge ordered Djokovic be freed from immigration detention within 30 minutes.The second cancellation is the latest twist in a saga that has garnered global headlines and put Australia's Covid and immigration policies under scrutiny. Novak Djokovic is 'the best player in the history of men's tennis' but he is leaving a 'complicated' legacy off the courtUnder current Australian laws, all international arrivals are required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 -- which Djokovic is not -- unless they have a medical exemption. Djokovic said he was under the impression he could enter because two independent panels associated with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government had granted him an exemption on the grounds that he had been infected with Covid-19 in December.The federal government argued that, under its rules, previous infection with Covid-19 is not a valid reason for an exemption.Despite Monday's ruling, the immigration minister retained ministerial power to personally intervene in the case and ultimately had the final say as to whether Djokovic would be allowed to stay, though his decision can be appealed. In his ruling, the judge noted that if Djokovic had been deported, he would have been banned from Australia for three years. However this can be waived in special circumstances.Minister for Immigration Alex Hawke used his executive powers to cancel Djokovic's visa.Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the minister's decision to cancel Djokovic's visa protected ""sacrifices"" Australian had made throughout the pandemic. In a statement, Morrison said the ""pandemic has been incredibly difficult for every Australian but we have stuck together and saved lives and livelihoods.""""Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected,"" he said. ""This is what the minister is doing in taking this action today.""Djokovic to be detainedDjokovic will be interviewed by the ABF at 8 a.m. local time on Saturday (Friday 4 p.m. ET) at an undisclosed location ""agreed between the parties"" in the case. At that point, Djokovic will be officially detained by two border force officials and escorted to his lawyers' office while his case is heard in the federal court. The location where Djokovic will be met by border officials will remain secret in order to keep the tennis star safe and prevent ""a media circus.""""We have a genuine concern about security and a potential media circus,"" Djokovic's barrister Nick Wood told the court when imploring Judge Kelly to allow Djokovic to be handed over to border officials in private.

How it came to thisDjokovic arrived in Melbourne on January 5 and promptly had his visa canceled for entering the country without a valid reason why he couldn't be vaccinated against Covid-19.He spent several nights in a detention hotel in Melbourne, which also houses dozens of refugees -- some of whom have been held in immigration detention for more than eight years.His lawyers challenged the decision and won the legal battle on Monday, but since then questions have emerged over Djokovic's behavior after testing positive for Covid-19 on December 16.In a statement published to social media on Wednesday, Djokovic acknowledged he did not immediately isolate after receiving a positive diagnosis -- but denied knowing he had the virus when attending several public events.Djokovic admits he didn't immediately isolate after positive Covid test, as Australia probes possible discrepancies in testsHe also apologized for apparently false information on his Australia visa declaration, specifically that he hadn't traveled in the 14 days before his arrival in the country. Photos taken during that period appear to show him in both Spain and Serbia.Djokovic said a member of his support staff submitted the information and the omission had been ""human error.""In the statement, Djokovic also admitted doing an interview and photo shoot with a French sports newspaper while Covid positive, which he conceded was an ""error of judgment.""The visa dispute and decision whether to allow Djokovic -- who has previously voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates --  into the country comes at a time when Covid-19 case numbers are soaring.On Friday, the state of Victoria -- home to Melbourne where the Australian Open is being held -- reported 34,836 cases, with a record 976 people hospitalized with Covid-19. This week the country surpassed one million cases over the entire pandemic.What could come nextMaria Jockel, legal principal of BDO Migration Services, said Djokovic's lawyers will have 28 days to make representations to the minister, stating why he should reverse his decision.Despite his visa being canceled once again, experts say it is still possible Djokovic could be released on another visa to contest the Australian Open.Novak Djokovic's fans are fighting to get him out of his hotel. Inside, refugees wonder if they'll ever leave""If there's an incredible outcry about having the world's No. 1 tennis player in detention whilst the Australian Open is on, maybe the government would relent and let him out on a bridging visa,"" said Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary with the immigration department.A bridging visa would allow Djokovic to work -- or, in this case, play -- but the political repercussions of that decision are unclear as it would seem to contradict the message that Djokovic poses a health risk to the Australian people.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said earlier Friday the issue had a simple solution: ""Just get vaccinated.""""That is the key ... That's what I say to every single Victorian. That's what I've done. That's what my kids have done,"" he said, adding the Australian Open was bigger than one player and the issue far bigger than one person.CNN Tennis Contributor Ben Rothenberg and CNN's Angus Watson, Jessie Yeung and Ivana Kottasová contributed.

Djokovic won his first grand slam title at the Australian Open in 2008, after which he had to wait three years for his next major triumph, again at the Australian Open. Grand slam titles -- 11 in total -- came thick and fast in the six-year period between 2011 and 2016, culminating in Djokovic claiming the ""Nole Slam"" as the defending champion of all four grand slam tournaments at the same time. But an elbow injury in 2017 derailed Djokovic's progress. His initial unwillingness to undergo surgery frustrated his former coach Andre Agassi, who told The Guardian he thought Djokovic had hoped his elbow would ""heal naturally, holistically.""Djokovic eventually opted for surgery in early 2018 and returned to the court a few months later, but it was a setback that had almost led to him quitting tennis altogether. ""To do the surgery, it was against his core values,"" his wife Jelena told CNN in 2019. ""It was really huge, it's like he buried one part of him with that decision. He said: 'I'm done, I'm not playing tennis anymore, I lost this, I'm not having fun anymore, this is it.'""Since that elbow surgery, Djokovic has won eight grand slam titles across a four-year period, eventually equaling Federer and Nadal's record at Wimbledon last year. Many see it as only a matter of time before he owns the record outright and establishes himself as the greatest player in the history of men's tennis -- a titan on the court with a complicated, controversial legacy off it.CNN's Christina Macfarlane, Don Riddell, Ben Church, Hannah Ritchie, Jessie Yeung and Angus Watson contributed to reporting.

Hopefully he can play.

Voracova was detained last Thursday in the same hotel as Djokovic before she left the country on Saturday.Speaking to Reuters in a video call, Voracova said she went through immigration without facing any problems and believed she would have been competing at the Australian Open if the furore around Djokovic's visa and his vaccination status had not erupted.""I was there already for one week and since he arrived things changed,"" she said.

Following hours of deliberations, technical glitches and arguments from both sides, Justice Anthony Kelly ordered Djokovic to be released from a temporary hotel detention facility and his possessions returned within 30 minutes of the Monday ruling.Justice Kelly also ordered the respondent in the case -- the Australian Ministry of Home Affairs -- to pay Djokovic's legal costs. Following the decision, a lawyer for the government said Australia's Minister for Immigration reserves the right to personally intervene in the case. Christopher Tran, acting for the government, said Minister Alex Hawke retains ministerial power to remove Djokovic from the country, despite the ruling. After the hearing, Djokovic tweeted that he was ""pleased and grateful"" at the outcome. He said that ""despite all that has happened,"" he wants to remain in country to ""try to compete"" in the Australian Open. He also thanked his supporters for standing with him and encouraging him to ""stay strong.""

The following day, he was also photographed at a youth awards event.The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) called the series of events leading up to the hearing ""damaging on all fronts"" -- including to the athlete's well-being, according to a statement from the association on Monday.The earlier ruling, held via video link at the Australian Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne, comes after days of speculation and public anger about whether the tennis star would be able to play in the Australian Open, despite being unvaccinated for Covid-19. The 34-year-old Serb flew to Australia on January 5, only to have his visa canceled after Australian Border Force deemed his medical exemption from requirements that all arrivals be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 was invalid. Faced with deportation and his hopes of winning a record 21st grand slam in jeopardy, Djokovic launched a legal challenge.People are seen outside the Law Court building on January 10, 2022 in Melbourne, Australia. During the hearing, Djokovic's legal team argued he had obtained the required medical exemption to travel to Australia and bypass vaccination restrictions for Covid-19. That exemption had been granted on the grounds that Djokovic had natural immunity after being infected with Covid-19 in December, his defense argued.Djokovic, who has previously voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates, was unvaccinated when he arrived in Australia. In his ruling, the judge noted that if Djokovic had been deported, he would have been banned from Australia for three years.The case has attracted worldwide attention and sparked anger from both his supporters and critics, with some saying his case shows celebrities are getting special treatment when it comes to Australia's tough Covid-19 rules, which have seen families separated for years, and others who believe coronavirus restrictions are encroaching on their civil liberties. Djokovic's situation has also highlighted the plight of asylum seekers in Australia -- with dozens of refugees inside the same hotel as Djokovic who have been locked up for years, and who face indefinite detention under Australia's tough immigration rules.The arguments The arguments for both the defense and the government essentially centered around guidelines issued from an advisory group for the federal government called the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (ATAGI). Nick Wood, Senior Counsel representing Djokovic, argued ATAGI advice states that past Covid infection provides at least six months of natural protection -- ""and therefore may be regarded as a temporary exemption to vaccination.""He said Djokovic understood he'd been given approval to come to Australia by the government, and had made repeated appeals to federal officers in Melbourne that ""he had done absolutely everything that he understood was required for him to enter Australia.""""Any reasonable person would understand, and he did understand, that he had ticked absolutely every box,"" Wood added.Novak Djokovic of Serbia plays a backhand shot during a Davis Cup match at OlympiaWorld on November 27, 2021 in Innsbruck, Austria.Lawyers for Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Karen Andrews, defended the Australian Border Force decision to deport Djokovic, arguing the tennis star did not provide any medical reason why he could not be vaccinated against Covid-19. The government said Djokovic was mistaken to think he was guaranteed entry, and that a previous Covid infection does not equate to a valid medical reason why he could not be vaccinated.They pointed to the same ATAGI guidelines, which say despite acknowledgment of natural protection, past infection ""is not a contraindication to vaccination"" -- meaning it is not a valid reason for somebody not to get the vaccine.The government also argued that while those guidelines suggest people can temporarily put off their vaccination after acute illness, ""there was no suggestion Djokovic was seriously ill.""""All he has said is that he tested positive for Covid-19. That is not the same,"" the government said in its court submission. Police personnel watch pro-refugee protestors rally outside the Park Hotel, where Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic is believed to be held, in Melbourne, Australia, January 10.Tran, the government's barrister, said authorities have a low bar to canceling visas and that even the possibility of a risk to Australians' health was reason enough. Justice Anthony Kelly, however, appeared to acknowledge Djokovic's position, saying he was ""agitated"" by the burden placed on the tennis star to provide officials with evidence.Djokovic had recorded a Covid-19 infection in December -- which two independent panels agreed to be a good enough reason to delay Djokovic's need to be vaccinated.""What more could this man have done?"" Judge Kelly said. What Djokovic is playing for at the Australian OpenThe visa debacle had threatened Djokovic's chances of winning a record 21st grand slam at the Australian Open, which kicks off in Melbourne on January 17. Djokovic currently holds 20 grand slam singles victories, equaling the all-time record with Spain's Rafael Nadal and Switzerland's Roger Federer. A victory in Melbourne would mean Djokovic breaks the record for the most career grand slams ever held by a man. That is a very real possibility -- Djokovic has won the Australian Open nine times before. Federer, 40, is not playing in Melbourne and while Nadal, 35, is set to play, he has been beset with injury. The pair have faced each other 58 times, with Djokovic leading with 30 wins to 28. Nadal, who has won one Australian Open in 2009, is ranked world No. 6.

Court documents published on Saturday by Australia's Federal Circuit show that Djokovic was granted a medical exemption to compete after testing positive Covid-19 in December. His lawyers are appealing the visa cancellation and did not wish to comment ahead of his court hearing Monday.People hold placards outside the Park Hotel where 20-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic is staying in Melbourne on January 7, 2022.Djokovic case has gone far beyond an individual visa issue. It's prompted anger from people who feel the rich and powerful are getting an easy ride when it comes to Australia's tough Covid-19 rules, which have seen families separated for years -- but it's also angered anti-vaxxers who believe coronavirus restrictions are encroaching on their civil liberties. And it's prompted concerns from Australia's Serbian community, some of whom say Djokovic is being unfairly targeted.But Djokovic's situation has also highlighted the plight of asylum seekers in Australia. While the tennis star will ultimately either be allowed to play in the tournament or forced to leave the country, other detainees in the same facility have been locked up for years -- and face indefinite detention under Australia's tough immigration rules. Widespread outrageAs dozens of protesters from disparate groups of the political spectrum gathered outside the Park Hotel on Friday, there was one thing that united them: the push for freedom.Some were from Serbian cultural groups, singing and waving the Balkan country's flag, who saw Djokovic's detention as a great injustice against one of the world's biggest sports stars.""I don't see why he should be stuck in a detention center,"" said Tara, a 17-year-old Australian-Serb and junior tennis player, who did not give a last name.

But others focused their attention on the approximately 30 refugees held in the hotel. Authorities detain another top-flight tennis player over visa issues ahead of Australian Open Previously used by the Australian government as a Covid-19 quarantine facility, the hotel has been an Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) for refugees and asylum seekers for at least a year. Nearly a decade ago, Australia said no asylum seekers who arrived by boat would ever be settled in the country. Hundreds were housed at offshore processing centers for years, although some were sent to hotels in Australia to be treated for health conditions. The refugees still have little hope of freedom, and the conditions they are held in is hugely controversial. Standing in front of the Park Hotel, which is tagged with the words ""free them,"" Tom Hardman, a 27-year-old teacher, said he had come out in support of the refugees.""I'm here because the loneliness and the heartache these men suffer from not knowing when they will be released is unbearable to witness,"" he said. Police stand guard at the government detention center.Oscar Sterner, 25, said he was opposed to both anti-vaxxers and the way refugees were kept in detention -- and said the real problem was putting an unvaccinated visitor in a hotel with refugees who required medical attention. ""Djokovic is a millionaire scumbag who has rightly incurred the anger of a lot of people in Australia,"" he said. ""He can't be bothered to get vaccinated to protect the people around him.""What it's like insideDjokovic's supporters have hit out at his treatment, with the tennis star's mother saying her son is being ""treated like a prisoner."" ""It's so dirty and the food is so terrible,"" Dijana Djokovic told reporters Thursday at a news conference in Serbia's capital, Belgrade. ""It's just not fair. It's not human.""American tennis star John Isner also tweeted in support of Djokovic, saying keeping him in the hotel was ""not right.""""There's no justification for the treatment he's receiving. He followed the rules, was allowed to enter Australia, and now he's being detained against his own will.

""It is the individual traveler's responsibility to make sure that they have in place all the necessary documentation that is needed to enter Australia.""Australian immigration laws allow for an up to three year re-entry ban into the country following a visa cancellation under certain conditions -- but it is unclear if Djokovic will face such a penalty.In a statement Friday, the Professional Tennis Players Association said Djokovic had verified his well-being.""With the utmost respect for all personal views on vaccinations, vaccinated athletes and unvaccinated athletes (with an approved medical exemption) should both be afforded the freedom to compete,"" said the association, which was co-founded by Djokovic. ""We will continue to support and advocate for our members, and all players, in a manner that is acceptable to them.""Australia vowed to never let these men settle on its soil. Some just got visasAccording to human rights lawyer Alison Battisson, who has four clients inside the Park Hotel, visitors without the correct visa for Australia are normally handcuffed and transported to an immigration detention center in an unmarked van with blacked-out windows. ""It is an incredibly traumatic and dehumanizing process,"" she said. Video of the Park Hotel shared with CNN shows detainees in small rooms that include a double bed, a TV and some chairs. Asylum seekers have access to a stairway that leads them to a rooftop where they are able to smoke. It's unclear whether Djokovic is staying in the same conditions. ""This is a window, we can't open it at any stage,"" said Adnan Choopani, one of the detainees, in a video filmed for CNN. While the hotel appears clean and well-kept in footage filmed by Choopani, there have been reports of issues in the past. According to Battison, there was a Covid outbreak in the facility last year, and detainees have reported finding maggots in their food.The other detaineesFor the 30 or so refugees held in the hotel, the media spotlight on Djokovic is difficult to swallow. Many have been detained for years -- and have little hope of ever getting out.Mehdi, who asked to only use one name to protect his family, escaped from Iran when he was 15 years old and has been held in Australian detention for more than eight years with limited access to education or health care. ""I've served my time,"" said Mehdi, who turned 24 on Friday. ""We are suffering, we are exhausted and we are tired ... you are in indefinite detention, which means they can keep you as long as they can, as long as they want.""Cousins Adnan Choopani and Mehdi were 15 when they fled Iran. Now, they're 24 and still in immigration detention.Choopani said he and his fellow detainees were just sitting in their rooms, with many of them taking medication for depression. Choopani is Mehdi's cousin, and he left Iran when he was also 15. He dreams of taking a walk on a street or going out for a coffee. ""It's unbelievable,"" he said. ""I think this is just a nightmare ... we live in the 21st century, in a country who believes in democracy still doing this kind of behavior to innocent people.""Although it's unclear whether Djokovic will be allowed to play at Melbourne Park this month, the tennis star will eventually be let out of the hotel.Craig Foster, a former Australia national team footballer who advocates on behalf of the asylum seekers, says he hopes at least some good can come from the situation.""In one way, it's good for the world to see how Australia has been treating our entrants, whether they're asylum seekers or refugees, or indeed an athlete like Novak who has simply fallen afoul, apparently, on the documentation on his visa,"" he said. ""If anything, we're hoping that this entire embarrassing saga comes to place Australians in a position where they understand more the plight of these people."""

However, according to The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Border Force contacted the state Victoria government after learning of an issue with the visa submitted by Djokovic's team while the Serb was on his way to Australia. The 20-time grand slam champion reportedly traveled to Australia on a visa that does not permit medical exemptions for being unvaccinated, Australian news outlets reported. Acting Victoria Sports Minister Jaala Pulford confirmed in a tweet on Wednesday that the government would not support Djokovic's visa application. Read More""The Federal Government has asked if we will support Novak Djokovic's visa application to enter Australia. We will not be providing Novak Djokovic with individual visa application support to participate in the 2022 Australian Open Grand Slam,"" wrote Pulford.""We've always been clear on two points: visa approvals are a matter for the Federal Government, and medical exemptions are a matter for doctors,"" she added.Australian news outlets reported that the Australian Border Force subsequently sought support from the Victorian government to facilitate Djokovic's entry because Victoria partners with Tennis Australia in running the Australian Open.Both The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Djokovic would likely be allowed off the plane and into Melbourne, but the situation was still ongoing at midnight local time.Neither Tennis Australia nor Djokovic's team was immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN.Djokovic's coach, Goran Ivanisevic, posted a photo to social media from what appears to be the Melbourne Airport, where the men's tennis world No. 1 is reportedly being held due to the visa mix-up.Ivanisevic posted the photo of him and others with the caption, ""Not the most usual trip Down Under,"" on Instagram on Wednesday.

Australians have responded with anger and skepticism to the news that men's tennis No. 1 has been granted an exemption to compete.There had been uncertainty over Djokovic's participation after players were told they would have to be fully vaccinated in order to participate or have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts. The exemption from the vaccine mandate means he will defend his 2021 title in Melbourne.Djokovic, who is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on 20 grand slam singles titles, has not publicly revealed his vaccination status but voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates in April 2020.""Personally, I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,"" he said in a Facebook live chat, according to Reuters.But in May of last year, Djokovic said vaccination was a matter of personal choice: ""I will keep the decision as to whether I'm going to get vaccinated or not to myself.

Across Melbourne, one of the world's most locked-down cities in 2021, tennis fans took to social media posting calls for an Australian Open ""boycott."" The CEO of Tennis Australia, Craig Tiley, defended the impartiality of the medical exemption review process on Wednesday, telling reporters during a press conference that ""no one knew who the applicant was.""""There were 26 applicants through the process -- there's a handful which were provided with an exemption and that information only gets disclosed by those individuals on the grounds of which they were provided an exemption,"" Tiley said.""The process has been very clear and we completely understand and empathize with, first of all, some people being upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements in the past around vaccination,"" he said.Australian Open organizers confirm medical exemption process""However, it's ultimately up to him to discuss with the public his condition if he chooses to do that and the reason why he received his exemption.""Acting Victorian Sports Minister Jaala Pulford told reporters ""nobody has had special treatment.""""The process is incredibly robust. It's de-identified and we are where we are, and so the tennis can begin,"" she said, according to Reuters. Djokovic's exemption comes two weeks after Russian tennis player Nata Vikhlyantseva revealed she would be unable to travel to the tournament because her vaccine is not recognized by local health authorities.The Sputnik V is not on the list of vaccines currently approved by the Australian government, leaving world No.195 Vikhlyantseva ineligible to play.JUST WATCHEDNovak Djokovic is the no. 1 of number onesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNovak Djokovic is the no. 1 of number ones 03:44Under the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's (ATAGI) current guidelines, a medical exemption is granted to individuals who have an ""acute major medical condition (e.g. undergoing major surgery or hospital admission for a serious illness.""

I think it will help his cause,"" Becker told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.""Whether you like him or not, you need to respect his achievements.""When asked about how players will respond to Djokovic's exemption, Becker added: ""The difference will be nothing from before because he's been beating most of these players he's been seeing in the locker room, so he's not the most popular guy but for various different reasons.""The Australian Open is the first grand slam of the year and is set to run from January 17-30.CNN's Ben Church contributed reporting.

He was knocked out at Roland Garros in the French Open semi-finals and was forced to pull out of Wimbledon, the Tokyo Olympics and the U.S. Open.The positive COVID-19 test cast further doubt on whether the Spaniard would play at the Australian Open -- a tournament where he has won once and been runner-up four times.Rafael Nadal missed Wimbledon, the US Open and the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.Read MoreNadal will be expected to kick off his preparations for the Grand Slam by returning to the tour for the first time since August at the ATP 250 event in Melbourne from Tuesday.His arrival will be a boost for the organisers of the Australian Open, which has been ravaged by injuries with Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Dominic Thiem, Serena Williams and Bianca Andreescu all missing.While Nadal ended the speculation surrounding his participation, local media in Australia reported that Venus Williams has joined sister Serena in skipping the hardcourt Grand Slam.Seven-time major winner Venus would have required a wild card into the main draw but has decided against travelling to Melbourne, according to News Corp.There was still uncertainty if Serbia's world number one Novak Djokovic will play at the Australian Open, where the 34-year-old has won a record nine titles including the last three.Speculation over Djokovic's participation was heightened after he pulled out of the Serbia team for the ATP Cup in Sydney which starts on Saturday.

The entrepreneur and co-founder of Reddit was in London and his friend wanted him to come to Paris, ""He's like, you're an idiot if you don't come down to watch the USA play France.""Shortly afterwards, Ohanian was alongside 45,000 other fans, watching Megan Rapinoe score twice for the US women's national team in the quarterfinal of the Women's World Cup, leading her country towards what would be a fourth world title.  ""It was admittedly the first time I'd ever been to a women's football match,"" he told CNN Sport, ""and the crowd was electric. I walked away from it thinking, how did I not pay this enough attention? How did I not even know there was a pro league back in the States?"" A few days later, he and his wife, the tennis legend Serena Williams, were watching the tournament final on television. Their young daughter Olympia was running around wearing the jersey of one of the team's star players, Alex Morgan.Out loud, Ohanian wondered about the possibility of Olympia one day playing the game professionally, but Serena cut him off.Read More""Without missing a beat, my wife was like, not until they pay her what she's worth. And she was half joking, but not really.""In that moment, Ohanian says he felt compelled to try and make a positive contribution to the world of women's sports, ""Alright babe,"" he declared, ""challenge accepted!""

Ohanian is a lead investor on a new Los Angeles soccer project led by the Hollywood actress and activist Natalie Portman.The National Women's Soccer League was formed in 2013 with just five teams, four have been added since and the league will hit double figures in 2021 when Racing Louisville FC join in. The following season, Angel City will make it 11 teams in the league. According to Angel City's President Julie Uhrman, the idea for this new team came during Portman's involvement with Time's Up, a movement established in 2018 to combat sexual harassment.  ""You can see that she really gets behind causes that are important to her and she does meaningful work for those causes,"" Uhrman told CNN Sport, adding: ""she wanted to take her commitment to elevate women's athletics, to address pay equity and to make it public and meaningful.""  Promoting Angel City's launch in July, Portman spoke about the challenges which have traditionally held back women's sports. She was talking on Instagram with somebody who's experienced it first hand for the last 20 years -- Williams.  ""Our team told me that only 4% of sports coverage is of women's sport,"" Portman said, ""it's insane that we're here in 2020 and it's so disproportionate.""

READ: Alexis Ohanian on being married to Serena WilliamsSwimming against the tideThe team, which doesn't have an official name yet -- Angel City is only a nickname -- and they won't play until 2022. But already it's clear that those behind the club are doing things differently.For one, the founding investors are almost exclusively women, ""I think you can count the number of clubs that are mainly owned by women on one hand and probably with only a couple of fingers,"" Uhrman told CNN, ""I mean, it's very unusual."" Listed on the club's website are the 31 founding investors and only four are men; Alexis Ohanian is one of those odd-men out.He described an early meeting with Uhrman, Portman and venture capitalist Kara Nortman, ""the three of them sat down and said, 'this is what we want to build, this is how we want to build it,' and it was really important to them from day one to have a majority women-owned team. ""I think we can talk about so many of the disparities in professional sports. And I think one of the ways we get real change is not just proving that this is an amazing business that will generate lots of money and lots of attention and lots of success, but it's also showing that every bit of how this organization is run can be different and be as, if not more successful as a result.""And not because it feels good, although it does feel good, but because it's preposterous that it is not more normal."" The club knows that they are trying to swim against the tide, and not just because they're hoping to change the perception of professional women's sport; they're also launching a club in a Los Angeles sports market that is already saturated. US-Israeli actress Natalie Portman arrives for the 92nd Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California on February 9, 2020.READ: Natalie Portman and Serena Williams are among investors behind Angel CityCrowded marketUhrman rattles off the clubs that they'll soon be rubbing shoulders with in a city famed for congestion, ""Los Angeles is a market where there is already nine professional sports teams and [collegiate] powerhouses like University of Southern California and University of California, Los Angeles.So even the idea of bringing another professional sports team here, the third soccer club here, is an ambitious, big idea."" But Angel City believes that their novel approach will cut through the noise, establishing a local, community, club with global appeal. ""We know women's soccer has been incredibly successful during the Olympics and World Cup,"" Uhrman says,""The question is, why is it every four years that they garner such attention? And I think the answer is because of exposure and awareness."" Behind the key investors is a supporting cast of Hollywood stars, including Jennifer Garner, Eva Longoria and Jessica Chastain, plus Serena Williams and 14 former players on the US women's national team; it's a group of women with tens of millions of followers on social media; they're going to use their collective platforms to shout it from the rooftops.  ""There's this general issue that if you can't see it,"" Uhrman says, ""You can't be it. If you can't see it, you can't follow it. [If] you can't cheer for it, you can't get your friend to become a part of it, and so there's a systemic problem that we have to fix and change."" Founder of OUYA Julie Uhrman speaks onstage at the Julie Uhrman + Josh Topolsky Keynote during the 2013 SXSW Music, Film + Interactive Festival at Austin Convention Center on March 11, 2013 in Austin, Texas.Uhrman continues, ""We have a group of people that come from the entertainment space, the media space, sports and the technology space. We're thinking about soccer as bigger than sports, in fact we're thinking about it as entertainment."" Ohanian says the focus will be on social media storytelling to build the brand and it already seems to be working, ""tens of thousands of folks are very excited, [we've] sold out merchandise for a team that doesn't exist yet."" He compares women's soccer to e-sports, which drew a rush of investment five years ago, and has concluded that the market has massively undervalued female soccer.""These are clubs of gamers, young men who draw hundreds of millions of fans all over the world. [But] the average American does not know who the best League of Legends player is, whereas Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan are already cultural icons.""From a marketing standpoint, no offense to e-sports, they're far more marketable for brands who want to be aligned with consumer spending in this country."" In her conversation with Williams on Instagram, Portman remarked that already, Angel City has changed the conversation, ""people are starting to think about how to do this in other sports too.""  Women are standing up for and elevating other women; the sisters are doing it for themselves. It's an LA Story that could have a Hollywood ending and it's a potential game-changer for women's sports everywhere."

The callers were scouts, inquiring as to whether Mason Greenwood, the six-year-old who would develop into Manchester United's prodigiously talented striker, would be featuring the next day for the boys' team Newsham coached in the north of England, Idle FC. Greenwood has, clearly, always made an impression on the pitch.How Bruno Fernandes transformed Manchester United's fortunesSince those carefree days as a lightning quick striker playing near his hometown of Bradford, the 18-year-old has become an integral member of an improving United, scoring goals, helping the team rise up the league and, over the last month, talked about as the next great English talent.

Scoring 10 league goals in an impressive debut season, Greenwood is only the third teenager to score 10 or more English Premier League goals in a single campaign.Former England captain Alan Shearer has said Greenwood could usurp him as the EPL's record scorer. According to former Liverpool player and now football pundit Jamie Redknapp, those at United who have worked with the teenager say he's one of the best the club has ever seen, while another former England star, Gary Lineker, has said it ""won't be long"" until Greenwood is selected by England manager Gareth Southgate. The list of admirers seems endless. But those who follow United closely have known about a young player called Greenwood coming through the ranks for years. Hyperbole and excitement has followed the player from a young age.'A different level to everyone else'As a six-year-old playing for Idle FC's under-7s, it was the young Greenwood's pace that stood out, recalls Newsham. Shy and small in stature, Greenwood also had an eye for goal, shooting on sight, just as he did for United post-lockdown as the team secured a lucrative Champions League spot by finishing third in the league.  A few days after his sixth birthday, Greenwood made his debut for Idle FC in a match against Silsden Football and Cricket Club, scoring all 10 goals in a 10-1 win. ""I kept having to bring him off because once you had 10 goals you had to stop the game, so I had to bring him off otherwise the game would've been over too quick,"" recalls Newsham with a chuckle. ""I'd keep bringing him off and he'd just stick by the side of my leg, looking up at me asking, 'Can I go on again yet, Paul?' He was so happy to be playing.""From the first training session, his control of the ball at that sort of age was excellent. You could tell watching him he was a totally different level to everyone else.""Greenwood (2R) celebrates scoring his team's second goal  against Aston Villa on July 9, 2020. Greenwood's scoring ability is a natural talent honed to such an extent that Solskjaer, a man who worked with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, has described him as the deadliest finisher he has seen at such an age. He is only the fourth teenager in United's history, following George Best, Brian Kidd and Rooney, to score 17 goals or more in a season. It was at Idle's annual invitational tournament, involving youth teams in the local area, that Greenwood was set on a path that would lead to Old Trafford. Having impressed onlooking scouts, including United's, shortly after the tournament he started training at United's development centre in Halifax, Yorkshire, eventually signing for the club aged nine. ""I did speak to some scouts at that tournament, I'm sure I spoke to a Man Utd scout but I don't recollect it because there were that many coming up to me then asking about him,"" adds Newsham.""Once he went to Manchester United when he was seven, he couldn't play for us. His dad rung me to say he wasn't allowed to play anymore. I was gutted, but when you go to train with a club like that you can understand why they don't want to play local football.""Flourishing under SolskjaerGreenwood's rise has been rapid, but of no surprise to his former coach. Aged 14, United gave him a scholarship. Two years later, he was topping the scoring charts in the Under-18s Premier League (north) and being named player of the tournament at the 2018 International Cor Groenewegen Tournament. He also excelled at age group level for England, helping England's Under-18s win the four-team Limoges tournament. Greenwood in action during the international friendly between England U15 and Turkey U15 at St George's Park on December 21, 2015 in Burton-upon-Trent, England.It was under Jose Mourinho that Greenwood made his senior debut for United, against Club America in Phoenix on a pre-season tour in the summer of 2018, but it is under Solskjaer that he has blossomed, particularly excelling once the EPL resumed in June following a 100-day pause because of the coronavirus pandemic. He is now established in the first team, scoring five times in the last eight games of the season, and returned from lockdown with a noticeably more muscular frame than the teenager who started the season on the substitutes' bench. ""That's sometimes something you see with young players, that initially you see them and there's evidence of talent, but then there's a point where they develop that extra, whether it's upper body muscle or that edge of pace, to take them away from someone,"" British sports journalist Richard Jolly tells CNN Sport. ""I guess we'll never know what would have happened without the lockdown, but he does seem to have come back from it stronger and looking ready to play every week.""What sets Greenwood apart from most other players is that he is two-footed, a rare skill acquired thanks to his father who would encourage him to practice with both feet. Twenty minutes before the start of training at United's Halifax center, Greenwood would be shooting with both feet at the bins outside the door, so the story goes. His family, who have shied away from media attention, as has the teenager himself, have been key to his rise, with his father taking him to Moss Side, a relatively deprived area of the city, to play five-a-side football to toughen him up.Greenwood celebrates scoring against Bournemouth at Old Trafford on July 4, 2020.Poised in front of goal, he plays as if time slows when he has the ball and has already proven he can score from all sorts of angles and distances. ""He's genuinely two-footed with his finishing, he scores a good number of goals from outside the box as well as inside,"" adds Jolly. ""For those who believe in expected goals, Greenwood over-performs his expected goals to a huge extent, showing what a good finisher he is. He's not missing chances at all.""Everyone at United probably knows he's here to stay. He is one for the long term and he's much like [Marcus] Rashford, he's one of those who saved them 50 or 100 million pounds.""'Massively exciting'There needs to be some perspective, of course. At the same age, World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe was starring in the Champions League and breaking Thierry's Henry Ligue 1 scoring record. Yet, there is no denying that Greenwood is a wondrous talent. Football is a brutal business and Greenwood has already beaten the odds by making it this far -- according to Michael Calvin in his book ""No Hunger in Paradise"" only 180 of the 1.5 million boys who play organized youth football in England will become a Premier League professional. But throughout his young life, Greenwood has set himself apart from the rest. Kylian Mbappe: The 'phenomenon that breathes and sleeps football'""With Mason Greenwood, we're actually looking at a player that can be anything he wants to be,"" Mark Goldbridge, presenter for United Stand, tells CNN Sport. ""People are talking about him being up there with the likes of Neymar, Mbappe and Messi. I think that's unfair. But at 18 years of age, I remember Wayne Rooney and there are parallels in different ways, in that he's got a talent that senior, experienced Premier League clubs are struggling to shut him down when he's in full flow off both feet.""We're really, really excited about what he's going to become at Manchester United.""The praise directed at Greenwood these last few weeks has been lavish. Should he continue on an upward trajectory, he may have to become accustomed to it. Additional reporting by CNN's Ben Church "

The success enjoyed under legendary manager Alex Ferguson feels like a distant memory for a global fan base that has watched its once great club lurch from one bad decision to another. An FA Cup win in 2016 under Louis van Gaal and Europa League glory under Jose Mourinho in 2017 were two of the highlights in what's been an uninspiring period since Ferguson retired in 2013 -- and a far cry from the 38 trophies won by Scot in his 26 years at the club. The future didn't look much brighter back in January. The club, now managed by former player Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, found itself fifth in the league table by New Year.The football was poor, the atmosphere was toxic and star man Paul Pogba, once seen as the saving grace, looked set to leave as soon as he could. Read MoreWhat I learned from watching 92 games of Premier League football in a rowBut, fast forward seven months, and there are now signs of new life under Solskjaer, most notably since the arrival of one Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese playmaker turned up at Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon in January and was thrown into a team lacking creativity, quality and leadership. Fortunately for his new employees, it seems Fernandes has all three of those attributes in abundance.  Since his debut at the start of the year, United had not lost a game in the league, rising up the table to finish third and qualify for next season's UEFA Champion League for the first time since the 2018-19 season. It was a remarkable feat considering the club started the campaign by making its worst start to a league season in 33 years. What's more, Fernandes brought excitement back to the red half of Manchester after years of uninspiring, and often woeful, performances. His eight league goals and seven assists demonstrate the sort of player United now has on its hands. ""He [Fernandes] told me about the league, how intense it is to play in that league,"" Porto star Danilo Pereira told CNN Sport. ""It's not a surprise for me to see the impact he's had in Manchester. I think United can return to their golden years with him and Pogba and other players.""READ: Rashford to be awarded honorary doctorate for forcing government U-turnBruno Fernandes had an instant impact on Manchester United. 'A really, really good signing'If such a thing as a typical Manchester United player exists, Fernandes would surely be it. A risk-taker, exciting to watch and able to cope with the extreme pressures of playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world, the attacking midfielder has become an instant hit.He's been a leader from day one; stepping up to take (and score) six penalties during his short spell at the club -- including the pivotal spot-kick against Leicester City which helped United on its way to Champions League football next season. Ex-players and pundits alike have fawned over his performances since he moved to England, where he's won the Man of the Match award in almost every game he's played. ""You can see that he's got the talent and he's not scared. He wants the ball, which I would expect from a very good player,"" former Premier League star and current Monaco player Cesc Fabregas told CNN Sport. ""But what I like is that he's intelligent in terms of moving around the pitch. He knows when to get between the lines. He knows when to go in the space when he sees that someone is available to make a chip. He arrives at the second line fantastically. ""He supports the midfield when they are building up and struggle a little bit, and when teams are putting a lot of pressure on them. ""He can play long, he can play short, little passes. He has the personality to take free-kicks and penalties. He's not scared. He doesn't hide. I think Man United made a really good choice. A really good signing.""READ: Meet the Manchester United fanatic opening a 33,000-piece museum in FinlandThe playmaker helped fire the club into next season's UEFA Champions League. Instant impactAdapting to the Premier League is no simple feat. It usually takes players time to get used to the physicality and fast paced nature of the league, but it hasn't been a stumbling block for Fernandes.Although his performances in Portugal gave an indication of what was to come, such an instant impact took many by surprise. ""You looked at the player at Sporting Lisbon and clearly he was someone who scored a lot of goals and someone who created a lot of goals, but there's always a challenge as to whether they can translate that to a better league and into a new club,"" British journalist Richard Jolly told CNN Sport, adding that he saw no realistic way of United finishing in the top four without Fernandes.  ""But he's been a transformative player and a revelation in terms of how quickly he's done it, I mean it really was from day one.""You look at both the goal tallies and the assist tallies, and they're fantastic. If you could maintain that form over the entire season, that's an incredible player there."" JUST WATCHEDBlack footballers too 'scared' to look at social media due to racist abuse, says ZahaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBlack footballers too 'scared' to look at social media due to racist abuse, says Zaha 03:33Pogba improvement Whilst his individual brilliance is evident, Fernandes' arrival has seen the uptick in the form of players around him. The attacking trio of Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford scored at will after football returned from lockdown (the team has scored 22 goals in its last nine league games), and the likes of Pogba and Nemanja Matic have looked more settled in the midfield. Pogba, in particular, is a different player to one who was seemingly weighed down by the pressure of being the biggest star in the starting lineup.The Frenchman's relationship with the club appeared to reach rock bottom earlier this season, with constant rumors linking the midfielder with a move away from the club. Fans also grew frustrated with Pogba for spending much of the season on the treatment table after suffering two ankle injuries. When they did catch a glimpse of him on the field, he often underwhelmed.  But now, since he returned from his latest injury after lockdown, there have been early signs that a partnership with Fernandes could flourish and the World Cup winner suddenly looks more comfortable. ""I think Pogba likes to be surrounded by big players and big characters in their own right, I don't think he wants to be the only big name there, and thus have all the pressure lumped on him,"" Jolly said.""I think he probably doesn't want to be in a midfield where he's surrounded by mediocrities. I think you've seen signs already of a bit of chemistry between Pogba and Fernandes which helps, but I think he also just appreciates the element that he's playing with other quality players around him."" Paul Pogba has vastly improved since Fernandes joined. The new Cantona? Fernandes had been linked to a move to Old Trafford throughout 2019 and there had been disappointment when the deal wasn't completed in time for the new season. So, when the transfer got over the line in January for an initial $61 million (£47m), fans were ready to see what all the fuss was about. It's safe to say they haven't been disappointed. Mark Goldbridge, a United supporter and presenter of fan channel The United Stand, cannot wait to see how the team develops. ""I sort of liken it to what Eric Cantona did when he came to Manchester United from Leeds [in 1992] and we won our first Premier League title,"" he said. ""It was sort of the kick-start for some real success.""Now, I'm not saying Bruno Fernandes is going to lead Manchester United to the same level of success that Cantona did but he's not just one player coming in and making us great. ""It's one player that's come in and made everybody else around him better."" It's easy to forget that Fernandes has only been at the club for a matter of months but he's already established himself as a firm fan favorite -- with one particular moment, in a game against local rivals Manchester City, a defining one of his short time at the club. Fernandes got involved with a sideline feud with Pep Guardiola, resulting in the Portuguese player putting his finger to his lips and shushing the City manager. ""I think Bruno, in a very short period of time, has certainly come in and really grasped what Manchester United is all about,"" said Goldbridge.""Ultimately, there's a thin line between grasping what Manchester United is all about and actually just being somebody who loves the game, wants to play the game in the right way, and is passionate to win.""I remember his little argument with Pep when we played Man City, and the fans loved that because I think Fernandes just wants to win."" READ: Rashford, the gifted Manchester United star who became a remarkable activistFernandes has provided United's front three with more chances. Another false dawn?Whilst United's form dropped for the final two games of the season, fans will be holding on to those encouraging signs of life and hoping this isn't yet another false dawn at the club. The third-place finish, although not befitting of the club's true ambition, must be seen as progress and attention can now turn to winning the Europa League, which is set to resume on August 5.  United face a simple task in their second-leg tie against LASK on Wednesday, leading 5-0 from the first leg and all but guaranteed a place in the quarterfinals. Although winning European football's secondary club cup competition is nothing to be smirked at, the real prize is still the Premier League. Despite all the improvements seen at the club in recent weeks, the gulf between it and the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City remains wide -- it finished 33 points behind eventual champion Liverpool this season. A productive summer in the transfer market could be just what United needs, and Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho is just one of the names being linked with a switch to Old Trafford.There had been signs of success during both Van Gaal and Mourinho's time at the club but something does feel different about United under Solskjaer.Maybe a return to its glory days aren't too far away. ""It does look more sustainable and one of the things that they're doing is they're not just beating teams but, if you look at that winning run, they've won quite a lot of those games comfortably and quite emphatically, and, quite entertainingly,"" said Jolly. ""I think what you might see next year is not necessarily United winning the league but them getting in the top four a lot more comfortably."""

Inspired by the spelbinding performances of Pelé -- he wore the number 10 jersey  -- the yellow shirt has represented Brazil's success on the pitch and created a positive image worldwide for the past five decades.That 1970 national team also became embroiled in politics, notably ahead of the World Cup in Mexico when General Medici, the president of a nation under military dictatorship, played a key role in the removal of the coach -- Joao Saldanha -- who had overseen a perfect qualification campaign.Fast forward to 2020 and critics of Bolsonaro say the iconic yellow jersey has now become tainted by its close association to the Brazilian president.  President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro celebrates with the trophy and the players of Brazil after winning the Copa America final against Peru.Walter Casagrande, a former footballer for the Brazilian national team and the São Paulo club Corinthians, remembers the feeling of scoring a goal while wearing the yellow jersey in his first match with the ""selecao"" in 1985.Read More""It was a magical thing,"" Casagrande told CNN Sport, ""like an enchanted object that gave me huge emotion.""

Casagrande said that for him the power of the yellow shirt used to be that it represented democracy and freedom.""Brazil is appearing horribly to the world right now,"" he said. ""It's the first time in my life I'm seeing the yellow jersey being used against democracy and freedom.""

As a Bolsonaro supporter, Alexandre brushes off accusations that the jersey's symbolism is being manipulated, and says the reason for supporters to wear a yellow t-shirt is simple: everyone in Brazil has a yellow t-shirt.He points out that supporters don't always wear the Brazilian team jersey specifically, and rallies are full of people wearing yellow t-shirts of all kinds.  Alexandre says there is a separation between the jersey's sporting reputation and associations from what it politically represents.""Around the world everybody knows about the Brazilian soccer team, so even if I go to a fight and I use the yellow soccer team shirt, everyone knows it's Brazil,"" he said. ""So it's not about politics -- it's just that the world knows about soccer in Brazil.""It may be easier for some than others to isolate football and politics in a country where football is God.Josemar de Rezende Jr. is a football fan who co-founded a Bolsonaro volunteer group in his city before the election.

""Not the changes that this government is doing,"" Assumpção clarified. On the other side of the political spectrum, the color yellow, including the yellow jersey, represents a positive change in the country. Bolsonaro supporter Rezende Jr. believes the attempt by the left to reclaim the yellow jersey is an effort to ""mischaracterize the government,"" which he describes as a ""patriotic government that represents and has support from all social classes throughout the nation.""Supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro demonstrate to show their support, in Brasilia, on May 31, 2020 during the COVID-19 novel coronavirus pandemic.READ: A pig's head and riot police: Football's most controversial transferRival football fans unitePolitical turmoil in the country mirrors the fierceness between inter-city football rivalries all across Brazil.

In the second half, the English side cranked up the pressure, and the pressure eventually told, as Kevin de Bruyne coolly slotted home to level the score before substitute Moussa Dembélé scored two goals to see Lyon through. Lyon will face Bayern Munich in the semifinal on Wednesday, after the German side advanced to the semifinals on Friday, dispatching Barcelona 8-2.

Manchester City dominated possession from the first whistle, but failed to create any golden opportunities. And eventually Lyon's ability to counterattack produced the game's first goal. A ball played behind the City defence for Karl Toko Ekambi to run on to eventually fell to Maxwel Cornet and, with City keeper Ederson out of his goal, Cornet threaded a magnificent curling shot into the near post from about 20 yards.The rest of the first half played out just as Lyon and manager Rudi Garcia would have planned. Manchester City dominated possession without creating too many clear-cut chances while Pep Guardiola's team looked susceptible on the break.After the half-time break, the game opened up and following an attacking substitution by Guardiola, City began to create chances at will. And eventually the pressure told, as some nice footwork by England international Raheem Sterling freed him up to lay it back for de Bruyne to finish. It looked like there would only be one winner. However, Lyon's own super-sub Dembélé thought differently, latching on to a through ball near half-way and finishing under Ederson. A nervy video assistant referee check followed but after a few minutes of waiting, the goal was given. Forward Maxwel Cornet celebrates scoring Lyon's first goal against Manchester City on Saturday, August 15.Although City was behind, it created the better chances and the best of which fell to Sterling. Some clever dribbling and a cross from Gabriel Jesus left Sterling with an open goal from just five yards out, but he sent ball skyward and over the goal. And the miss proved costly. Just 59 seconds later, Lyon had scored again, Dembélé pouncing on a poor save from Ederson to send the French club into the final four for the first time in nearly 10 years. The result means that during Guardiola's time at the club, Manchester City has failed to make it past the quarterfinal stage of the Champions League.Despite thinking that his side played well for the majority of the game, Guardiola lamented Manchester City's inability to play without errors in the Champions League.

Tensions in the Middle East have escalated in recent weeks, with Iran-backed Houthi militants launching unprecedented missile and drone attacks on the United Arab Emirates, considered a haven of security in the volatile region. Saudi-led coalition forces fighting the militant group retaliated with the deadliest offensive on Houthi-held parts of northern Yemen in years, killing scores of people and knocking out the country's internet. In his comments Wednesday, Le Drian warned that a breakdown in the Vienna talks would trigger a ""serious crisis."" ""Either [the Iranians] trigger a serious crisis in the days to come -- we could do without that -- or else they accept the agreement which respects the interests of all parties and particularly the interests of Iran,"" he said.  Le Drian said the two and half months of negotiations in Vienna was ""exhausting diplomatic work."" Iran returned to indirect negotiations with the US shortly after President Joe Biden -- who promised to return to the deal as a presidential nominee -- took office. Iran had rejected repeated overtures by the Trump administration to return to the negotiations after the former president withdrew from the deal. "

world,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/economy/russia-ukraine-economy-inflation/index.html,6 ways the Russia-Ukraine conflict could hurt your wallet,"By Matt Egan, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)The Russia-Ukraine crisis is taking place thousands of miles away from the closest major US city. And yet millions of American families would feel the economic consequences of a full-blown conflict.That's because the world economy and financial markets are interconnected. As Covid demonstrated, events on one side of the planet can set off shockwaves on the other side.Exclusive: Russia-Ukraine conflict could cause inflation to hit 10%, new analysis findsIn this case, an invasion of Ukraine by Russia would likely drive up the already-high cost of living in the United States, rattle investment portfolios and perhaps even slow down the economic recovery.""The average American household is going to bear the burden of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine,"" said RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. Hope remains for no invasion and that recent signs of de-escalation continue. If not, there are many ways American consumers could find themselves caught in the middle of this brewing conflict. Read MoreMore pain at the pumpOil prices have jumped in recent weeks to levels unseen since 2014 in part because an invasion of Ukraine could derail Russian energy supply.Russia is an energy superpower, producing 9.7 million barrels per day last year, according to Rystad Energy. That is second only to the United States and amounts to more oil than Iraq and Canada produced — combined.How a Russian invasion in Ukraine could disrupt life in AmericaSupply is already failing to keep up with demand and investors are on high alert for any further supply shortfalls that could occur through in a variety of ways, including damaged infrastructure in a war, sanctions on Russia or Moscow moving to weaponize exports.JPMorgan warned that if any Russian oil flows are disrupted by the crisis, oil prices could ""easily"" jump to $120 a barrel. In the unlikely event that Russian oil exports are halved, crude would surge to $150 a barrel, JPMorgan said. A dramatic spike in oil prices could be offset at least in part by consuming nations releasing emergency stockpiles and OPEC ramping up production.Still, another pop in oil prices would lift prices at the pump, which lag behind move in crude prices. The national average price for a gallon of gas already stands at a seven-year high of $3.50 a gallon, according to AAA. Oil prices retreated sharply on Tuesday on hopes that Russia and Ukraine will step back from the brink.Historic inflationInflation is the biggest problem facing the US economy. And the Russia-Ukraine crisis could make it even worse.Even if oil rallied to only $110 a barrel in an escalation of tensions, the year-over-year inflation rate would climb above 10%, according to an analysis by RSM shared with CNN. That's up from the current 7.5%.American inflation hasn't climbed to 10% since 1981.Not only would prices at the pump rise, but higher oil and natural gas prices would drive up home heating and electricity costs. 'People are unhappy': Fed official warns on high inflationHigher energy prices would make it more expensive to fly and keep transportation and input costs elevated for businesses already grappling with surging expenses. Businesses would most likely pass along at least some of these higher costs to consumers in the form of price spikes.Beyond energy, other commodities could experience price volatility. Russia is a major producer of metals, including aluminum and palladium. Russia is also the biggest exporter of wheat, while Ukraine is a significant exporter of both wheat and corn. ""All of this would occur at a time when commodity supplies are more stressed than they have been in a generation,"" David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, wrote in a report on Monday.Of course, inflationary pressures would likely be even greater for Europeans, given their proximity to the crisis and reliance on Russian energy.Market turbulenceInvestors have been glued to the latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Signs of escalation have spooked markets, while comments suggesting war might be averted have set off relief rallies. Investors famously detest uncertainty. It's easy to see how a full-blown invasion of Ukraine would trigger a knee-jerk selloff in stocks as investors confront the possibility of an oil shock, higher inflation and a confusing sanctions regime. A prolonged market downturn would wipe out wealth built up by families in the stock market and in retirement accounts. Market instability could also dent confidence among consumers and businesses alike. Stocks do have a history of rebounding from geopolitical scares, although there is a relatively small sample size. And it's impossible to say how markets would respond in the current environment. Slower economic growthA Russia-Ukraine conflict would threaten to slow down the US economy by worsening inflation and increasing uncertainty. The RSM analysis found that a jump to $110 oil would dent US GDP by one percentage point.That is not as dramatic as the impact to inflation, but it's still significant given that the US economy has not fully recovered all the jobs lost during Covid.Higher borrowing costsIf inflation spikes above 10%, the Federal Reserve would come under pressure to step up its fight to get prices under control. That could mean a faster pace of interest rate hikes to cool off inflation. The coming interest rate increases from the Fed will increase borrowing costs for consumers on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards. Mortgage rates have already spiked to pre-Covid levels in recent weeks, presenting a new challenge to wannabe home buyers. Wheat and corn prices could jump if Russia invades UkraineThe Fed could choose to shrug off intensifying inflation as just a temporary phenomenon driven by the Russia-Ukraine situation. However, that strategy did not work out well last year, with the Fed eventually abandoning its ""transitory"" description of Covid-related inflation.At a minimum, the Russia-Ukraine situation would further complicate the Fed's already difficult task of taming inflation without sparking a recession.Cyberattacks and moreUS President Joe Biden warned Tuesday of the potential for Russia to lash out in a conflict through the cyber realm. ""If Russia attacks the United States or allies through asymmetric means, like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we're prepared to respond,"" Biden said.Cyberattack hits websites of Ukraine defense ministry and armed forcesThe hacking of the Colonial Pipeline last year showed just how disruptive a cyberattack can be in the real world. The cyber intrusion shut down one of the most important pipelines in America, sparking panic buying that left many gas stations in the Southeast empty.A successful cyberattack on America's financial system — a top worry of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — could be even more disruptive.A cyberattack is just one example of how the Russia-Ukraine situation could spill over into daily life. ""Wars evolve in unpredictable ways,"" JPMorgan's Kelly said. ""No one should assume that they can see all the impacts of a war at its outset."""

That's an increase from the previous high of 21% who completed Dry January in 2019.Participants credited their commitment to a growing selection of non-alcoholic offerings and mocktails that made it ""easier to forego alcohol while not making social sacrifices,"" CGA said Wednesday. Those options were some of the most popular choices with about 30% of consumers drinking non-alcoholic beer (up from 5% in 2019) and 23% choosing mocktails (up from 7% in 2019.) Alcoholic-free wines and spirits also experienced a jump in popularity. ""Curiosity beyond a traditional mocktail indicates that there are more high-quality options available with compelling flavor profiles that can stand on their own,"" CGA said. The selection of new options is boosting bars and restaurants' bottom lines, adding $295 million in revenue industry-wide by attracting customers who may have otherwise shied away from going out.Read MoreAnd customers like what they're drinking. About 75% of those surveyed by CGA said they would continue drinking alcohol-free beer, spirits and mocktails, and 64% planned to stick with alcohol-free wine.""This is positive news for emerging brands in the non-alcoholic 'better for you' space and highlights the opportunity for suppliers to introduce non-alcoholic brand extensions that keep consumers engaged with their brand family,"" CGA said.Big brands have taken notice. A flurry of non-alcoholic options have appeared on shelves in recent years in response to the growing trend, from such brands as  Budweiser, Heineken and Guinness owner Diageo. ""Low- and no-alcohol variations have also been a key subcategory in recent years, linking into health trends. People want to make healthier choices, but they don't want to miss out on their favorite treats,"" wrote Elliott Maddison, beverage analyst at GlobalData, in a note Wednesday. ""Heineken's 0.0 brand, which experienced growth above 30%, has been reaping the benefits.""Although the sector is growing, however, it remains small.

Ironically, it is just the kind of juicy swindler story you might binge watch on those platforms: Horwitz, a 35-year-old actor who had bit roles in a handful of low-budget films over the past decade, pleaded guilty last fall to committing federal securities fraud and running an illegal operation known as a Ponzi scheme. For years, prosecutors say, Horwitz used his investors' money to fund a lavish Hollywood lifestyle — until his scam unraveled. Ponzi schemes, explainedIn short, a Ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud that uses money from new investors to pay off earlier ones. The term comes from the 1920 swindler Charles Ponzi, but in recent years has become synonymous with the crimes of Bernie Madoff, the mastermind behind the largest financial fraud in history, who died in prison last year. Read MoreAlthough Ponzi schemes have a long history, they are far from a bygone threat, experts say. In fact, they remain a major risk to investors in an era of soaring stock markets and wild surges in newfangled assets like NFTs and cryptocurrency.""Fraudsters really feed on times of uncertainty, financial distress, upheaval, times of change, and those are really the times that we've been living in the past few years,"" says Kathy Bazoian Phelps, a lawyer who runs a blog about Ponzi schemes. ""And of course there's a lot of money out there people are looking to invest.Horwitz's case appears to check the major boxes for a Ponzi scheme: They're typically perpetrated by (a) men who (b) promise steadily high returns with minimal risk and (c) often prey on friends and family to get the scam off the ground.  Early investors in a Ponzi scheme get rewarded with mindbogglingly large dividends — Horwitz allegedly promised returns between 25% and 45% — that propel them to tell others about the golden opportunity, which keeps new money flowing into the scam. Once the pool of new investment dries up, of course, the fraud falls apart. A fraud is bornProsecutors say Horwitz, who goes by the stage name Zach Avery, promised his investors — many of whom were friends — that their money would be used to buy film distribution rights that he would then license to streaming platforms for a profit. ""But, as his victims came to learn, [Horwitz] was not a successful businessman or Hollywood insider,"" prosecutors said. ""He just played one in real life."" (Savage burn, prosecutors.) Horwitz's company ""neither acquired film rights nor entered into any distribution agreements with HBO or Netflix"" and he provided fake documents to his investors. HBO, like CNN, is part of WarnerMedia.Horwitz instead routed the funds to his own accounts, shelling out $5.7 million on a house and splurging on trips to Vegas on private jets, according to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.It's not hard to imagine how an investor might be sucked into such a scam in the era of meme stock rallies and overnight cryptocurrency millionaires. The fear of missing out is a powerful tool for grifters.Phelps, who wrote ""The Ponzi Book: A Legal Resource for Unraveling Ponzi Schemes,"" says people often rely too much on word of mouth without due diligence to determine whether an investment is legitimate. That can be especially true when it comes to schemes involving cryptocurrencies or artificial intelligence. ""All it takes is for somebody to represent that they have the proprietary algorithm that guarantees returns and that sounds pretty technical and fancy and like a sure thing,"" she said. ""That feels comfortable to people because somebody knows technically what they're talking about, supposedly, and the outcome is a guaranteed return that's much higher than something they're going to find somewhere else.""In fact, the SEC is particularly worried that the rise of cryptos ""may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes"" in part by promising investors an opportunity to ""get in on the ground floor of a growing internet phenomenon."" The agency cited a 2013 case in which an alleged Ponzi scheme advertised a bitcoin ""investment opportunity"" in an online forum. Investors were promised up to 7% interest per week, and that their funds would be used for bitcoin arbitrage. Instead, the crypto funds were used to pay existing investors and exchanged into US dollars to pay the organizer's personal expenses.Even professional investors can fall victim to fraud, Phelps notes, but there are several ways to avoid getting taken for a ride. Step one is simply being mindful of the potential for fraud. ""I'm not even sure if that crosses people's minds at all,"" she said. Beyond that, investors need to ask due diligence questions, beware of promises of guaranteed return with no risk and watch out for returns that are higher than what you're likely to find in the marketplace. ""If you can't really understand what the investment is after a five-minute explanation,"" Phelps says, ""you probably shouldn't be investing in it."""
world,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/tech/uber-ratings-update/index.html,Uber now lets you see how many one-star ratings you received from drivers,By Jennifer Korn,"New York (CNN Business)Confused how you ended up with a low rating on Uber? A new feature will offer a bit more insight.Uber on Wednesday announced an option that lets you see a breakdown of how many drivers left you a one-star rating, a five-star rating and other ratings in between. Previously users of the ride share app were only able to see their average rating. Uber's business is over the pandemic slumpFinding the rating breakdown requires several steps. First, open the Settings menu of the app, tap Privacy and then Privacy Center. Once there, swipe to the right and click on the option: ""would you like to see a summary of how you use Uber."" Next, scroll to the ""browse your data"" section and tap on ""view my ratings."" (You can also access the information on Uber's website.)The goal of the new feature, according to Uber, is to offer customers a better understanding of their current rating, which is based on their most recent 500 trips on the platform, and to incentivize good behavior during rides.""We hope that by giving users a peek into how their rating is calculated, we can help encourage positive experiences between riders and drivers on every trip,"" said Zach Singleton, head of privacy and equity products at Uber (UBER). Read MoreUber said all identifying information is kept anonymous for safety reasons.Uber relies on a two-way rating system in an effort to hold passengers and drivers accountable during rides. Drivers and riders with lower ratings risk being deactivated from the platform. The threshold for being deactivated varies from city to city, as the company accounts for a variety of factors when determining the point of user termination.Uber revealed on Wednesday that the US city with the lowest average rider rating is New York, followed by Seattle and Washington, D.C. San Antonio, Texas topped the list of cities with the best average rider rating.To keep their ratings high, Uber advises riders to clean up after themselves, buckle their seatbelts, be ready on time, be respectful and avoid slamming the door.

world,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/20/health/iyw-cities-losing-36-million-trees-how-to-help-trnd/index.html,US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"By Amy Chillag, CNN "," (CNN)If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it.  Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study.  But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014. If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.  Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development. The most effective way to tackle climate change? Plant 1 trillion trees""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said. Read MoreMore than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says. ""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region."" The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation. Why you should be forest bathing (and we don't mean shampoo)The lost value amounted to $96 million a year. Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society: Heat reduction: Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings, parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere. Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up."" Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil. Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams. Noise reduction:  Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits. Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says. Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property. Improved human health:  Many studies have found connections between exposure to nature and better mental and physical health. Some hospitals have added tree views and plantings for patients as a result of these studies. Doctors are even prescribing walks in nature for children and families due to evidence that nature exposure lowers blood pressure and stress hormones. And studies have associated living near green areas with lower death rates. Wildlife habitat:  Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life. Planning for treesGardening becomes healing with horticultural therapyNowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways."" Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being."" Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""'America's Amazon' is at risk The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.  ""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""How you can help stop tree loss Protect what you have:  Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true."" Prune the dead limbs out of your trees:  If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said. Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice. Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary:  Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow."" Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards  and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control. Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

world,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/11/us/miami-little-haiti-climate-gentrification-weir-wxc/index.html,Miami's Little Haiti wasn't a target for developers. Until the seas started to rise. ,"By Bill Weir, CNN Climate Correspondent","Miami (CNN)In a city where ""sunny day floods"" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of ""location, location, location."" In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable. READ: Millions of US homes at risk of chronic flooding this century, study saysRead MoreEven now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed. ""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are. Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president. Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach. They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere. ""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.  After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation. A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy. ""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them."" He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level. What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead, where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind. Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.

world,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/health/rich-people-climate-change-intl/index.html,How rich people could help save the planet from climate change,"By Stephanie Bailey, CNN"," (CNN)Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints. The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change.Read: While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by itRead MoreBut some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference. Spend wiselyThe buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.    ""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.German architects  Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics?Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes. ""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities. ""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods. DivestmentAs well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in. Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany. But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment. Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest. Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies. Watch: Why climate change worries the world's largest companies""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto. And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""  Wealth means power Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers. There is more CO2 in the atmosphere today than any point since the evolution of humansOtto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.  ""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.Fund climate researchThe wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy. Can coral farms save our reefs?In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues. ""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action:  A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years. Role models The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions. ""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters. Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.

This year he has a new request,"By Faith Karimi, CNN","This is part of a CNN series, ""The Helpers,"" which seeks to showcase people who are going the extra mile to help others and make their communities a better place. (CNN)In their letters to Santa Claus, most kids ask for toys, dolls or maybe a new Xbox. All Jonah Simons said he wanted was a coronavirus cure to save the world. That was last year. Jonah's letter was collected through the US Postal Service's Operation Santa program and published on CNN. It was one of many that revealed the pandemic's toll on children around the country. This holiday season, the 10-year-old Florida boy is back with a different request for Santa.""Dear Santa, it's me Jonah. Do you remember me? I was the one who asked for a covid cure,"" he wrote in a letter addressed to the North Pole and shared with CNN.  ""btw, ty so much for the vaccine! You helped save lives. This year, can I please have a Santa costume to spread your joy around the world?""Read MoreLetters to Santa reveal the toll the pandemic is taking on kidsHis mother, Doe Simons, says Jonah composes his Santa letters himself, without help from his parents.With a relentless virus and threats of the Omicron variant still plaguing a weary nation, Jonah has big plans for the Santa suit.""I want to wear it and go around the neighborhood and spread Santa's joy, ask people what they want for Christmas,"" the fifth-grader told CNN. Jonah Simons' letter to Santa last year. Jonah's mother says she's not positive whether her son still believes in Santa Claus.""But Jonah has experienced Santa-like moments. For example, last year he sent his Xmas wish out into the universe and it came true to a certain extent,"" she says. ""I think writing that letter, even if he didn't believe in Santa, for him was the ability to exert some control over the problem (of the pandemic). It was his way to communicate his feelings and express what he wished would happen.""Helping others is nothing new for Jonah Jonah has been spreading joy in his community of Parkland for years. Growing up in Parkland, where a 2018 massacre left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has had an effect on Jonah and other local children, his mother says. ""What happened here had a lot of impact on children here. He was in middle school, and his school was on lockdown that day,"" she says. ""I think that like Jonah, you're getting kids here who are civic minded and want to make a difference ... When he sees the impact his help has on others, he wants to do more to help."" Jonah turned 10 in July, and in lieu of gifts he asked his family and friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. His birthday effort raised $1,000 in donations from family and friends all over --  even his favorite employees at the local Publix store, his mother says. Jonah Simons holds a photo showing his long hair before he donated it to charity for his 10th birthday this year. He also marked his birthday by donating his hair to Locks of Love, the charity that makes wigs for kids with cancer or other medical conditions.  During a year of lockdown, he teamed up with some friends and grew out his hair to nine inches. ""It was so long, I got bullied for it,"" he says. ""Some people called me a girl.""Jonah's good deeds are not limited to birthdays. He works to help his community all year, including donating and sorting food for the homeless with the organization Feeding South Florida, and packing holiday gifts for children.Doe Simons says her son's charity begins close to home with his grandparents, who are in their 90s and live nearby. Jonah takes out their garbage every week, holds car doors open for them and helps them with their walkers up the elevator, she says.Jonah with his grandparents, Nancy and Jay Simons. He's a would-be doctor whose medicine is love Jonah has long found ways to spread happiness. At age 3 he started dressing up as a doctor to visit loved ones who were ill. ""Ever since he was a little kid, he always wanted a doctors' outfit,"" says his father, Joe Simons. ""He would dress as a doctor because his medicine was love. He would visit family members at the hospital, check their vitals, talk to the nurses and prescribe a special medicine for them: love.""At the start of the pandemic, Jonah asked his parents to buy him a ""pandemic suit"" with the personal protective equipment that health care workers wear at the hospital. He told them he wanted one in case he needed to visit relatives at the hospital and prescribe his love medicine. Jonah hasn't needed to do that yet, so he mostly wears the outfit at home when he's treating his stuffed bear.""His bear is very well taken care of,"" his mother says.When family members are hospitalized, Jonah Simons dresses up as a doctor to visit them. Then he prescribes a special medicine: love. Jonah has big plans for his 11th birthday Jonah's inspiration is Heather Khalil, a Parkland woman who volunteers a lot in the community and has been awarded the Mayor's Medal of Charitable Service. ""She really turned him on to being a public servant,"" Doe Simons says. Jonah wants to be a lot of things when he grows up. Most days he tells people he wants to be a doctor, a lawyer or a police officer. But he thinks he can make a bigger difference as the leader of the free world. ""My best goal is to be a president,"" he says. ""That way, I can make changes to a lot of things and make decisions that help other people."" Until then, he'll continue helping people in his community.Jonah already has big plans for his 11th birthday next July. He's hoping that Covid-19 will be a thing of the past by then, so he can go to sleepaway camp without a mask. He's also signed up to be an ambassador for the homeless. And once again he plans to use his birthday to raise money for charity. Maybe he'll even wear his Santa suit."

""What's so impressive is that these efforts have provided students across Durham the same fortune; in this case, of receiving a substantial portion of food over the extended holiday break.""""I need them to know that I love them""Parker knew she wanted to be a teacher since she was 4 years old, sitting on her mother's bedroom floor, setting up her teddy bears and pretending they were her students. ""I wanted to be a teacher all my life,"" said Parker, who has been a teacher for 11 years. ""This is what I love, it's all I ever wanted to do, I am living my dream.""Now the mother of one teaches more than 400 students, from kindergarten to fifth grade, and her love for them goes beyond the classroom.""I call my students Mrs. Parker's professors. If that tells you anything, it's that I believe in them and I love them so very much,"" Parker said. ""'I need them to know that I love them, to remind them that love is an action word. I will tell them all day, but I will also show them all day.""Her promise to keep all her student's fed began in 2015, when one of her student's parents confided in her they would not have enough food for the children to eat through the holiday break.""She told me, 'I'll be okay, I can go without eating, but I can't let my kids go without eating for two weeks.' It's really hard to know they have stuff like this going on and not to do everything I can,"" Parker said through tears. ""My husband and I started thinking, if one family is asking this question, then there must be more.""Turquoise LeJeune Parker and her husband.On December 14, 2015, Parker sent a text to everyone she knew, asking if anyone would be interested in donating money, so she could provide bags full of food to last them for the whole holiday break.Progress was slow but steady. The first year, she raised $500. Last year, she reached $55,000. But this year proved to be a record, with more than $106,000 donated from people all over the country.""It has left me speechless. I've cried about it a little every day,"" Parker said. ""It took off in a way we could have never expected.""A lifelong effort Within two weeks, Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraisers raised the money needed to purchase enough food to fill up big, brown grocery bags for thousands of children in the district.Each bag contained kid-friendly food, such as cereal, canned goods, granola bars and macaroni and cheese that can be cooked regardless of a family's living situation.""This is a community effort. This is not $106,000 out of my pocket, this is the result of us operating as a collective,"" Parker said. ""It's because of all the people who gave their time, their money, their talents to make sure our kids are taken care of.""With the help of more than 60 volunteers who accompanied Parker to a local Costco, the group purchased the food and spent days packing the bags before delivering them to each school by December 11.Volunteers packing the bags of food.""Mrs. Parker is a school district's dream teacher, a perfect mix of competence and compassion who is committed to serving young people holistically,"" Durham Public Schools said in a statement. ""Her Foodraiser addresses food insecurity head-on, particularly during a time of year when commercialism brings need to the forefront,"" the statement continued. ""Through her efforts, our food-insecure students have access to sustenance when schools are closed for the holidays. She is their lifeline.""The fundraiser's success has inspired Parker to make it a lifelong project, she said, with an aim to feed as many children as possible during both winter and spring breaks."

""People need physical touch. That's what was hard when the pandemic hit. We had to stop doing hair, we had to stop doing barber services. And that might be the nicest touch they've had all day.""As the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year, Raines will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday's gala all receive a $10,000 cash award.Raines struggled for years with financial insecurity, grief and loss after the death of her young son, Demetrius.  This CNN Hero brings 'Beauty 2 the Streetz' of Skid Row""The world looked at me and thought probably the same thing they think about the homeless when they pass them by,"" she said. ""You never know what anyone's going through, you know?""Raines' twin sister urged her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.""I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,"" she said. ""I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.""Initially, Beauty 2 the Streetz was small, with just Raines and her children helping to hand out food, drinks, hygiene kits and beauty products. Raines alone would color people's hair and do their makeup.But then she started livestreaming the events and posting pictures to Instagram, and Beauty 2 the Streetz soon became more well known.Licensed hair stylists, barbers, makeup artists and even big makeup companies reached out to Raines saying they wanted to help.By 2019, Raines had registered Beauty 2 the Streetz as an official non-profit with about two dozen volunteers generously offering their time and efforts to help Skid Row's residents feel beautiful.A happy ending after homeless woman's story featured on TVAs Raines' efforts evolved into a full-scale operation, with music playing and lines forming around the block, she began providing more supplies and essentials: rape whistles, tents, sleeping bags, hygiene items -- and she teamed up with local health officials to offer more services. Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to Downtown Los Angeles to feed and bring supplies to people.Then, as Covid-19 affected many organizations' efforts, services dried up. But Raines pivoted, opting for bagged lunches and a tweaked schedule -- and she kept going.In tandem with the health department, which provided masks, sanitizer and other personal protection items, Raines said her group and other L.A. County non-profits and community projects worked tirelessly to serve the unseen.

Today, as vaccination rates are on the rise and a sense of normality is returning, Raines is offering help by way of food and supplies twice a week and expanding partnerships with local groups to let this often-overlooked population know there is hope.""My sun didn't come out for 30 years. It was 30 years' worth of tomorrows before I even saw the break of day. I would be lying if I said I was always completely happy from doing this. It didn't take away the pain of my son dying.

To win Formula One's drivers' championship at Istanbul Park, the Mercedes driver needed to finish ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas and did so with ease in often treacherous conditions, securing a fourth successive title by winning the race after starting sixth. Lewis Hamilton, Formula One's voice and conscienceLast month Hamilton, 35, surpassed Schumacher's all-time record of 91 Grand Prix wins to become the sport's most successful racer and had long since broken the German's career pole-positions record. Should he remain in the sport, Hamilton will be widely expected to add to his tally of world titles. But, whatever he achieves in the years ahead, his place in F1's pantheon is assured.""For all the kids out there who dream the impossible, you can do it too -- I believe in you guys,"" said Hamilton on his radio after crossing the finishing line for his 94th Grand Prix win.Read MoreHamilton celebrates after winning the Turkish Grand Prix. It was a brilliant drive from one of the all-time greats. After poor practice and qualifying sessions this weekend, question marks were raised as to whether Hamilton could win in Turkey. In wet conditions, it was Hamilton's decisive call on tyres which ultimately proved pivotal, with the Mercedes driver taking control halfway through the race. After victory was achieved, Hamilton embraced his team and, with tears in his eyes, told Sky Sports he was ""lost for words."" ""I have to start with saying such a huge thank you to all the guys that are here, and all the guys that are back at the factory ... I wouldn't be able to do this if I didn't join this team and the journey we've been on has been monumental,"" he said. Lewis Hamilton vs. Michael Schumacher: Who is the greatest? ""I want to say a big thanks to team LH for sticking with me all these years, and to my family. We dreamed of this when I was young and this is way, way beyond our dreams.""Hamilton, who has equaled a record many thought was untouchable when Schumacher won his seventh title in 2004, received congratulatory messages from his fellow drivers, sports stars from around the world and the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""Massively deserved,"" tweeted former world champion Nico Rosberg, a former Mercedes teammate of Hamilton and one of the few drivers to finish ahead of Hamilton in the championship during the Briton's 14-year career. Former Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand tweeted that his compatriot was the ""greatest sportsman this country has ever produced -- no doubts."" Johnson tweeted: ""An impressive victory -- well done @LewisHamilton! You have made us all so proud.""Racing Point's Sergio Perez finished over 31 seconds behind Hamilton in second, while Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third. In finishing 14th, Bottas -- the only man who could have denied Hamilton the title -- was lapped by his teammate and finished with no points.Hamilton with Mercedes chief Toto Wolff. Driving in the same Mercedes machinery, Bottas' performance illustrated just how superior a talent Hamilton is. No one has come close to challenging the world champion during this truncated season and he secured the title with three races still remaining, having won four races in a row and 10 of 14 races so far this year. No driver has been as successful on the track as Hamilton, and no F1 world champion has used his stature like Hamilton, the sport's first and only Black world champion in its 70-year history. The 35-year-old has long been the face of his sport -- his domination and heart-on-sleeve personality has made him arguably the most recognizable British sportsman on the planet -- but, in 2020 especially, he became one of British sport's leading voices supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and, consequently, his sport's voice too.Ahead of the Turkish Grand Prix, Hamilton said campaigning for equal rights had made him ""much prouder"" than the prospect of a seventh world title. But as the checkered flag was waved, it became clear how much this title meant this once-in-a-generation talent. An emotional Hamilton celebrates with his Mercedes team after the race. ""My whole life I probably have, secretly, dreamt as high as this but it felt so far fetched. Seven is just unimaginable,"" Hamilton said on the podium. ""I feel like I'm only just getting started, it's really weird. I feel physically in great shape and mentally, this year, has been the hardest probably for millions of people. ""I know things always look great from here on the big stage, (but) It's no different for us athletes. This has been a challenge, I didn't know how to get through. I managed to keep my head above water and stay focused ... """

A brilliant drive during a rain-soaked Turkish Grand Prix ensured Hamilton not only won the race -- for a record-extending 94th Grand Prix victory -- but also equaled Michael Schumacher's tally of seven world titles, the one remaining record of the German great that the Englishman has not yet surpassed.Lewis Hamilton equals Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titlesIn an Instagram post after his historic feat, Hamilton said the coronavirus pandemic had given him a chance to ""really think about my ultimate purpose.""""Seven World Championships means the world to me, I can't even describe how much, but there's still another race we've yet to win,"" the post read. ""This year I've been driven not just by my desire to win on the track, but by a desire to help push our sport, and our world to become more diverse and inclusive.

He is the face of F1, but also its voice and conscience and has used his stature like no other F1 world champion. F1's first and only Black world champion in its 70-year history, this year he became one of sport's leading voices in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The Briton's own incredible story -- his father, Anthony, juggled three jobs, re-mortgaged the family home and dipped into his life savings to keep his son in karting -- is an example of how notoriously difficult the sport is to enter, mainly because of the financial costs involved.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Hamilton said: ""It is no secret that I have walked this sport alone as the only person of color here.""The fact is I am bi-racial ... and there is colorism that people should perhaps read about.""When I was younger I didn't have anybody in the sport that looked like me so it was easy to think that's not possible to get there because nobody of your colour has ever been there, you don't see any Black people in F1.""But hopefully this sends a message to the kids that are watching ... that it doesn't matter where you come from, whatever your background, it is so important to you to dream big.""You can create your own path and that is what I have been able to do, and it has been so tough. Tough doesn't even describe how hard it has been.""An emotional Hamilton after the race. He later said he would probably celebrate with some minestrone soup and wine. Immediately after the race, Hamilton sat in his car with his head buried in his hands and struggled to hold back the tears.""Very rarely do I lose control of my emotions but I remember those last few laps and I was just telling myself to keep it together,"" Hamilton told reporters. ""When I came across the line it really hit me and I just burst into tears. ""I didn't want the visor to come up and people to see the tears because I always would say you will never see me cry. I remember watching other drivers cry in the past, and I was like, I am never going to do that, but it was too much.""Lewis Hamilton 'won't stop' his fight against racism as FIA rules out investigation into Breonna Taylor T-shirtHamilton needed to finish eight points ahead of his teammate Valtteri Bottas to secure the title at Istanbul Park. He did so with ease, lapping the Finn who crossed the line in 14th to collect zero points. Driving in the same Mercedes machinery, Bottas' performance illustrated just how superior a talent Hamilton is. No one has come close to challenging the world champion during this truncated season and he secured the title with three races still remaining, having won four races in a row and 10 of 14 races so far this year."

""We are coming ... to the hour of truth,"" Le Drian said of ongoing negotiations in Vienna to salvage the landmark deal -- which former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, and Tehran began to withdraw from a year later.""It's not a matter of weeks, it's a matter of days,"" he said. Later on Wednesday, Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani struck an unusually optimistic note, saying that parties to the deal were ""closer than ever to an agreement.""  But Kani warned that negotiations could still fall through.Read More""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,"" he said in a tweet. ""Our negotiating partners need to be realistic, avoid intransigence and heed lessons of past 4yrs."" ""Time for their serious decisions,"" Kani added. Iran and the United States are engaged in a final round of indirect talks -- mediated by China, Russia and European parties to the agreement -- over a return to the 2015 nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).Why the US may find itself forced back into the Middle East  Analysts believe that failure to reach an agreement could lead violence in the crisis-ridden region to spiral out of control, with Iran fast approaching the nuclear threshold that would enable it to develop a nuclear weapon. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated in recent weeks, with Iran-backed Houthi militants launching unprecedented missile and drone attacks on the United Arab Emirates, considered a haven of security in the volatile region. Saudi-led coalition forces fighting the militant group retaliated with the deadliest offensive on Houthi-held parts of northern Yemen in years, killing scores of people and knocking out the country's internet. In his comments Wednesday, Le Drian warned that a breakdown in the Vienna talks would trigger a ""serious crisis."" ""Either [the Iranians] trigger a serious crisis in the days to come -- we could do without that -- or else they accept the agreement which respects the interests of all parties and particularly the interests of Iran,"" he said.  Le Drian said the two and half months of negotiations in Vienna was ""exhausting diplomatic work."" Iran returned to indirect negotiations with the US shortly after President Joe Biden -- who promised to return to the deal as a presidential nominee -- took office. Iran had rejected repeated overtures by the Trump administration to return to the negotiations after the former president withdrew from the deal. "
meast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/middleeast/mideast-summary-02-16-2022-intl/index.html,Why the US may find itself forced back into the Middle East  ,"By Abbas Al Lawati, Nadeen Ebrahim and Eoin McSweeney, CNN","Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN)Perceived disengagement by the United States in the Middle East has led to a strategic shift in regional priorities of late. Alarms about the withering of America's security umbrella perhaps rang loudest in Arab capitals after a 2019 attack on the heart of the Saudi economy prompted a reaction from Washington that was whimpering at best. The thinking was that if Donald Trump, arguably the US President  closest to Gulf states to date, couldn't help them, then no American administration would. The US was seen as abandoning the Middle East. Blamed on Iran, the brazen predawn attack on state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco's facilities knocked off half of Saudi crude output, sending oil prices climbing 19.5%, the most on record. Historically, an unwritten agreement between America and its oil producing Arab allies stipulated that the US would provide protection in return for a steady supply of crude to the global economy from a region that is home to more than two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves. The US has often leaned on the Gulf states to adjust output if the price of a barrel doesn't suit its economic interests, and Arab states have often obliged. Read MoreBut Arab concern about the unraveling of this arrangement has led to stubbornness when it comes to Arab oil policy and, perhaps more importantly, it has prompted some countries to address the very sources of threats to their security. A drone attack in Abu Dhabi could mark a dangerous turning point for the Middle East. Here's what to knowThe United Arab Emirates, which had been militarily active in several regional hotspots, last summer opted to steer its foreign policy towards ""good neighborliness"" and economic interests. It began talks with regional foes such as Iran, reconciled with Turkey, reached out to regional pariah Syria, and signed a peace agreement with Israel. The message was that the foreign policy would work to future-proof its economy as well as its security. But a shock came in January, when it became the target of fatal attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebel group two years after it began withdrawing its military forces from that country. The Iran-backed Houthis said the strikes were in response to continued Emirati interference in Yemen's affairs. The United States, which has been trying to reach a new nuclear agreement with the Houthis' patrons in Tehran, found itself thrust back into the region's spotlight. President Joe Biden, who had removed the Houthis from the US terror list less than a month into taking office in 2021, said he would reconsider the move. The UAE, one of America's closest allies in the region, pushed for more action, including military support. And the US has so far obliged. This month, it sent Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, head of the US Central Command, to the UAE to reinforce the country's defenses by helping it target drones before they are launched. It is also deploying a destroyer with guided missile defense capabilities to patrol the UAE's waters, and a squadron of F-22 fighter jets arrived in Abu Dhabi this week.  With its immediate focus on Russia's troop buildup on Ukrain's borders, , as well as its medium-to-long term eye on China's growing power, the United States' military interests are shifting away from the Middle East. A conclusion of the Iran deal is likely to dampen its threat perception and the very reason for its strong presence in the region, leading to a further disengagement. But, wary of leaving a security vacuum for its adversaries to fill, the message America appears to be sending Gulf states is that while it may be leaving, it will be back as the need arises. Other top Middle East news Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett meets with the King of Bahrain in Manama on Tuesday.Israeli prime minister offers 'goodwill and cooperation' on first Bahrain visit Naftali Bennett met Bahrain's king as well as Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, who said he is looking forward to ""a broader Middle East, free of conflicts, based on principles of mutual respect, understanding, and shared responsibility towards security."" Background: This is the first visit to Bahrain by an Israeli prime minister and comes a year and a half after the two countries agreed to normalize relations. Bennett's trip was his second to a Gulf state, after he visited the United Arab Emirates in December. Why it matters: This is the latest sign of the strengthening ties between some Gulf states and Israel. Shared regional security concerns, in particular fears over Iran, played a key part in underpinning normalization. Among Bennett's first appointments Tuesday was a meeting with US military officials at the Bahrain headquarters of the US Fifth Fleet.  Iranian president to travel to Qatar for gas forum  Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi will travel to Qatar on Thursday to attend the Gas Exporting Countries Forum in Doha, Iran state-run outlet IRNA said on Monday. This comes as the two gas-producing countries look to ""boost cooperation and convergence in energy policies.""  Background: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar in mid-2017 after accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Qatar has repeatedly denied. Tehran and Doha maintained close ties throughout the three-year boycott. Why it matters: Raisi's trip to Qatar is his first to a Gulf-Arab state since he took office and it comes amid the backdrop of multiple attacks by the Iranian-backed Yemen's Houthis on the United Arab Emirates over the last month.  Swedish multinational Ericsson admits it may have inadvertently funded ISIS Shares in Ericsson plummeted on Wednesday after the telecommunications company released the results of an internal investigation which found that the firm could have made payments to ISIS, Reuters reported.    Background: Ericsson started doing business in Iraq after the United Nations lifted an embargo on the country in 2010. The company discovered suspect payments made to circumvent Iraqi customs laws, which were paid in areas that were controlled by ISIS at the time.  Why it matters: Previous corruption allegations in countries such as China and Vietnam cost Ericsson more than $1 billion in 2019. Around the region A conference in Egypt on the African continent's shared heritage caused an outcry and a flurry of racist comments in the North African country last week. Titled 'One Africa: Returning to the Source,' the event was scheduled to take place in Aswan, Egypt on February 25 and 26, coinciding with US commemorations of Black History Month.  The event brochure said it aimed to show that ""all African cultures and peoples are linked together either through ethnicity, language, arts, or culture."" Among the hosts was Washington, DC-based IKG Cultural Resource Center, an organization that focuses on what they call the ""re-discovery of ancient African history and culture."" But in early February, English hashtags such as #StopAfrocentricConference and similar Arabic ones began trending on social media. Some called on Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism to shut down the seminar. The opposition was primarily to the perceived linking of ancient Egyptians to Black people. The debate even found its way to state-backed television, where prominent talk show host Nashaat Eldeehy said the organizers were ""racist"" and had a ""bias toward dark skin."" The backlash on social media turned ugly, with hundreds of commenters hurling racist insults at cultural historian Anthony T. Browder of IKG, one of the conference's main presenters. Soon after, the event was declared canceled on Browder's Facebook page and his page subsequently became unavailable. The cancellation was due to administrative reasons and its ""possible negative impact,"" he told CNN. As the debate raged, others on social media decried the harsh language used as ""racist"" and ""hateful."" New York-based Akhet Tours, one of the conference's organizers, didn't respond to requests for comment. One of the most intensely studied peoples of antiquity, ancient Egyptians have long been the subject of interest for researchers trying to identify their racial origin, culture and way of life.  DNA discovery reveals genetic history of ancient EgyptiansIn 2017, scientists in Germany were able to extract and decode mummies' genome data. In what was a wholly new frontier for Egyptologists, researchers found a strong connection with groups of ancient non-African populations based east of the Mediterranean. The study only sampled Middle Egypt, however, hypothesizing that race origins could differ in Northern and Southern Egypt. ""There is no relation between Blacks and the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization at all,"" said Zahi Hawass, a prominent Egyptologist and former Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, in a phone interview from Cairo. Bemoaning what he saw as ""a completely incorrect"" linking of Blacks to Egyptian civilization by the event organizers, he said the matter should nevertheless be debated by scientists, not lay people on social media. Given the size of the ancient Egyptian civilization, crossover between ethnicities must have taken place, said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo. ""Egypt, from quite early on, was a mixed culture because it is at the crossroads of two continents,"" she said. Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that the ministry was unaware of the conference and the events that followed.  Egypt has said of late that that it's taking steps to support and encourage cultural and economic cooperation across the African continent, emphasizing shared interest and calling for deeper regional integration. Black Arabs of sub-Saharan African origin in the Middle East and North Africa suffer social marginalization and unequal job prospects, and sometimes experience derogatory portrayals in the media, including in Egypt. What to watchTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited the United Arab Emirates on Monday in his first trip to the country in almost a decade. The two nations have found themselves on opposing sides of the ideological spectrum over the last decade, but are now ready to reconcile their differences.

A thaw in Turkish-Egyptian relations is also on the horizon and Turkish-Israeli reconciliation is in the works.   But perhaps the most stunning rapprochement has been between the UAE and Turkey -- few saw that one coming. The two were pitted against each other in almost every regional conflict for the better part of the past decade and found themselves on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum.  In the latest sign of reconciliation, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Abu Dhabi on Monday to meet with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the UAE's de facto ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (known as MBZ) and sign new agreements. It was Erdogan's first official visit to the UAE since 2013.""The reconciliation I saw [as] least likely... [with] the most problems [and] divergent interests, was that of the UAE and Turkey,"" Turkish foreign policy expert Yusuf Erim told CNN.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (L) is welcomed by Emirati officials after arriving at Abu Dhabi's international airport Monday. Read MoreThe rift emerged after Turkey publicly supported the Arab Spring protests that unseated some Arab governments and threatened others in 2011. Erdogan was one of the staunchest backers of Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated groups that played a significant role in some of those protests. That was a red line for Arab monarchies, including the UAE, which viewed those movements as an existential threat.   For Turkey, the turning point with the UAE came in 2016, after Erdogan survived an attempted coup that Turkish officials accused the UAE of backing. The following year, when Qatar's neighbors, including the UAE, boycotted the country for its alleged ties to Islamists, Turkey lent its support, further aggravating Abu Dhabi. The regional powers faced off in a dangerous rivalry driven by their expansionist foreign policy that stretched from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf and East Africa. But nowhere did it unfold as perilously as in Libya, where they engaged in a devastating proxy war from 2019.    Signs of a détente finally began to appear last summer, first with a surprise visit to Ankara by the UAE's national security adviser, then with a call between Erdogan and MBZ.  The call marked  ""a new phase ... in which the UAE seeks to build bridges ... to ensure future decades of regional stability"" said Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president. Local media has referred to the relationship as a ""strategic partnership."" Then, in November, Sheikh Mohammed arrived in Ankara for his first visit in a decade, welcomed with fanfare and a flag-waving cavalry. It had become clear by then that the status quo was unsustainable, especially at a time of perceived American disengagement from the Middle East, which risks leaving many of America's allies with no option but to fend for themselves. There was a clear shared desire to recalibrate both their foreign policies in a way that would benefit their respective economies. The two were perfectly positioned to shift to a more conciliatory approach. Turkey's inflation soars to two-decade high of almost 49%Faced with a coronavirus-related downturn, increased economic competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia and the growing cost of military engagements in the region, the UAE declared last summer that it was adopting a foreign policy U-turn. While it said that its external relations would now be determined by economic interests, the departure of President Donlad Trump and a desire to play a greater diplomatic role in the region was also a factor  in the policy shift. At the same time, Turkey's economy was tanking. Annual inflation reached near 50% and by the end of last year, with its currency losing half its value against the dollar. Ankara could no longer afford to alienate rich Gulf states. Erdogan's rise to power in 2002 has been be attributed to the economy -- he doesn't want it to now become the cause of his downfall. The president has promised to turn the economy around, knowing that failure to do so would have him pay dearly at the polls next year. He's banking on the UAE and other Gulf Arab states to inject billions into Turkey.  ""The economy is very, very important for the Turkish president,"" Erim said. ""A weaker economy before 2023 elections is definitely something he doesn't want, and the Emiratis have the money to be able to provide a booster shot for the Turkish economy.""   The money has already started flowing: the UAE has announced a $10 billion Turkey investment fund and a nearly $5 billion currency swap to boost its foreign exchange reserves. Better relations will also mean a return of Gulf Arab tourists next summer, bringing in much-needed  hard currency.   The economy may be a key driver for Erdogan. But this burgeoning relationship is part of the wider jigsaw of realignment being witnessed in an ever-changing Middle East. Other top Middle East news Iranian oil exports increase as talks in Vienna resume Increased shipments to China have nudged Iran's oil exports past 1 million barrels per day for the first time in almost three years.  Background: Sanctions aimed at cutting Tehran's oil flow were imposed after former United States President Donald Trump exited the 2015 nuclear agreement, but China has provided an outlet through intermediaries. Iran said on Monday that nuclear talks in Vienna have not reached a dead end. Why it matters: Beijing has been consistent in saying the US should lift sanctions on Iran. Oil sales could start to flow again if indirect nuclear talks in Vienna are successful, which could also help lower oil prices, currently standing at $94 -- a seven-year high.  Saudi-led coalition attacks Houthi ministry of communications  The coalition attacked the ministry in Yemen's capital Sanaa on Monday, saying it was used to ""to support hostilities.""   Background: The raid destroyed a Houthi communications system used to operate front communications stations that controls drones, according to the coalition. Why it matters: the raid comes as Iran-backed Houthis step up attacks against coalition forces, particularly the UAE, with drones and missiles.  Iraqi court bars Zebari from running for presidency Iraq's Supreme Federal Court ruled that former Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari is not eligible to run for the presidency amid corruption allegations. Background: The court said a decision by parliament to accept his presidential bid was incorrect and it also barred him from running for the post in the future. Zebari called the court's decision ""an injustice."" Why it matters: The court decision is a blow to populist Shiite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who was the biggest winner in parliamentary elections in October. Parliament had been due to vote on a new head of state last Monday but canceled the vote because it lacked quorum. What we're watching Libyan presidential elections planned for December were postponed after political infighting and administrative delays.

Around the region  Dubai will start charging for plastic bags this summer in preparation for a total ban, Mohammed Abdelbary reports. Twenty-five fils ($0.07) doesn't buy much in the United Arab Emirates; a bag of chips, a stick of gum, or maybe a lollipop if the flavor isn't popular. Starting July 1, however, kids going on a snack run in Dubai will have to account for the price of the plastic bags they carry those snacks in: 25 fils per bag.  The charge will be applied to retail, clothing, restaurants and pharmacies, as well as on delivery and e-commerce orders, the emirate said. The change is a precursor to a complete ban of single-use plastics in two years.  Dubai has also announced plans to cut carbon emissions by 30% by the end of 2030. This is part of the UAE's broader strategy of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Dubai is the first emirate to set a charge on single-use plastic bags.  Over the years, the UAE's deserts and shores have borne the costs of plastic. Single-use plastics cause 50% of camel deaths in the UAE, and 86% of turtle deaths along its shores, according to the government. While 2022 seems to be a big year for awareness around climate and the environment in UAE, 2023 is set to be even bigger as the country will host the COP28 international climate conference in 2023. "
meast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/middleeast/mideast-summary-02-10-2022-intl/index.html,Iraq faces deadlock after 'West-friendly' candidate suspended ,"By Nadeen Ebrahim and Eoin McSweeney, CNN","Abu Dhabi (CNN)He's arguably Iraq's best-known face abroad. Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurd, was the country's longest-serving foreign minister, often hobnobbing with Western diplomats and journalists, but also cultivating strong ties with neighboring Arab states to make his country's case.   But a bid to crown his political career with a run for the presidency faced a major hurdle last week when Iraq's federal court suspended his candidacy due to past corruption charges, causing an election delay that risks exacerbating existing factional divisions.  The presidential election was indefinitely postponed on Monday, stalling the already delayed formation of a new government. The results of October's parliamentary vote, in which pro-Iran factions were dealt a significant loss, were only confirmed in December due to political bickering over the results. A new president would be tasked with asking the winning bloc to form a government.  The suspension was a blow to the ambitions of Zebari's key backer Moqtada al-Sadr, the populist Shiite Muslim cleric who has emerged as a kingmaker and is bent on pushing through a government that excludes his pro-Iran Shiite rivals. Cleric Sadr wins Iraq vote, former PM Maliki close behind, officials saySixty-eight-year-old Zebari was seen as a friend of the west and was known as a successful negotiator. But his political career took a turn in 2016 when, as finance minister, he was accused of corruption and mishandling of public funds. Zebari denied the allegations.    Read MoreAccording to the post-Saddam system of governance in Iraq, the Kurdish minority assumes the presidency, while Shiites run the premiership and the Sunnis take the position of parliament speaker.  Since 2005, the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP)'s rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) has occupied the ceremonial position based on an understanding that the PUK would take Iraq's presidency while the KDP would rule the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan. Zebari was running against PUK's incumbent President Barham Saleh. But the KDP's clout in the Baghdad parliament has grown of late, emboldening the party and winning it new allies like Sadr. The revival of graft allegations has however rattled Zebari's Shiite and Sunni backers, dampening his prospects for the presidency. Sadr, who emerged as the biggest winner the October election after having campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, had to withdraw his support. It's unclear if the KDP will field another candidate that's acceptable to Sadr or stand by Zebari. Sadr reiterated his call for a government of national majority on Tuesday, after meeting Esmail Qaani, head of Iran 's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. ""Neither eastern nor western, a government of national majority,"" he said on Twitter. The slogan was reminiscent of the 1979 Iranian revolution motto ""Neither Eastern nor Western - Islamic Republican."" Iran celebrates the 43rd anniversary of its Islamic revolution this month. If Sadr gets his way and the bloc he leads elects a president of its liking, Iraq could have a government that has quite a different approach to Iran. But the idea of an Iraqi government devoid of Iran's Shiite allies won't sit well in Tehran, and those prospects risk a backlash from pro-Iran groups, many of whom are heavily armed.   Other top Middle East news Iranian man beheads teenage wife, shocking the country A video showing a smiling man walking in Iran with his teenage wife's severed head in his hand has shocked the country. His mother was quoted as saying her son had threatened to kill his wife previously and was responsible for the murder. Background: The girl had reportedly fled to Turkey four months before being persuaded to return to Iran by her father. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency referred to the killing as an ""honor"" murder.  Why it matters: The girl was reportedly 12 years old at the time of her marriage. The issue has again raised concern over the country's laws around murder and gender-based violence. Biden, Saudi king discuss energy supplies amid rising prices US President Joe Biden and King Salman of Saudi Arabia discussed energy supplies in the face of soaring fuel prices and developments in the Middle East, including Iran and Yemen, in a call on Wednesday. Background: Last week, oil producing states agreed to stick to moderate rises in its production as they struggle to meet existing targets amid calls for more crude from top consumers to cap surging prices. Why it matters: High oil prices are a risk to the Biden administration ahead of November's mid-term congressional elections in which his fellow Democrats will defend slim majorities in the Senate and US House of Representatives. Dubai plans to attract 50 multinational companies within three years  The plan is part of a three-year strategy adopted by the Dubai International Chamber to boost the emirate's status as a global trade hub. Background: Dubai is the Middle East's business hub and is already home to the regional headquarters of several multinational firms.  The government said it will also support 100 Dubai-based companies with international expansion. Why it matters: Dubai is facing increased competition from Saudi Arabia in attracting international business. The kingdom has given foreign firms until the end of 2023 to set up headquarters or risk losing out on government contracts.What we're watching The US has said that the issue of American Iranians held in the Islamic Republic is separate from its nuclear talks with Tehran, but it has also said that it is unlikely to reach a deal without their release.

Around the region Lebanese culture minister Wissam el-Mortada (second from left) attends a ceremony at Nabu Museum on February 6 to hand 337 swiped artifacts back to Iraq.Lebanon returns hundreds of stolen artifacts to Iraq, some dating back to the world's oldest civilization ""It belongs in a museum,"" is a famous quote by the swashbuckling fictional archaeology professor Indiana Jones, said in relation to artifacts being sold at high prices.  Lebanon has learned it's also important to ensure they haven't been stolen before they reach a museum.  The Levantine state is giving back to Iraq 337 swiped antiquities, some thousands of years old, many of which were looted during decades of conflict and war.  The clay figurines were housed in Nabu Museum in northern Lebanon and date back to different eras of the Mesopotamian civilization, the Iraqi foreign ministry said. The region in southwestern Asia is where the world's earliest civilization is believed to have developed.  While it's difficult to tell how many pieces are missing, Iraq hopes to recover more artifacts from several European countries.  Opened in 2018, Nabu is a private museum that has been the subject of controversy in the past, when suspicions arose that some of its collection was dug up illegally in Syria and Iraq. It returned five Roman artifacts to Syria from the ancient city of Palmyra in January.  Named after the Mesopotamian god of literacy, it houses a collection of tablets dating from 2330 to 540 BC. Time Capsule The Iranian Islamic Republic Army demonstrates in solidarity with people in the street during the Iranian revolution. They are carrying posters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious and political leader.   Iran commemorates the anniversary of its Islamic Revolution on February 11. The country's former ruler, Shah Reza Pahlavi, was toppled on that date in 1979, his regime soon to be replaced with the Islamic Republic that stands today. The Shah had the support of the US but not of his people, disgruntled by the country's economic woes, political repression, and the government's failure to deliver meaningful reform. Opposition parties threw their support behind Shiite cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled critic of the Shah, believing he was their best bet to remove the monarch. Anti-regime protests erupted in January 1978 and continued for months, with hundreds of protesters dying at the hands of government forces. On February 1, 1979, Khomeini returned to Iran, welcomed by a million-plus crowd expressing their support for him, and by February 11, the Shah's regime was officially over.

Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) referred to the alleged murder as an ""honor killing.""​A video began circulating showing the husband, Sajjad Heydari, walking in the provincial capital of Ahvaz while smiling and carrying his wife's severed head, IRNA reported. Local authorities have confirmed that widely shared images that purport to be Heydari are from the same incident, a source with knowledge of the statements told CNN. The video, seen by​ CNN, showed Heydari holding a knife in one hand and ​the girl's head in another. CNN has not been able to reach Heydari or his family, and it is unclear whether he has an attorney. In an interview published in Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency, Sajjad's mother is quoted as saying her son had threatened to kill his wife previously, and was responsible for her killing. Read MoreDeath of 14-year-old Iranian girl in so-called 'honor killing' sparks outrageThe girl, who has been identified ​as ""Mona"" by IRNA, and as ""Ghazal"" by Fars -- who reportedly spoke with the husband's family -- had fled to Turkey four months before being persuaded to return to Iran by her father, according to an interview with the girl's mother-in-law, published on Fars.​The girl was 12 years old at the time of her marriage to Heydari, according to IRNA. In an interview with the girl's father, published Tuesday in Fars, he is quoted as saying that he had obtained a legal certificate allowing his daughter to be married. The minimum age of marriage in Iran is 13 for girls and 15 for boys. CNN has been unable to confirm Sajjad Heydari's age.​She returned from Turkey on Friday, according to Fars, and was killed soon after.Heydari was arrested, along with his brother, who ​allegedly helped him commit the crime, prosecutor Abbas Hosseini Pouya told Fars.""The accused will definitely be dealt with severely,"" Pouya told Fars.Those who published and shared the video ​may also face arrest, Pouya said. The incident has prompted Iran's government to push forward a review of a draft law that aims to protect women against domestic violence, Ensieh Khazali, the vice president for Women's and Family Affairs, a cabinet-level position, said in a tweet, according to IRNA.Teenager arrested for beheading sister as mother allegedly held victim's legs""The judiciary is determined to inflict the most severe punishment on ​(the killer and a suspected accomplice) in accordance with the law,"" Khazali said.For years, Iranian women​'s rights activists have campaigned for ​such a law to prevent ""violence against women and prosecute their abusers,"" Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in 2020. The draft law has ""a number of positive provisions"" HRW said, including the creation of restraining orders and the formation of a committee to ""draft strategies and coordinate government responses to violence against women.""The law would also require prejudicial mediation in domestic dispute​s that involve a father or a husband.But the law still ""falls short of international standards,"" HRW said, adding that it ""does not criminalize some forms of gender-based violence, such as marital rape and child marriage.""Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran ​(ICHRI), said that ""the beheaded child bride...might be alive today if Iran's government had enacted laws against the cruel practice of child marriage, and protections against domestic violence.""The crime comes only two years after another high profile ""honor killing,"" ​in which a 14-year-old was ​allegedly killed by her father with a sickle after she ran away from her family home in northern Iran's Talesh County with a 29-year-old man."

Israel said the men were responsible for at least five shooting attacks on Israeli army positions in the West Bank over recent months and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the operation showed there was ""no immunity for terrorists.""But the Palestinian Authority Foreign Ministry described the men's deaths as an assassination.

Here's what to look out for ,"By Abbas Al Lawati and Eoin McSweeney, CNN"," (CNN)Iran and the United States return to Vienna on Tuesday for another round of talks aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear agreement abandoned by the Trump administration. There have been enough indications of progress from both sides to suggest that negotiations have entered a critical phase, but a number of issues remain unresolved.  Those include the scope of sanctions relief for Iran, sequencing of events, verification mechanisms, Iran's compliance process,  Tehran's demand for guarantees the US will stick to the deal, says Sanam Vakil, senior research fellow at London's Chatham House think tank.  The latest sign of progress came on Friday when the US restored sanctions waivers. The waivers, rescinded under former President Donald Trump, had allowed Russian, Chinese and European companies to carry out non-proliferation work to make it harder for Iranian nuclear sites to be used for weapons development. The State Department hopes the waiver restoration will help the talks in Vienna. Here are some issues to watch out for that may give an indication of how the talks will progress: Read More""Maximum pressure"" sanctions The term refers to sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that go beyond those imposed by the 2015 nuclear agreement, aimed at putting pressure on the Islamic Republic to renegotiate the pact after Trump abandoned it in 2018. Iran has said that it won't accept a new deal that doesn't remove Trump's sanctions.  Some of those sanctions, which were imposed over human rights and terrorism issues, may be harder to justify lifting, say Vakil and Michael Horowitz, head of intelligence at Le Beck International, a risk management consultancy in Bahrain. It may be in the US' interest to keep those sanctions as continued leverage on Tehran, according to Horowitz. Face-to-face talks Despite Washington's repeated calls for face-to-face talks, Iran has refused to sit at the table with American diplomats, opting instead to negotiate via intermediaries until the US offers a ""good agreement."" But late last month, it indicated for the first time that it would be open to direct negotiations. If the two sides find themselves at the same table in future talks, consider it a significant development, but Horowitz says it may be too early for such a move given the domestic backlash in Iran at the suggestion last month.  Fate of dual nationals held in Iran Four Iranian-Americans are imprisoned in the Islamic Republic, an issue the US says is being used by Tehran to strengthen its hand in negotiations. America had previously said that talks on the prisoners were separate from the nuclear negotiations, but US Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley recently indicated that a new nuclear deal was unlikely to be reached without Iran releasing those prisoners. Guarantees of adherence to the pact Iran has insisted that it won't return to a deal that can be abandoned once again, and has demanded guarantees that it won't pull out in the future. Diplomats have rubbished the demand as unrealistic. ""I don't see how the US would commit to not walking back on the deal,"" says Horowitz. ""But there are, I think, some creative ways that the US and Europe, can [use to] reassure Iran."" For instance, the Europeans could work to mitigate the impact of a future US withdrawal, he says. ""The US can curate a portfolio of transactional assurances that can help Iran sell the deal back home as being a sustainable and viable one,"" says Vakil. Other top Middle East news Iraq cancels vote for new president after court postpones frontrunner's nomination  Most of Iraq's parliament boycotted a session Monday to elect a new head of state, indefinitely postponing the vote. The boycott came after the Federal Court suspended the nomination of Hoshyar Zebari, a frontrunner for the presidency.  Background: The court's decision cited an unresolved case in relation to old corruption charges, which means Zebari doesn't meet the ""good reputation"" requirement to be head of state. Why it matters: The decision was a blow to populist Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who was the biggest winner in an October election. He had vowed to push through a government that would exclude Iranian allies. Sadr had supported Zebari's bid. Once elected, the president will call on the largest parliamentary alliance to form a government.Tunisia's power struggle escalates as president moves to sack judicial council Police closed the building housing the Supreme Judicial Council in Tunisia a day after the president moved to dissolve the country's top legal body. The council has rejected the president's move, saying it will continue to carry out its duties.  Background: President Kais Saied has often expressed his disapproval over judicial delays on rulings in cases of corruption and terrorism. In July, he ousted the government and froze parliament's activities before appointing a new prime minister. Why it matters: The president's interventions have been seen as undermining the democratic gains of Tunisia's 2011 revolution that ended autocratic rule and triggered the Arab Spring. China says Saudi crown prince missed opening ceremony due to scheduling issue  Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman didn't attend the Beijing 2022 opening ceremony due to ""his schedule,"" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.Background: The crown prince was one of the highest-profile world leaders due at Friday's event, which was overshadowed by boycotts by Western nations including the US, UK and Canada.  Why it matters: In recent years China has built good relations with Middle East powerhouses such as Saudi Arabia, even helping manufacture ballistic missiles for the kingdom.  If the prince had attended the ceremony, it would have signaled deepening ties between the two countries.

Around the region A perceived plan to change the Islamic-inscribed flag of Saudi Arabia has caused a storm on social media, Celine Alkhaldi reports. The kingdom's Shura Council, an advisory body appointed by the king, unanimously approved last week a draft amendment to a 50-year-old policy governing the flag and national anthem. The decision, perceived by some as an attempt to distance the country from Islam, stirred controversy that prompted the government to issue a clarification.    The government's Anti-Rumor Authority responded to the outcry by tweeting a statement denying ""the news circulating about changing the contents of the Saudi flag and national anthem."" The Saudi flag is inscribed with the Islamic testament of faith: ""there is no god but God; Mohammed is the Messenger of God"". Its color, green, is associated with Islam. Religion pervades most aspects of life in the kingdom, but its influence, as well as that of the clergy, has been significantly curtailed under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  Some of his reforms, including allowing gender mixing, concerts and lifting of restrictions on women, have been welcomed by some, but left others disgruntled in the birthplace of Islam. Some opponents of the flag policy change linked it to efforts at liberalizing the kingdom. Lawmaker Saad al-Otaibi, who presented the proposal to the council, explained that adjusting the policy would prevent desecration of the flag, local media reported. Changes include defining places and times of the flag's hoisting. The change was intended to align with the kingdom's ""path to modernity,"" he added.

The development comes after a new report by the business news website Calcalist alleging that phones belonging to, among others, several heads of government ministries, a leading businessman, a co-defendant in the trial of Benjamin Netanyahu, and even one of the former Prime Minister's sons, were infiltrated with Pegasus spyware.  It is the latest report by the website, which is linked to Israel's leading Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, detailing alleged police use of the NSO Group-made Pegasus software. Like its previous reporting on the story, the website did not provide any information about its sources, nor did it provide any dates when the alleged illegality took place.  Earlier Calcalist reports have focused on the alleged failure to seek authorization for the use of Pegasus but the latest allegations go much further by suggesting widespread surveillance of people under no suspicion of any wrong doing. ""Calcalist can reveal for the first time a list of dozens of citizens who were targeted by Israel Police, having their phones hacked by NSO spyware and their personal information swiped and filed away. The surveillance was conducted to phish for intelligence even before any investigation had been opened against the targets, and without judicial warrants,"" the article began. Israeli officials deny report that police are using cellphone spying software on citizens without court approvalRead MoreWithin hours of the report's publication, Israel's Public Security Minister, who has overall responsibility for the police, announced he was asking Cabinet colleagues to approve the establishment of a government commission of inquiry into the use of spyware and other electronic snooping technologies, ""to investigate in depth the violation of civil rights and their privacy in the years in question."" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett also commented, saying, ""The reports about Pegasus, if they are true, are very serious. This tool and similar tools, are important tools in the fight against terrorism and severe crime, but they were not intended to be used in phishing campaigns targeting the Israeli public or officials -- which is why we need to understand exactly what happened."" The allegations pile further pressure on Israel's police forces, which have been under fire since the first Calcalist report last month alleging use of Pegasus. Last week, in a vaguely-worded statement, police admitted that what they called ""additional findings"" from an internal investigation had been passed on to the Attorney General's office, which opened its own investigation into how Israeli police monitors electronic communications. Speaking on Israeli radio Monday morning, police spokesman Eli Levy insisted that all police actions investigated thus far had been carried out legally. ""Up to this point, there has been no known wrong-doing in the work of the police. We are transparent and open to any investigation,"" he said. ""If it is found that a police officer or an official wearing a uniform has committed a criminal offense, he will be prosecuted instantly."" Apple sues NSO Group over spywareAmong those whose phones were allegedly infected with Pegasus is Iris Elovitch, a co-defendant in the corruption trial of former Prime Minister Netanyahu. Lawyer Jack Chen, who is representing Elovitch's husband, Shaul, who is also on trial, said the revelations meant the trial should be suspended.  One of Netanyahu's senior Likud party colleagues, Yisrael Katz, echoed that sentiment on Twitter. ""In light of what has been exposed in the past few days, and this morning, I demand an immediate freeze of all of the legal proceedings against Binyamin Netanyahu ... A gross attempt was made here to topple an incumbent prime minister through illegal means and there is a grave threat to democracy in the State of Israel,"" Katz tweeted.    Proceedings in the trial, being held at Jerusalem's District Court, continued Monday as planned, though prosecutors were given until 7:00 p.m. to say whether the current witness, Dana Neufeld, a legal advisor at the Communications Ministry during the period in question, was among those under surveillance.

On the surface, the US commando raid in Syria that left ISIS chief Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi dead may look like a game-changer, but experts warn the resurgence of the group is likely to press on undeterred.  ""Thanks to the bravery of our troops, this horrible terrorist leader is no more,"" declared US President Joe Biden, hours after the end of the operation that targeted Qurayshi in the Syrian rebel enclave of Idlib.   Biden may have hoped for the same fanfare that greeted his predecessors when they took out ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before him. But ISIS experts were quick to throw cold water on claims of a significant blow to the group. Qurayshi is no Baghdadi, and a group that once commanded a piece of territory bigger than the United Kingdom is now a guerrilla insurgency with its leadership scattered.  But the group that delivered genocide, mass execution and oppression has proven that it remains a formidable force. A United Nations report released Friday said the terror group is far from vanquished. In fact, it remains a potent force in Iraq and Syria, with a growing presence in Afghanistan and West Africa, according to the UN analysis.The report -- compiled by UN experts on ISIS and al Qaeda before Qurayshi's death and covering the last six months of 2021 -- said ISIS may still have up to $50 million in its coffers.  Read MoreEven before his demise, according to the UN experts, ISIS had lost several important members of its senior echelon. And yet the group remains a threat. Instability in both Iraq and Syria ""indicate that an eventual ISIL resurgence in the core region cannot be ruled out,"" the report concludes, referring to the group by its alternate acronym.ISIS leader killed in US raid had dark past but spent years under the radarIn Iraq, ISIS stages attacks on an almost daily basis. In Lebanon, officials says it has found fertile recruiting ground in the city of Tripoli. And the United Nations says ISIS may still have $50 million in its coffers and up to 10,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq.  Last week ISIS launched its biggest attack in three years when the group's fighters attempted to free inmates from a prison in northeast Syria.  It lost the week-long standoff, and hundreds of ISIS inmates, including children, as well as scores of US-backed Kurdish fighters, died in the fighting. The uptick in ISIS violence has the region's security officials on edge, precisely because the picture is murkier  than it was in ISIS' heyday, when the group seized Mosul in 2014. Then, a US-led coalition, as well as Iran-backed Shia armed groups, fought years-long battles that ultimately led ISIS territory to vaporize. Now ISIS is virtually invisible. Its spread is detectable but appears to not have a single source.   For that reason, the US raid -- as dazzling as the optics may have been to some -- raises more questions than it answers. What was the ISIS leader doing in Idlib, where the group's ostensible rivals Hay'at Tahrir al Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate, dominates? How was he able to command cells further afield in Syria and Iraq?    Far from reassuring observers and security officials, the devil in the details of Thursday's operation seems to confirm what experts have been saying for months: Qurayshi was the head of a snake, but it will require a lot more sophistication and international cooperation to exterminate the pit from which he came.  Other top Middle East news France to reinforce UAE air defense system after drone attacks France said Friday it had agreed to reinforce the United Arab Emirates' defense system, including the deployment of Rafale jets, following Houthi attacks. Background: The UAE said Wednesday that it had intercepted three drones that entered its airspace. Top Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr blamed an obscure Iraq-based militia for targeting ""a Gulf state."" Why it matters: The UAE has been lobbying the international community for united front against the threats it faces from Iran-backed groups in the region, pushing the US to label the Houthis a terrorist group. The US also pledged to beef up air support for the UAE earlier last week. Denmark finds members of Iranian opposition group guilty of spying for Saudi Arabia A Danish court on Friday found three members of an Iranian Arab opposition group guilty of financing and supporting terrorist activity in Iran in collaboration with Saudi intelligence services, local news wire Ritzau reported. Background: The three members of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA) were arrested two years ago and have been in custody since.  Why it matters: A Norwegian-Iranian was sentenced to seven years in May last year for spying for an Iranian intelligence service and plotting to assassinate one of the ASMLA-members.

Around the region  Environmentally friendly ""flying"" boats may soon be hovering over Dubai's waters. Home to man-made islands, a marina and a creek, Dubai has a lot of boats. Now, the futuristic Gulf city is eyeing a cutting-edge addition to its marine landscape with the introduction of hydrofoil boats. While traditional boats float, hydrofoils, as the vessels are known, take advantage of the wind by lifting the hull above the water, thus reducing drag and increasing speed. Hydrofoils aren't new, but Dubai's version claims to be the first to have zero carbon emissions. ""We have already done it for roads, why not the water?"" said French yachtsman Alain Thébault, who has partnered with Swiss-based startup THE JET ZeroEmission to build the world's first hydrogen powered hydrofoil in Dubai.  His project fits right into the emirate's climate-friendly plans. Under its clean energy strategy, Dubai is aiming to produce three-quarters of its energy requirements from clean sources by 2050. The boat is expected to glide in silence above the city's waters at up to 46 miles per hour, with a capacity of up to 12 passengers, by next year, when the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is part, plans to host the 28th International Climate Summit, known as COP28.

meast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/middleeast/bahrain-natural-pearls-industry-spc-intl/index.html,Eco-friendly and ultra-luxury: How Bahrain hopes to revive its natural pearl industry,"By Nadia Leigh-Hewitson, CNN"," (CNN)An island kingdom just off the Arabian Peninsula, known as the first emirate nation to discover oil in 1932, wants to re-establish itself as the global center for sustainable pearls.Natural pearls are one of the most sustainable and ethical luxury gems, both conflict-free and climate-friendly. With pearl beds bigger than Manhattan, Bahrain is looking to revive its traditional pearl industry -- once the backbone of the country's economy.For centuries, Bahrainis have free-dived to collect pearl oysters from the sea floor. ""Most families, before the discovery of oil in Bahrain, were associated with the trade of pearling -- from merchants to divers, drillers, dealers,"" says Faten Ebrahim Mattar, a sixth-generation pearl merchant from the Mattar family, which has been in the business since the 1850s. ""Working in the natural pearl business is one of the toughest trades, due to the rarity of your star element,"" she says.According to Mattar, Bahrain has a reputation as the ""Mecca of Pearling."" In 2012 UNESCO declared the Bahraini pearl beds a World Heritage site, calling the region the ""last remaining complete example of the cultural tradition of pearling and the wealth it generated at a time when the trade dominated the Gulf economy.""Read MoreBahrain has a long and lucrative history of pearling. Pictured: pearl merchants show off their wares in March 1953.""Our geographic location as an island in the middle of the trade route from Iraq to India attributed to Bahrain being an important marketplace for this business,"" says Mattar. She adds that some marine biologists believe that convergence of saltwater with fresh natural springs in the middle of the Gulf creates a unique environment for pearls to grow with high luster.Though the value of the natural pearl plummeted after the advent of cultured pearls in Japan in the early 1900s, the gems are experiencing a renaissance as consumers look for more responsibly sourced jewelry and one-of-a-kind pieces. Natural pearls as ""ultra-luxury""At the beginning of the 20th century, to own a perfectly shaped pearl was a sign of extravagant wealth. Though a pearl necklace may no longer be traded for a New York townhouse, today natural pearl jewelry can fetch upwards of $300,000 at auction with some historic pieces selling for up to $32 million.Natural pearls occur when a foreign object -- such as a grain of sand, or parasite -- finds its way inside a pearl oyster. To protect itself, the oyster produces an iridescent mineral substance to engulf the object.With natural pearls occurring in only 1 in 10,000 oysters and each one growing organically over several years into a unique shape, every natural pearl is both rare and inimitable.Unlike cultivated pearls from farms, which often involves deliberately inserting a foreign object (usually a bead) into the oyster and can be damaging to the environment, Bahrain's natural pearls develop without any human interference.Collection is done in the least obtrusive way with licensed divers carefully gathering oysters by hand, says Noora Jamsheer, CEO of the Bahrain Institute for Pearls and Gemstones (DANAT), which was established in 2017 to support a national plan to revive the pearl sector.Natural pearls occur in only 1 in 10,000 oysters and pearl divers must gather them by hand.In collaboration with the Supreme Council for the Environment and the Coast Guard, DANAT monitors and shields the health of the pearl beds, periodically suspending diving in certain areas to allow for growth. The institute tests and certifies the pearls and offers hands-on pearl grading education.Despite being impacted by the pandemic, DANAT says the natural pearl market is seeing steady growth. According to the institute, all parts of the industry in Bahrain have grown in the last year, and 2021 saw significant growth in the number of pearl diving licenses issued -- including, for the first time, licenses being given to female pearl divers.""We saw a strong rebound in 2021 in the growth in the luxury market,"" says Jamsheer. ""We're not talking about the Guccis and the Louis Vuittons; it's happening in the sector of ultra-luxury, extremely exclusive, one of a kind -- and this is where natural pearls fall.""Back in styleThe greatest challenge to the natural pearl market today is the cultured pearl, says Kenneth Scarratt, president of the International Confederation of Jewelry (CIBJO) Pearl Commission.Scarratt, a world-renowned expert who has worked in the pearl sector for 50 years and helped run DANAT when the institute first launched, says that the crash in value of the natural pearl was caused by the advent of cultured pearls in Japan, followed by the Great Depression in the 1930s.""Once the Great Depression was over, the cultured pearl business had grown exponentially,"" says Scarratt. ""The super-rich were no longer buying pearls, but cultured pearls were an affordable option for the ordinary person.""To the untrained eye, cultured pearls are indistinguishable from natural ones. With natural pearls making millions at auction and their cultured counterpart available for as little as $50, it's easy to see why consumers would opt for the perfect imitation.Tiffany is selling its most expensive piece of jewelry everBut Scarratt says he has seen interest in natural pearls rematerialize over the past decade. ""There's a growing segment of the market that looks out for what is rare. That segment of the market is looking for natural pearls,"" he explains.Scarratt says most of the pearls found in Bahrain are ""seed pearls,"" small pearls used in intricate jewelry designs and high fashion garments.

Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi killed himself and his family after igniting a bomb at the beginning of the operation, according to a senior Pentagon official. Qurayshi succeeded ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019 after his demise. When Qurayshi took over the organization, the vast swathes of territory the group controlled -- an area larger than the size of the United Kingdom at its peak -- had largely vaporized. Observers dubbed him a Caliph without a Caliphate. Yet he sought to reinvigorate the organization. In recent months, he oversaw a resurgence of ISIS in various parts of Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Iraq reported an uptick in violence linked to ISIS. In the Kurdish-controlled northeastern part of Syria, the group staged a lethal days-long attempted jail break in a bid to free ISIS members. Hundreds of inmates, including children, died. Scores of Kurdish fighters also perished in the clashes. In Lebanon, multiple regional and local reports have indicated that the group has been recruiting scores of  members from the northern city of Tripoli, one of the areas hardest hit by the country's devastating economic crisis. Read MoreThroughout it all, Qurayshi -- who was known by several aliases -- kept a low profile, much like his predecessor. The US Rewards for Justice program offered a reward of $10 million for information about him. His history in the organization is also murky. But snippets from interviews with ISIS prisoners paint a picture of a man with a dark past as a member of Baghdadi's inner-most circle. Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi killed himself and his family after igniting a bomb at the beginning of the operation, according to a senior Pentagon official. Qurayshi became a ""religious scholar"" with al Qaeda in Iraq, before the group rebranded itself as the Islamic State. In 2014, he ""helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of the Yazidi religious minority in northwest Iraq,"" the Rewards for Justice notice says. Much of the Yazidi community lived in an area close to what some analysts believe was Qurayshi's home town of Tal Afar in northern Iraq. In 2014, after ISIS had taken Tal Afar and Mosul, the group enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and children and murdered thousands of Yazidi men, in what the United Nations has called a genocide. The Commission for International Justice and Accountability, an NGO that investigates and gathers evidence of major international crimes such as terrorism, said Qurayshi was ""one of the key architects of the Islamic State slave trade in Yazidi women and children.""""He personally enslaved and raped captive women,"" said Nerma Jelacic, the group's deputy director. Counter-terrorism expert Daniele Raineri has noted that he was ""the deputy who managed to spend the years since 2010 almost totally under the radar."" But when others in the ISIS hierarchy were taken or died in battle, he became one of the group's leading ideologues. In a 2018 interview with Saudi-owned al Arabiya, a senior ISIS detainee in Iraq, Ismael al Eithawi called Qurayshi ""the most prominent of Baghdadi's surrounding circle."" A 2018 internal ISIS document repeatedly describes Qurayshi as ""the deputy"" to Baghdadi. He died in an operation similar to that which killed Baghdadi. And it is yet unclear if the operation will stem the group's resurgence or if the cycle of extremist violence will continue undeterred. ISIS has not acknowledged his death and it's as yet unclear who may replace him. Few if any of Baghdadi's inner circle are thought to be still at large.CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report."

Erdogan accused the rights group, the Council of Europe, of ignoring its sovereignty on Thursday, saying: ""We do not recognize those who do not recognize our courts. We expect our own courts to be respected. We are sorry but we will not respect those who do not respect us."" In October, Erdogan ordered the ambassadors of 10 countries, including the United States, France and Germany, to be declared persona non grata after calling for Kavala's release.Kavala is among Turkey's most high-profile detainees. He was first arrested in 2017 on charges related to the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul. The trial was closely watched by rights groups, who had accused the Turkish government of using the judicial system to crack down on dissenting voices. Though Kavala was acquitted in 2020, that verdict was overturned and new charges were brought against him for his alleged involvement in the 2016 attempted coup.Turkey's president has ordered 10 ambassadors to be declared 'persona non grata' for backing jailed activistThe Council of Europe said in a Wednesday statement its decision to move forward with infringement proceedings against Turkey, a founding member of the organization, ""clearly indicates the serious concerns related with the case of Mr. Kavala, who has been kept in prison for years without a conviction."" Read More""Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU's concerns regarding Turkish judiciary's adherence to international and European standards,"" it said.The European Court of Human Rights had previously ruled that Kavala's detention ""took place in the absence of sufficient evidence"" and ordered his release. Kavala has denied the charges levied against him. His lawyer, lkan Koyuncu, said Thursday that espionage charges leveled against Kavala were ""fabricated."" ""Osman Kavala's pre-trial detention for four years and three months is a disgrace to the judiciary,"" Koyuncu said. Rights groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International applauded the Council's decision.

It's unclear to whom the drones belonged. Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, a possible culprit, have not claimed responsibility. The UAE is a member of the Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Houthis since 2015. The coalition has been fighting to restore Yemen's internationally recognized government after it was ousted by Houthi forces, who now control much of the country.In 2019, the UAE pulled most of its troops from Yemen, after privately deeming the war unwinnable. The campaign failed to crush the rebels and exacted a huge humanitarian toll. Read MoreUS, UAE intercepts ballistic missile during Israeli President's visitThe UAE had largely avoided the firing line, with Houthis opting instead to strike Saudi Arabia until recently. The Houthis have launched a series of attacks on the Emiratis, beginning with a January 17 drone strike that killed three foreign workers in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The Saudi-led coalition responded with a weeklong offensive in Yemen, killing scores of people and knocking out the internet. In recent days, Houthi forces have launched several ballistic missiles aimed at US and UAE forces deployed in the country -- including one attack that came during Israeli President Isaac Herzog's historic visit to the country. The missiles launched in those attacks were intercepted by US-deployed Patriot missile defense systems, and there were no casualties. On Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed that the US would be deploying fifth-generation fighters to assist against the Houthi threat. The move was welcomed by the UAE.The UAE has also been lobbying the US to redesignate the Houthis as a foreign terror organization, which US President Joe Biden said is ""under consideration.""January's attacks have surprised residents of the UAE. Abu Dhabi has repeatedly been ranked one of the safest cities in the world.

Amnesty's nearly 300-page report, released Tuesday, details ""inhuman or inhumane acts of forcible transfer, administrative detention, torture, unlawful killings and serious injuries, and the denial of basic rights and freedoms or persecution committed against the Palestinian population,"" creating ""an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination over Palestinians."" ""Amnesty International concludes that the State of Israel considers and treats Palestinians as an inferior non-Jewish racial group,"" it said. Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, told CNN's Becky Anderson on Tuesday that ""we call it apartheid because it is apartheid under international law.""""What we have found is a system, a system of laws, policies, practices, intricate bureaucratic bureaucratized, that are there in order to ensure control and domination of the Palestinian people,"" Callamard said.Read MoreLike two recent reports focusing on the same issue -- from Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, and from New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) -- Amnesty's report examines Israeli policy in both the Palestinian territories, land occupied by Israel since 1967 but never formally annexed, and in Israel. Israeli settlers rage through Palestinian town, marking the latest 'nationalistically motivated' attack in the region""Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has pursued an explicit policy of establishing and maintaining a Jewish demographic hegemony and maximizing its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis,"" it said. Even before the report was formally released, Israel denounced it as ""false and biased."" In an online briefing with journalists held in advance of the report's publication, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said that Amnesty was ""using double standards and demonization in order to delegitimize the existence of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people."" ""These are the exact components from which modern antisemitism is made,"" the foreign ministry said in a separate statement. That response was echoed in a joint statement by several Jewish groups in the United States on Sunday, including the American Israel Israeli Public Affairs Committee and the Anti-Defamation League, which said Amnesty's document ""fuels those anti-Semites around the world who seek to undermine the only Jewish country on earth, while simultaneously cheapening and downplaying the horrific suffering that was a result of apartheid in South Africa."" Callamard responded to these criticisms by telling CNN that ""going after the messenger is one way of ensuring that there is no discussion on the substance, we need to focus on the reality of life for Palestinians. Amnesty stand by its report and stand by its right to critique Israel every time Israel violates international law. That is not anti-Semitic.""The term apartheid originated in South Africa, where a system of racial segregation and ""separate development"" was official policy between 1948 and 1994. The system was designed to confine non-Whites to ""self-governing Bantustans,"" stripping them of their citizenship, with a system of passes and identity papers controlling where non-Whites could travel and work. Israel has always rejected comparisons with apartheid-era South Africa. Even some staunch Israeli critics of the occupation have argued that discrimination against Palestinians does not amount to intentional or institutional racism and is the result of genuine security fears. Clash over wordsThis clash over words -- and the efforts to make them stick -- have increasingly come to characterize perceptions of the conflict from within the region and abroad.  While the Israeli government response to the previous B'Tselem and HRW reports was critical, Haiat acknowledged concerns that the apartheid narrative is building, prompting a more combative approach this time. ""Of course, there is a concern that people will believe those false accusations,"" Haiat said. He pointed to Israel's current government, which for the first time includes Arab lawmakers in its ranks as proof of what he termed Israel's inclusive democracy.  But many Palestinian activists believe those arguments are no longer cutting through, and the see the tide of public opinion turning in their favor. Israel announces plan to double Golan Heights population, drawing condemnation from SyriaThey point to demonstrations in the United States and around the world last year in support of Palestinian families facing the threat of forced eviction from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. ""The world is coming to the conclusion that for human beings that live in the land between the river and the sea, the levels of freedoms and rights are defined by ethnonational identity,"" Salem Barahmeh, Executive Director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy told CNN.The charge of anti-Semitism by Israel's defenders has also become a highly contested issue. While research clearly points to rising anti-Semitism around the world, many feel the word is being mis-used and devalued. Israel's former ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, was ridiculed recently after accusing actress Emma Watson of anti-Semitism after she posted online a picture of a pro-Palestinian rally alongside the words, ""Solidarity is a verb."" ""No joke, we are at the point where merely posting a vague picture referencing solidarity with Palestinians on Instagram gets you labeled as an antisemite,"" MSNBC host and former CNN journalist Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted.  At the level of international diplomacy, though, there is little sign so far that the battle over the apartheid label is having much of an impact.  On Tuesday, the US pushed back at the Amnesty report's characterization of Israel.  US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a briefing that the department ""(rejects) the view that Israel's actions constitute apartheid."" ""We certainly reject the label that has been attached to this (report),"" Price said, adding: ""We think that it is important as the world's only Jewish state that the Jewish people must not be denied their right to self-determination and we must ensure there isn't a double standard being applied.""US, UAE intercepts ballistic missile during Israeli President's visitThe report also coincided with the first ever trip by an Israeli head of state to the United Arab Emirates -- underscoring Israel's recent diplomatic achievements.

Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani became the first Gulf Arab leader to visit the Biden White House on Monday. It's a trip that underscores the tiny state's unrelenting ambition to remain a key international player and its ability to walk back from the brink five years after a regional embargo risked turning it into a Middle East backwater.  In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut off diplomatic and economic ties with Doha, accusing it of cozying up to their adversaries including Islamist groups and Iran. Then-President Donald Trump appeared to take credit for the move, and it seemed as though it was only a matter of time before Doha caved, with its regional clout diminished.  But Qatar persevered, and its fortunes have now seemingly turned. It will be the third Gulf country after Kuwait and Bahrain to be designated the title of major non-NATO ally, granted to close friends that have strategic working relationships with the US military. ""I think it's long overdue,"" Biden said.  Ironically, the very policies Qatar was demonized for by its neighbors may have been what catapulted it back into the international limelight.  Read MoreIn 2020, Qatar brokered Washington's talks with the Taliban, a fruit of the decades long, often controversial ties it maintained with the extremist group. Those talks served as a precursor to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Doha also cushioned the botched exit last year by facilitating evacuations and became a hub for travel to Kabul.  Doha's cordial ties with Tehran also appear to have paid off. As Iran and the US arrive at a critical juncture in negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, Doha seems to be engaging in shuttle diplomacy. Sheikh Tamim's visit to Washington comes just days after his top diplomat visited Tehran. It's unclear if the emir was carrying a message. Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of liquified natural gas, is also playing a role in another global flashpoint offering to help with contingency planning in case of disruptions to energy supplies in Europe should Russia invade Ukraine.  The contrast between the Biden and Trump administrations' view of the Gulf couldn't be starker. Trump made history by picking Saudi Arabia for his first overseas trip and his family forged close ties with de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. A year into his presidency, Biden is yet to have a phone call with the prince.  The digest  UAE to introduce corporate tax rate The United Arab Emirates is introducing its first ever federal corporate tax on business profits in June 2023, as the country seeks to realign with newly introduced global taxation standards. The standard statutory tax rate will be 9%, but 0% on profits up to Dh375,000 ($102,000) ""to support small businesses and startups"". Background: The Gulf oil exporter had previously only imposed corporate tax on oil companies and banks. In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) introduced a deal, agreed by 136 countries -- including the UAE -- that ensured multinational enterprises worldwide will become subject to a minimum 15% tax rate from 2023. Why it matters: The UAE has long benefited from its tax-free status to carve out a role as an international commercial, energy and tourism hub. The move will be seen as its first step to committing to the OECD target.  US says Iran talks entering 'final stretch' It's time for the US and Iran to start making tough political decisions as talks on a nuclear agreement enter the ""final stretch,"" a senior State Department official said Monday. Some of the most critical decisions are yet to be made, he said.Background: A landmark deal was reached between the two countries in 2015 aimed at reining in Iran's nuclear program. The Trump administration pulled out of the deal in 2018; President Biden has promised to reenter the deal, but a conclusive agreement has not yet been reached.Why it matters: This could be the closest the two sides have been to reaching a new deal, and only a handful of weeks remain to conclude it, considering Iran's pace of nuclear production, said the US official. UAE intercepts Houthi missile during Israeli president's visit The United Arab Emirates blocked a Houthi missile attack, intercepting the projectile and destroying it on Monday. The third such attack in the last fortnight came during Israeli President Isaac Herzog's first visit to the Gulf state.Background: Monday's attempted strike comes after a drone attack on Abu Dhabi which killed three foreign workers, along with another foiled missile attack. All three were claimed by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are fighting a Saudi-led coalition. Why it matters: Life has continued as normal in the UAE since the assaults began, but repeated strikes could quell expat appetite to stay in the country.

This time, however, female spectators were allowed to attend for the first time in three years.  About 2,000 women watched the qualifying match at Tehran's Azadi stadium, only the second time for women to attend a major game since the 1979 Islamic revolution. They were seated in a female-only section and entered through a designated area. The move found support from none other than Ahmad Khomeini, the great grandson of the founder of the Islamic regime that banned female spectators from sporting events.

Iran is the only country in the world to ban women from attending football and other sports in stadiums, according to Human Rights Watch. The issue remains a hot topic in the country and was the subject of the 2006 Iranian film Offside, which follows a group of girls as they dress up like boys to attend soccer matches.

They attacked houses, shops and cars,"" Huwwara's mayor, Mueen Al Dmeidi, told CNN.Israeli settlement plans in the West Bank draw condemnation from US, UK, EuropeThe Israeli military confirmed the incident on Monday, saying in a statement that a confrontation broke out between Israelis and Palestinians in the village of Huwwara, south of Nablus.Read More""The confrontation began when a number of Israeli civilians drove into the village and threw stones, causing significant damage to businesses and vehicles,"" according to the military statement.Images provided to CNN by local residents show damaged cars in the Palestinian town of Huwwara on Monday.One widely circulated video shows two men apparently throwing rocks at a parked car, before they get back into their own car and rejoin the convoy.A 17-year old Palestinian was injured, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa, with other reports suggesting that at least three people suffered injuries.The incident prompted Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz to promise tough action against what he called ""nationalistically motivated violence.""In a Monday statement, Gantz said than anyone who throws rocks or sets cars aflame ""is a terrorist and will be treated as such.""Israeli man killed in West Bank after shooting attack on car He went on: ""I have recently initiated several meetings to discuss this issue, and we currently find ourselves at the height of the process to strengthen our troops on the ground, to build forces with the police and (the internal intelligence agency), and to determine operational and legal proceedings vis-a-vis such incidents.""Israeli officials have made similar statements vowing to take action against settler attacks in recent months, but rights groups say the army does not often intervene. For its part, the army says it is committed to the security of all residents in relevant areas.An Israeli police spokesperson told CNN that there had been no arrests relating to the incident but said the matter was still under investigation. Palestinian mayor of Huwwara, Al Dmeidi, told CNN he was skeptical any perpetrators would be punished.""Imagine if the opposite had happened and it was Palestinians who had attacked Israelis,"" he said, adding: ""A massacre would have been carried out against Palestinians. You would have seen dead Palestinians, while the whole world would have spoken about the poor Israeli victims.""The incident in Huwwara comes just days after settlers attacked a group of Israeli peace activists on Friday in the nearby West Bank village of Burin.In that incident, which was also captured on video and widely shared, a group of about a dozen masked settlers attacked a group of Israeli anti-occupation activists and Palestinians with stones and clubs, setting fire to one of their cars.The Palestinian Red Crescent said 10 of the activists, who had been helping Palestinian farmers to plant trees, had been injured in the attack.CNN's Mike Schwartz contributed to this report."
meast,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/middleeast/isis-syria-prison-attack-intl/index.html,US-backed Kurdish forces recapture Syrian prison days after ISIS attack,"By Hamdi Alkhshali, Kareem Khadder and Eliza Mackintosh, CNN"," (CNN)US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) regained control of a prison in northeast Syria where ISIS fighters launched an attack last week, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led alliance said Wednesday. After nearly a week of fighting and US-led coalition airstrikes, the siege -- believed to be the biggest coordinated attack by ISIS since the fall of its so-called caliphate nearly three years ago -- finally came to an end.The attack on the prison has stoked fears the terror group, which has flown largely under the radar since losing its territory in Iraq and Syria, could be making a resurgence. The SDF's media commander, Siyamend Ali, told CNN that the attack had been coordinated and planned over the course of six months. ""This operation is one of the largest targeted operations that Da'esh (ISIS) executed,"" Ali said. ""According to the detainees who we interrogated at the first moments of the operation, the operation was prepared and planned for six months.""More than 100 ISIS fighters launched the assault on Ghweran prison in Hasakah on Thursday, detonating three car bombs before storming into the complex in an attempt to break out thousands of their comrades, many of whom were detained after the group's 2019 defeat.A Humvee patrols in Hasakah, northeast Syria, on Monday amid ongoing clashes between US-backed Kurdish forces and ISIS.Read MoreThe SDF, which oversee Ghweran prison, said the ISIS fighters struck local forces standing guard outside, while the militants inside burned blankets and plastic items ""in an attempt to create chaos."" The Kurdish-led forces, a key US partner in the fight against ISIS, said they ""thwarted"" the attempted jailbreak hours after it began. However, clashes were still ongoing near the facility until Wednesday, when the group's spokesman, Farhad Shami, said that all ISIS fighters and prisoners had surrendered.There was ""mass surrendering of ISIS prisoners,"" Shami added.He also shared videos on Twitter which appeared to show hundreds of prisoners in orange jumpsuits gathered in a courtyard, with the walls behind them blackened from the fighting. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that the US-led coalition had moved in armored Bradley fighting vehicles to support the SDF, indicating that US ground forces were involved in the fight. The Bradleys were being used to help establish an inner and an outer perimeter around the prison facility, while the SDF closed in on ISIS fighters, according to US military officials.""We have provided limited ground support, strategically positioned to assist security in the area,"" John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters in Washington.  This photo provided by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces shows some ISIS fighters who were arrested.Coalition forces also supported the operation with airstrikes, including the precision targeting of ISIS fighters who were attacking SDF positions from the cover of nearby buildings.No US service members were injured during the fighting, a defense official said, although the SDF suffered some losses. Dozens of fighters with the SDF and ISIS are estimated to have been killed in the fighting.Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), the US-led coalition mission to defeat ISIS, said in a statement Tuesday that the recent ISIS escape attempt ""will not pose a significant threat to Iraq or the region."" It added that assessments are ongoing to see if ISIS is planning any future attacks on Ghweran or other prison facilities throughout Syria or Iraq.""Due to its severely degraded capability, Daesh's future survival is dependent on its ability to refill its ranks through poorly-conceived attempts like the Hasakah attack,"" said Maj. Gen. John W. Brennan, Jr., the commander of the OIR Combined Joint Task Force.Some 11,000 to 12,000 ISIS fighters are held in northern Syria in prisons and detention camps run by the SDF. Deadly ISIS prison break attempt fuels fears of the group's resurgenceWhile this is not the first such prison break attempt -- several escaped from the same facility in 2020 by ripping off doors and using them to destroy a wall -- concerns are mounting that the timing and audacity of the attack may indicate the terror group's renewed strength.Although there is little fear that ISIS will reclaim its former physical territory, which, at its peak, stretched from the outskirts of Baghdad to western Syria and encompassed more than 10 million people, the terror group has been mobilizing thousands of its remaining fighters in recent years. In 2019, just as US-backed forces retook the final ISIS stronghold in Syria, and only a year after Iraq declared victory against the group, intelligence sources and international monitors were already noticing an increase in ISIS activity and attacks in the region.A wide-ranging report released in 2020 by the UN Monitoring Team, which tracks the global jihadi terror threat, warned that ISIS was beginning to reassert itself in Iraq and Syria. It said the group was ""mounting increasingly bold insurgent attacks, calling and planning for the breakout of ISIL [ISIS] fighters in detention facilities and exploiting weaknesses in the security environment of both countries.""In recent months, Iraqi security forces and commanders have also warned that ISIS sleeper cells are continuing to stage attacks.Following a deadly ambush on an Iraqi military post near Baghdad last Friday, Iraqi President Barham Salih tweeted: ""Certainly, the attempts to revive terrorism in the region cannot be underestimated.""CNN's Oren Liebermann, Ellie Kaufman, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Joshua Berlinger contributed to this report."

This is the first firing by the US of Patriot missiles since April 2003, according to CENTCOM. ""The combined efforts successfully prevented both missiles from impacting the base. There were no U.S. casualties,"" CENTCOM said.The attack was the second in a week aimed at the UAE, which is a member of the Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels for years, and marked a significant escalation in tensions. The UAE has largely avoided the firing line, with Houthis opting instead to strike Saudi Arabia, which borders Yemen.CNN reported earlier that the UAE intercepted two ballistic missiles launched by Houthis early Monday, in what the Iran-backed group warned would be part of a continuous campaign to target the Emirati capital.Read MoreAt 4:15 a.m. Abu Dhabi's skyline lit up with what witnesses described as ""fireballs in the sky."" Some of the capital's residents woke to the sound of explosions as air defense missiles intercepted the projectiles. The incident comes a week after a Houthi drone and missile attack near Abu Dhabi's airport killed three foreign workers and injured several others.  In a statement Monday, the UAE Ministry of Defense said, ""its air defense has intercepted and destroyed two ballistic missiles fired by the terrorist Houthi group.""""The attack did not result in any casualties, as the remnants of the intercepted and destroyed ballistic missiles fell in separate areas around the Emirate of Abu Dhabi,"" the statement added.A drone attack in Abu Dhabi could mark a dangerous turning point for the Middle East. Here's what to knowThe ministry said it is ""ready to deal with any threats, and that it takes all necessary measures to protect the state from all attacks.""Several flights were delayed arriving into Abu Dhabi airport, according to the airport's website. Flight tracking website Flightradar24 showed Abu Dhabi-bound planes flying in circles near the airport. The US embassy in Abu Dhabi also called on US citizens in the UAE to maintain a ""high level of security awareness,"" issuing a series of instructions on how to respond to a missile attack. Shortly after Monday's incident in Abu Dhabi, the UAE's Ministry of Defense said an F-16 fighter jet had destroyed the ballistic missile launcher used to target the UAE capital. It did not specify what country the aircraft belonged to. Yemen's Houthis claimed they were targeting the UAE's commercial hub of Dubai as well as Abu Dhabi's Al Dhafra airbase, which hosts the United States Air Force's 380th Air Expeditionary Wing. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree on Monday warned that the group would ""expand their operations over the next phase."" ""We are calling on foreign companies and investors to leave the UAE,"" Saree said in a video statement. ""It is subject to continuous targeting."" Abu Dhabi has repeatedly been ranked one of the safest cities in the world, with the January 17 strike considered ""unprecedented"" by Emirati officials. For decades, the UAE staved off turbulence in the crisis-ridden region, attracting millions of expatriates and large volumes of foreign investment. The country's economy relies heavily on a foreign workforce. An escalation in week-long violenceYemen's Houthis had vowed to retaliate for a series of deadly airstrikes over the last week by the Saudi-led coalition -- of which the UAE is a major partner -- in northern Yemen which killed scores of people. The airstrikes also knocked out the internet nationwide after hitting a telecommunications tower. A nation-wide internet outage entered its fourth day in Yemen on Monday, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks. On Friday, at least 70 people were killed in an airstrike on a detention center in the Yemeni city of Saada, according to international aid groups. The Saudi-led coalition denied it deliberately targeted the detention center, with its spokesman Brig. Gen. Turki Al-Maliki calling the claims ""baseless and unfounded,"" according to Saudi state news agency SPA.The coalition did say it had hit Hodeidah, taking down ""one of the [Houthis'] dens of maritime piracy and organized crime."" The coalition also said it attacked ""military targets"" in Sanaa. Last week's offensive began after last Monday's attack in Abu Dhabi. The United Nations Security Council last Friday unanimously condemned the January 17 strike in the UAE capital. The UAE is a major coalition partner that has been fighting in a six-year Saudi-led military campaign to crush the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, which control much of Yemen. The offensive began in 2015 to restore Yemen's internationally recognized government, after it was ousted by the Houthis. The coalition has intensified its attacks in the war-torn nation in the wake of the Houthi missile and drone strike in Abu Dhabi last week. In 2019, the UAE pulled most of its troops from Yemen, after privately deeming the war unwinnable. The campaign failed to crush the rebels but exacted a huge humanitarian toll, with thousands of Yemenis dead and malnourishment and disease widespread.More recently, the UAE has returned to the conflict, backing Yemeni groups in flashpoints like the oil-rich provinces of Shabwa and Marib.Correction: A previous version of this article quoted a US senior defense official who had incorrectly stated the last time Patriot missiles were fired. It was in April 2003."

He called on all members of his Future Movement party, which make up the country's largest Sunni parliamentary bloc, to do the same.Hariri said that neither he nor any members of his party would run for parliamentary elections, scheduled for May 2022.Hariri leaves a vacuum in Sunni leadership, in a country with a delicate confessional power-sharing system that hangs in the balance. Multiple local media outlets have reported that Hariri's allies and foes have tried to talk him out of the move.Lebanon is in the throes of a financial tailspin, exacerbated by a series of political stalemates centered on corruption, confessional power-sharing disputes and the the question of Iran-backed Hezbollah's arms.

With little political experience, he took on the mantle of Sunni leadership. What followed was a period rife with violence, including a war with Israel and a string of political assassinations -- as well as economic crises.  Hariri was backed by Saudi Arabia for most of his political career. His political allegiances pitted him against the militant and political group Hezbollah, in a rivalry that shaped Lebanon's political scene for nearly two decades. In 2017, Riyadh unofficially withdrew support for Hariri.In November 2017, Saudi Arabia temporarily detained the prime minister and had him resign under duress, according to multiple sources, Hariri since returned to the premiership but, without Riyadh's patronage, saw a steady decline in his political power. In October 2019, a popular uprising against Lebanon's political establishment toppled his third government.At the close of his speech on Monday, a visibly emotional Hariri cited his father's resignation speech just before his assassination. ""Finally, the best words for this moment are what Rafik Hariri said in his statement of absention 17 years ago. 'I entrust to God the Almighty this beloved country Lebanon and its kind people,"" said Hariri, choking on tears. ""And I express my heartfelt thanks to all of those who cooperated with me during this last period.'"""

Yet that front-row view of West's meteoric rise in the first two parts of this docu-trilogy then gives way to the public figure, whose quirks, contradictions and headline-making actions complicate and muddy that narrative arc.In the broadest terms, there's something fascinating about this Netflix presentation, which had its roots in Clarence ""Coodie"" Simmons identifying West's potential in 1998, while hosting a public-access show in Chicago.Within a few years, Simmons had essentially become West's videographer and companion, chronicling the ups and downs of his efforts to win the respect of Roc-a-Fella Records and launch a solo career.It's an unusually intimate portrait, following West to shows, into the studio, during his recovery from a car accident, and as he hangs out with his late mom, Donda. ""He plays tracks like Michael Jordan shoots free throws,"" Donda says.That also includes a who's-who of cameos by those who crossed his path, from Mos Def to Pharrell Williams, Jamie Foxx to Jay-Z.Read MoreAlong the way, Simmons -- who narrates the docuseries, and shares directing credit with Chike Ozah -- details his own journey, which included becoming a father and giving up the project at West's request, before returning years later and eventually putting it together as hands were idled by Covid.""Every great story begins with a vision,"" Simmons notes near the outset, and clearly, West saw himself as a major presence before he had the resume to back that up, then delivered on those promises.

At one point he chooses to turn off the camera as West embarks on an extended rant, saying that he at times found it difficult watching him on TV, ""knowing he had issues with his mental health.""Part three reflects that tension, offering rapid-fire glimpses of West controversies. In the process, ""A Kanye Trilogy"" shifts from the leisurely pace employed during his hungry years -- letting long conversations and exchanges play out -- to fast-forwarding through what's unfolded since he achieved stardom. (For those wondering, West's estranged wife, Kim Kardashian, is glimpsed briefly, but not in a significant way.)At more than 4 ½ hours over its three parts -- subtitled ""Vision,"" ""Purpose"" and ""Awakening"" -- ""jeen-yuhs"" is already the equivalent of a director's cut. Yet the film has value as what plays like a sort-of real-life version of ""A Star is Born,"" including the familiar notion that artistic genius comes at a cost.""I knew he was destined for greatness,"" Simmons says, and West's road to that pinnacle is first remarkable, then uneven once he achieved stardom. As the filmmaker says, ""A Kanye Trilogy"" could have -- and just in terms of presenting a more cohesive story, probably should have -- ended there.""jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy"" premieres Feb. 16 on Netflix."

The Orange County Medical Examiner's Office determined that his death was accidental, most likely due to him falling backward and striking his head. Autopsy report says Bob Saget had Covid-19 and died as a result of blunt head traumaOn Tuesday, Saget's widow Kelly Rizzo and her three daughters filed a lawsuit against Orange County's sheriff and the medical examiner's office, requesting that some investigation records related to the death be exempt from being revealed publicly because of their graphic nature in how they portray the late actor. ""In the process of these investigations, Defendants created records which include photographs, video recordings, audio recordings, statutorily protected autopsy information, and all other statutorily protected information,"" the lawsuit stated. ""Upon information and belief, some of these Records graphically depict Mr. Saget, his likeness or features, or parts of him, and were made by Defendants during Defendants' investigations."" Read MoreThe family argues in the lawsuit that the release of this information -- whether through a public records request or any other avenue -- would cause them to ""suffer irreparable harm in the form of extreme mental pain, anguish, and emotional distress.""In court documents obtained by CNN affiliate WESH, Ninth Circuit Court Judge Vincent Chiu agreed and granted the motion.Brian Bieber, a Saget family attorney, told CNN that the injunction was filed to ""prevent disclosure of any photographs or videos of Mr. Saget made by the authorities during their investigation."" ""The facts of the investigation should be made public, but these materials should remain private out of respect for the dignity of Mr. Saget and his family.

Director Joel Souza was also injured in the shooting which occurred when Baldwin practiced a draw with a revolver and fired the weapon.The lawsuit, filed in Santa Fe, alleges numerous industry standard violations by Baldwin and others charged with safety on the set, attorney Brian Panish announced in a news conference Tuesday.The lawsuit claims the production companies and producers ""cut corners"" and ""chose to hire the cheapest crew available,"" specifically noting that they ""knowingly hired a wholly unqualified armorer,"" and required her to split time in a second role as assistant props master.""We continue to cooperate with the authorities to determine how live ammunition arrived on the 'Rust' set in the first place. Any claim that Alec was reckless is entirely false. He, Halyna and the rest of the crew relied on the statement by the two professionals responsible for checking the gun that it was a 'cold gun' -- meaning there is no possibility of a discharge, blank or otherwise,"" Aaron Dyer, attorney for Baldwin and other producers of ""Rust,"" said in a statement to CNN. ""This protocol has worked on thousands of films, with millions of discharges, as there has never before been an incident on a set where an actual bullet harmed anyone.""Read MoreBoth armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed and prop master Sarah Zachry are named in the lawsuit, along with assistant director Dave Halls, who, according to a previously filed affidavit, handed the gun to Baldwin just prior to the shooting.

Hutchins -- wearing a pair of headphones over a tan hat, with a puffy jacket -- is seen to the right of the film camera, with Alec Baldwin in the background.  It's unclear from Svetnoy's Facebook post when the photo was actually taken.
During an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos late last year, Baldwin said he and Hutchins were going over how she wanted to position his hand before the gun went off, saying then, ""I would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger.""""The gun was supposed to be empty; I was told I was handed an empty gun,"" Baldwin said in the interview. ""There's only one question to be resolved ... only one. And that is, where did the live round come from?""Two crew members have told CNN that Gutierrez Reed mishandled weapons on a previous film project. She did not reply to CNN's request for comment regarding those allegations. Gutierrez Reed is now suing the movie's gun and ammunition supplier, accusing them of mixing up dummy rounds with live ammunition.Safety concerns raised by the crew remained unaddressed, the lawsuit states, citing 15 specific safety protocols they allege were violated, including the use of a real gun instead of a dummy weapon, use of live ammunition on set, and improper storage.""There are regulations and guidelines in place today that should prevent something like this from happening, but they need to be enforced,"" Panish said. ""Had they been followed, this never would have happened.""Panish, who represents Hutchins' husband and young son, also showed a nearly 10-minute video that included a short, highly-produced, animated reenactment of the shooting that led to the ""senseless and tragic death of Halyna Hutchins."" The details of the reenactment are based on ""factual allegations in the complaint made by the Hutchins Family,"" according to a slate at the beginning of the video.CNN has also reached out to Halls, Gutierrez Reed, Zachry, and the 'Rust' production company for comment.CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report."

Yet too many of this year's commercials seemed to enlist celebrities -- or gangs of celebrities -- with no clear idea of what to do with them, and in several instances failing to trade off that for which they're famous.You had the money to hire Zendaya, Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman, Dolly Parton, Kevin Hart, Idris Elba, and Lindsay Lohan? Cool. Now give them something memorable to do, other than just serving as a mouthpiece for the product.On the flip side, Larry David was used brilliantly as a curmudgeon through history in a spot for a product it was hard to imagine him actually endorsing. Seriously, crypto? Pretty, pretty bad.Those were just a few of the takeaways absorbing the usual smorgasbord of football, ads, patriotism and self-promotion, not necessarily in that order. And while Covid was part of the day (including an ad for a home-testing kit), the game felt closer to normal.So, who scored, and who fumbled, in making the most of their exposure during the big game?

But as this telecast happened to come during the Winter Olympics -- 42 years after Michaels' famous ""Miracle on Ice"" call at Lake Placid -- it felt like an exclamation point on his remarkable longevity as a play-by-play man. ""The Rams were built to win the Super Bowl, and they have sealed the deal,"" Michaels said once it was decided.Chevy Silverado: The rare reunion that worked, with a tagline really drove home this ""The Sopranos""-inspired spot featuring TV siblings Jamie Lynn-Sigler and Robert Iler: ""A whole new truck for a whole new generation.""Toyota: The auto maker delivered a mini movie about paralympic champion Brian McKeever and his brother, a nifty pairing of heart-tugging uplift to coincide with the Olympics, and balanced that with a humorous keeping-up-with-the-Joneses ad.Etrade: Nobody ever went wrong with talking babies.Verizon: Tapping Jim Carrey in his ""The Cable Guy"" persona represented a very savvy blend of talent, nostalgia and product.Los Angeles tourism: An 80-plus-degree day in February, with all those stereotypical cutaway shots of the beach, Griffith Park Observatory and movie stars?

But most of these were just plain weird.Electric-car ads: There were too many of them, and most seemed to be trying too hard, with the notable exception of BMW's spot featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Salma Hayek as Zeus and Hera, which at least had an organic electric tie-in.Movie theaters: After two painful years during the pandemic, the cumulative message of ads for upcoming hoped-for blockbusters — ""Jurassic Park: Dominion,"" Jordan Peele's ""Nope,"" and throw in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" during the pregame show -- is come share these movies with crowds. But there were relatively few of them, in what could have been a much bigger push for the spring summer movie-going season.Dwayne Johnson: While it was nice to see what looked like his audition to replace ring announcer Michael Buffer introducing the game, it felt A) like he might finally be taking acting tips from Vin Diesel and B) as if the star is a trifle overexposed.Coinbase: OK, get the idea of flashing the QR code.

entertainment,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/entertainment/bel-air-review/index.html,'Bel-Air' takes 'The Fresh Prince' down a dark path that's better than it has any right to be,"Review by Brian Lowry, CNN"," (CNN)Nobody asked for a dark, dramatic reimagining of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" which makes the new series fitting that description, ""Bel-Air,"" better than it has any right to be. Premiering Super Bowl Sunday on NBC's streaming service Peacock, the opening episodes establish a catchy beat, with the main question being how long they can sustain it.Inspired by a 2019 fan-made trailer that went viral (and whose creator, Morgan Cooper, is a director, producer and co-writer here), the series could easily have become a classic case of taking a three-minute gag too far. Yet the creative team under showrunners T.J. Brady and Rasheed Newson blows up the opening credits of the original sitcom -- which explained how the character came to live with his wealthy relatives -- in a very clever way.Will Smith (Jabari Banks) has a bright future, with a looming basketball scholarship that will take him out of Philadelphia and put him on a path to bigger and better things. But an encounter with a gang member goes wrong, and his hubris leads him to try settling matters on the playground, a plan that backfires in a dangerous manner.Understandably concerned, Will's mom (April Parker Jones) ships him off to Los Angeles and relatives he barely knows, as evidenced by his stunned expression when he first catches sight of their gated mansion. ""You did not tell me that your family was White,"" the driver (Jordan L. Jones) says.Still, fitting in isn't sitcom-easy in this telling, with Will's arrival provoking jealousy from his cousin Carlton (Olly Sholotan), who's hiding his own secret, and tensions involving his Aunt Vivian (Cassandra Freeman) and Uncle Philip (Adrian Holmes) -- the latter in the midst of a race to become District Attorney, but facing questions about street cred due to his zip code.Read MoreAs constructed, there's a strain of ""Gossip Girl"" running through ""Bel-Air's"" DNA, given the power dynamics at the posh private school the kids attend. The show also explores racial politics, with Will responding angrily when one of Carlton's White friends sings provocative rap lyrics, an objection that Carlton dismisses.Already the recipient of a two-season order, no one can accuse the new series of moving too slowly; rather, the writers race through soap-opera-ish plot developments in the first three episodes, provoking skepticism about whether the producers have frontloaded the action a little too much.That, too, underscores the difference between ""The Fresh Prince"" -- introduced on a broadcast network more than 30 years ago, and celebrated in a 2020 reunion special -- and ""Bel-Air,"" situated on a streaming service where the game is to burn brightly and garner attention.Promoting the show during the Super Bowl might not be the ideal juxtaposition for a dark drama, but in terms of percentages, if the series can hook a tiny fraction of those viewers the bet will pay off for Peacock.While it's possible to second-guess that strategy, in terms of delivering a show improbably worthy of such pricey TV real estate, ""Bel-Air"" has held up its end of the bargain.""Bel-Air"" premieres Feb. 13 on Peacock."

entertainment,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/entertainment/marry-me-review/index.html,'Marry Me' shines the spotlight on Jennifer Lopez in a 'meet dumb' rom-com,"Review by Brian Lowry, CNN"," (CNN)Designed to showcase Jennifer Lopez playing a character that could hardly be called a reach, ""Marry Me"" trades in the ""meet cute"" rom-com formula for ""meet dumb."" Lopez still gets ample opportunities to sing a hummable soundtrack, but even within the genre's parameters, the silly premise deals the movie a blow from which it never entirely recovers.The fascination with Lopez's personal life -- and her romantic history with other famous folk -- sometimes overshadows her talents, which is an underlying theme in this film that she also produced. Her return to this territory will surely represent a cause for Valentine's Day celebration in some quarters, after past entries like ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""Maid in Manhattan.""That said, the set-up feels especially strained, even before you get to the ""Notting Hill""-like notion of the special challenges when an ordinary guy becomes involved with a glamorous entertainer. In a movie that hinges on an impulsive decision, it's hard not to wish somebody had spent at least a little more time agonizing about the script, which is actually based on a graphic novel.Lopez's Kat Valdez is on top of the world, about to marry fellow musical superstar Bastian (played by singer Maluma) during a televised concert. The made-for-TV nuptials will serve the dual purpose of promoting their single ""Marry Me,"" illustrating how she leads her life completely in the public eye.Confronted by the news that Bastian cheated on her, she decides to take what she later describes as ""a leap of faith"" by proceeding with the wedding ceremony by plucking a divorced math teacher, Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson), out of the crowd.Read MoreJennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson in 'Marry Me.'It is, as she acknowledges, an ""insane situation,"" one that her loyal manager (""Game of Thrones'"" John Bradley) is eager to make go away. But of course, the plot calls for Kat and Charlie to try maintaining the pretense of a connection a few months for face-saving purposes, just long enough for the pop princess and public-school proctor to begin appreciating each other's qualities, with the threat that she might reconcile with Bastian looming over the nascent relationship.A nice guy and a single dad, Charlie is quick to admit that ""I don't fit"" in Kat's under-the-spotlight sphere, which hinges to an unhealthy degree on live streams and followers. The Universal release also goes out of its way to synergistically incorporate sister NBC properties, with ""Today's"" Hoda Kotb and ""The Tonight Show's"" Jimmy Fallon receiving nearly as much screen time as any of the supporting players except perhaps Bradley and Sarah Silverman as Charlie's friend and coworker.Marking the feature debut for TV director Kat Coiro (""Dead to Me"" and the upcoming ""She-Hulk""), ""Marry Me"" conjures a few sweet moments, lots of music, and a ""King for a Day"" quality in Charlie's plight, with Kat's jet-setting lifestyle and paparazzi suddenly stalking his every move.A genre reborn: Inside the evolution of the rom-comYet while the movie is unabashed about its rom-com roots, such fare isn't exactly rare these days, having simply migrated from theaters to venues like Netflix, which seems to churn them out in bunches. (Notably, the movie will premiere simultaneously on NBC's streaming service Peacock as well as theaters.)Admittedly, the mere union of Lopez and this light-hearted premise will be enough to prompt some to say, ""I do."" Strictly on its merits, though, ""Marry Me"" is the kind of generic offer all but the most hopeless romantics can afford to refuse.""Marry Me"" premieres Feb. 11 in US theaters and on Peacock. It's rated PG-13."
entertainment,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/entertainment/book-of-boba-fett-finale-review/index.html,"'The Book of Boba Fett' ends a chapter, while setting up 'The Mandalorian's' next one","Review by Brian Lowry, CNN","The following contains spoilers about ""The Book of Boba Fett"" finale. (CNN)With the benefit of hindsight, ""The Book of Boba Fett"" was part epilogue, a whole lot of prologue, and one giant valentine to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, attempting to put a different spin on peripheral players and underdeveloped life forms.That was a lot (indeed, a bit too much) to juggle, as became clear when the series took an abrupt turn back into what felt more like a third season of ""The Mandalorian"" in the midst of its seven-episode run. Boba Fett might have great armor, but as characters go, the series exposed a rather hollow shell.Still, series creator Jon Favreau and collaborators Dave Filoni and Robert Rodriguez clearly had plenty of action figures with which they wanted to play, all while maneuvering to reunite the central duo from ""The Mandalorian.""The action-packed finale included a protracted showdown between Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) and his ragtag roster of allies against the criminal Pyke syndicate, which not only had them outnumbered but seemingly outflanked. The ensuing battle -- in the season's longest installment -- contained numerous last-minute rescues and an old-style western gunfight, pitting Boba against the bounty hunter Cad Bane (again voiced by Corey Burton), another fan favorites imported from the ""Star Wars"" animated universe, which planted fertile seeds for the live-action fare.One recurring theme in ""Book of Boba Fett"" sought to showcase residents of Tatooine that played minor roles in the original trilogy in a different light. Here, that included Boba's (somewhat) tamed Rancor monster joining in the final battle, which followed the more sympathetic view of the Tuskens during Boba's time with them in earlier episodes.Read MoreDespite rousing moments the series couldn't entirely overcome its awkward structure, which underscored that ""Boba Fett"" existed as an offshoot of ""The Mandalorian."" The final episodes thus went about the task of bringing that title character back together with Grogu, a.k.a. Baby Yoda, after he had found a new home and destiny under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker. (An encore appearance by Mark Hamill, along with Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka Tano, elevated ""fan service"" to almost giddy extremes.)While that term is usually evoked derisively, Favreau and Filoni have embraced the idea of giving the audience what it wants -- less out of a sense of obligation than because that's what they want to see too.That said, after the crescendo of that Luke cameo at the end of season two, one suspects the reunion was motivated at least in part by Disney's desire to ensure that it can keep peddling ""Baby Yoda"" merchandise. Overall, ""Book of Boba Fett"" represented an interesting if not wholly successful experiment, adding pieces to a ""Star Wars"" live-action arsenal for Disney+ that can now look forward to eagerly anticipated series featuring Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka -- characters with more heft than Boba Fett ultimately brought to the party.Given the tone of these shows, think of this as a very expensive ""B"" western. As for those who might have been skeptical whether Boba Fett, given his limited screen time through the years, could sustain his own program, the way ""The Book of Boba Fett"" unfolded, for better and worse, basically rendered that question moot."

""My brother would never do something like that, but I'm still guilty by association. That's what they call it, right?"" Janet said. ""He didn't have that in him.""'Janet Jackson' tells the singer's story, but it's clear who's in controlShe also said that although her brother made a monetary settlement with the boy's family, it was not an admission of guilt. ""He just wanted it to go away, but (the payout) looks like you're guilty,"" she said.Read MoreIn the second hour, Jackson spoke about the 2004 incident in which Justin Timberlake ripped off part of her top at the end of their Super Bowl halftime performance, exposing her breast. ""We talked once, and he said, 'I don't know if I should come out and make a statement,'"" she said. ""I said, 'Listen, I don't want any drama for you. They're aiming all of this at me.' So I just said if I were you, I wouldn't say anything.""Jackson said that she experienced backlash not just from fans but professionally.

Her boyfriend at the time, Jermaine Dupri, spoke on camera about that time period and said that he ultimately stepped away from his duties on the Grammys' board because, ""I felt like they were disrespectful to Janet, and I resigned at that point.""

Shonda Rhimes caught lightning in a bottle for Netflix with ""Bridgerton,"" but her latest creation is less likely to have tongues wagging.Rhimes has populated the show with a number of familiar faces from her ABC/""Scandal"" days, but the marquee parts go to Julia Garner (""Ozark""), sporting an accent seemingly patterned after Balki in ""Perfect Strangers,"" and Anna Chlumsky (""Veep""). Even if Garner's character, Anna Delvey, actually sounded this way, listening to it for nine episodes borders on becoming a distraction at best, and an ear-bending ordeal at worst.While taking liberties with the story, the underlying bones of it are pretty sensational: Delvey, a ""fake heiress,"" beguiled the Manhattan elite and banks alike, worming her way into high society before the walls came crashing down and landed her in a courtroom.Julia Garner as Anna Delvery in 'Inventing Anna' (David Giesbrecht/Netflix).Delvey lived the good life, creating an image that fooled plenty of people and left many reluctant to discuss their relationships with her. That included running up expenses like a $62,000 trip to Morocco, with a friend (played by ""Scandal's"" Katie Lowes) holding the bill.Anna's story was a tough one to crack, due in part to the reticence of those she fooled. Enter Chlumsy's Vivian, who doggedly pursues Anna and her friends, trying to expose not just what happened but who Anna really is and where that peculiar accent might have originated. (The show is based on a New York magazine article by Jessica Pressler.)Read MoreStrictly as a viewing proposition it doesn't help that most of the episodes run more than an hour, which breeds a certain flabbiness in the storytelling. The same goes for a structure that shifts the focus to a different one of Anna's marks in each chapter, jumping back and forth in time before reaching the trial and eventually deciding her fate.Along the way Vivian and Anna have several prison interviews, but we're expected to accept that the reporter has bonded with her — or at least finds her oddly endearing, for reasons that frankly seem mystifying — even as she struggles to meet her deadline, hold her life together and, oh yeah, have a baby.If that sounds like a lot, it is, with a tone that's often whimsical. The flashbacks generally work better than Vivian's part of the story, which provides a reminder that portraying the practice of journalism in drama can be a thorny proposition, with a whole lot of misfires for every ""All the President's Men.""Those criticisms don't completely undercut the meatiness of the story, and the schadenfreude of how all these privileged masters and mistresses of the universe were so easily deceived. But it does make ""Inventing Anna,"" finally, a bit of a slog — a series that seeks to be a little too inventive for its own good.""Inventing Anna"" premieres Feb. 11 on Netflix."

In the town of Kobo, ""Tigrayan fighters deliberately killed unarmed civilians, seemingly in revenge for losses among their ranks at the hands of Amhara militias and armed farmers,"" according to Amnesty, who based their investigation on interviews with 27 witnesses and survivors -- 10 of whom marked the date of the massacre as September 9, 2021. Ethiopia is at war with itself.

The investigation also found that dozens of women and girls in the Amhara village of Chenna were raped and brutalized by Tigrayan fighters from July 2021 onwards. The sexual violence was often carried out in the victims' homes and sometimes in front of their families, according to the report. Seven survivors who Amnesty spoke to were younger than 18, and at least one was as young as 14. ""Many of the survivors suffered severe and long-term physical and psychological damage, including 10 who remained hospitalized three months after they were raped. Doctors who provided medical care to rape survivors told Amnesty International that two rape survivors had to be treated for lacerations likely caused by having the bayonets of rifles inserted into their genitals,"" the report said.Amnesty has also received credible reports of rape by Tigrayan fighters in other areas of Amhara, it said.Tigrayan forces summarily executed dozens of civilians in Ethiopia's Amhara region, HRW saysThe report documents mass looting in both Kobo and Chenna where residents accused Tigrayan fighters of having stolen ""possessions from their homes and shops and looted and vandalized public properties, including medical clinics and schools."" ""The looting and damage to medical facilities made it impossible for rape survivors and other residents in need of medical care to obtain treatment locally, forcing them to wait until they could reach hospitals in Debark, Gondar and Bahir Dar weeks later,"" the report said. The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region erupted in November 2020 and spread to neighboring Amhara and Afar regions in July 2021.

Kyari was suspended last August following an FBI indictment linking him to money launderer Ramon Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi, who is awaiting sentencing by a US court for his role in cybercrimes. Before that Kyari was lauded as Nigeria's most decorated cop and a Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the Force's Intelligence Response Team (IRT) until his suspension.

africa,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/africa/elephant-ivory-trafficking-dna-scn/index.html,Tracing DNA of related elephants reveals illegal ivory trafficking networks,"By Ashley Strickland, CNN","Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. (CNN)African elephants have drastically dwindled as targets of the illegal ivory trade, but the DNA contained within their tusks is pointing to the very criminal networks that poached them.Researchers used genetic testing on ivory shipments seized by law enforcement and were able to trace the international crime ring shipping the ivory from Africa. The team tested more than 4,000 elephant tusks from 49 different seizures, made between 2002 and 2019, across 12 different African countries. The findings published Monday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.The study establishes familial connections between the elephants that are being poached for their ivory tusks and reveals the poaching and shipping practices and interconnectedness of the traffickers. This kind of DNA detective work can expose the tactics employed by transnational criminal organizations, believes the research team, comprised of scientists and US Department of Homeland Security special agents. These illicit organizations have operated out of Africa for decades, leading to the heavy decline of thousands of elephants in recent years, according to the study.Read MoreElephant DNA helps authorities make $3.5 million international ivory trafficking bust""These methods are showing us that a handful of networks are behind a majority of smuggled ivory, and that the connections between these networks are deeper than even our previous research showed,"" said lead study author Samuel Wasser, a University of Washington professor of biology and co-executive director of the Center for Environmental Forensic Science, in a statement. Linking elephant family membersDrawing connections between the separate seizures of ivory made at ports that were thousands of miles apart can create a trail of evidence and strengthen cases against those arrested for poaching and smuggling the tusks.This study builds on previous work, published by Wasser and his colleagues in 2018, which showed tusks from the same elephant were often separated and smuggled in different shipments before being seized. These identifications linked the trafficking networks that smuggled ivory from three African port cities in Kenya, Uganda and Togo.The new research broadened the DNA analysis to find elephants that were related in some way, including parents, offspring and siblings. Drawing connections between families of elephants, rather than trying to match individual tusks, helped the researchers understand the scope of the trafficking network.The three networks established in the 2018 study ""are involved with many more seizures and more connected to each other than previously discovered,"" according to the new paper.""If you're trying to match one tusk to its pair, you have a low chance of a match. But identifying close relatives is going to be a much more common event, and can link more ivory seizures to the same smuggling networks,"" Wasser said.Special Agent John Brown, study coauthor and  a criminal investigator with US Homeland Security Investigations, has worked on environmental crime issues for more than 25 years. The forensic analysis in the study can provide ""a roadmap for far-reaching multinational collaborative investigations,"" Brown said.Targeted populationsThe tusks came from both forest elephants and savannah elephants. Forest elephants represent about 6% of the remaining African elephant population and live in the humid forests of West Africa and the Congo Basin. Based on the tusk data from the seizures, tusks were heavily poached from Gabon and Republic of the Congo.DNA tests on elephant tusks expose 'three major export cartels operating in Africa'Savannah elephants roam across the grassy plains and bushlands in West and Central Africa and most of East and Southern Africa. Many of their tusks were poached in Tanzania, northern Mozambique and southern Kenya -- including some from the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area of southern Africa most recently. Then, the tusks were shipped from ports in different countries. But the fact that the separated tusks were still shipped from the same ports helped the researchers determine there were fewer networks moving mass ivory shipments than previously suspected, Wasser said.In elephant populations, females tend to remain in the same family group and males don't move very far even when they emigrate. The genetic connection between the tusks showed how the poachers were targeting specific populations. Dozens of shipments were found to have tight familial connections, some of which spanned years.""Identifying close relatives indicates that poachers are likely going back to the same populations repeatedly -- year after year -- and tusks are then acquired and smuggled out of Africa on container ships by the same criminal network,"" Wasser said. ""This criminal strategy makes it much harder for authorities to track and seize these shipments because of the immense pressure they are under to move large volumes of containers quickly through ports.""Holding traffickers accountableA small group of smuggling networks are the most likely ones responsible for large ivory shipments, which can move mass quantities of tusks on container ships. The genetic data from the tusks linked seizures from the Ivory Coast along the Atlantic Ocean to Mozambique, bordering the Indian Ocean.""There has been a lot of movement to make the sale of ivory illegal in many countries around the world,"" Wasser said. ""However, it has not had a great impact on the kinds of trade that we are talking about when we're getting these big seizures. And when I say a big seizure, it's a minimum size of a half-ton and that can go up to 10 tons or more.""The 17-year span of the study also showed how the networks have shifted to different ports over time, moving from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda to Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Criminals are often linked with one ivory shipment seizure, or ""one block of physical evidence,"" Brown said. But tracking this kind of data could help prosecutors establish links and ensure the criminals are held accountable for everything they've done. ""Extinction of species and ecological collapse through wildlife trafficking can have long-lasting, irreversible, catastrophic impacts on our global community as a whole,"" Brown said. ""So the global effort to combat these illicit crimes is paramount to protecting our environment."""

As long as we remain vigilant, and we act intensely particularly on vaccination, the continent is on track for controlling the pandemic,"" Moeti told a press briefing Thursday.Read MoreAfrica CDC says severe lockdowns no longer tool to contain COVID-19Africa has seen nearly 11 million Covid cases (3% of total cases reported globally) and around 242,000 Covid-related deaths (4.2% of globally reported fatalities) as of February 10, according to the Africa CDC. The continent still lags behind other parts of the world in vaccination as only 11% of its adult population has been fully vaccinated, the WHO said in a statement Thursday.A new phase of the pandemic Africa has battled four waves of the highly transmissible virus. The WHO Africa office said each wave of the coronavirus had come ""with higher peaks or more total new cases than the previous one."" But compared to previous waves, the fourth wave ""was over in six weeks"" and ""represents the first time a wave's surge in cases has not led to a commensurate increase in hospitalizations and deaths,"" WHO stated.Moeti, however, acknowledged that Africa's Covid infection rates could be much higher than the known figures.""We're very much aware that our surveillance systems problems that we had on the continent, with access to testing supplies... have led to an underestimation of the cases,"" she said.Pfizer-BioNTech to start producing Covid-19 vaccines in South Africa in 2022Moeti added that as Africa transitions into a new phase of the pandemic, the continent must strengthen its health systems so it is better prepared to manage future waves of infections.The WHO Africa office said it was spearheading an initiative in 15 African countries to ramp up Covid testing and provide infection prevention tools such as face masks and hand gels. The health agency also said it has, among other initiatives, increased the number of Covid laboratories in the continent from two to over 900 in two years.Last month, the head of the Africa CDC, Dr. John Nkengasong, said he feared that Covid-19 could become endemic on the continent given the slow pace of vaccination, but warned that severe lockdowns were no longer the best way to contain the virus.An estimated 40 million people were plunged into extreme poverty by the pandemic in Africa, according to a World Bank report last April, and containment measures such as lockdowns have cost the continent billions of dollars in lost gross domestic product."

africa,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/africa/africa-coups-resurgence-intl-cmd/index.html,Why are coups making a comeback in Africa? ,"Analysis by Remi Adekoya, for CNN  ","Remi Adekoya is a political analyst and Associate Lecturer at York University. (CNN)In just over a year, Africa has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one more recently in Guinea), one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, and an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president. These power grabs threaten a reversal of the democratization process Africa has undergone in the past two decades and a return to the era of coups as the norm. According to one study, sub-Saharan Africa experienced 80 successful coups and 108 failed coup attempts between 1956 and 2001, an average of four a year. This figure halved in the period from then till 2019 as most African nations turned to democracy, only for it to once again be on the ascendance. Why?Different decade, same problemsIn the early postcolonial decades when coups were rampant, Africa's coup leaders virtually always offered the same reasons for toppling governments: corruption, mismanagement, poverty. Read MoreThe leader of Guinea's recent coup, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, echoed these justifications, citing ""poverty and endemic corruption"" as reasons for overthrowing 83 year old president Alpha Conde. The soldiers who led a coup in neighbouring Mali last year claimed ""theft"" and ""bad governance"" prompted their actions. Likewise, the Sudanese and Zimbabwean generals who toppled Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and Robert Mugabe in 2017 respectively, deployed similar arguments.  Guinean military officer says President Alpha Conde arrested, as apparent coup unfoldsWhile well-worn, these justifications still resonate with many Africans today for the simple reason they continue to accurately depict the reality of their countries. Furthermore, in many countries, people feel these problems are worsening. The research network Afrobarometer conducted surveys  across 19 African countries which showed 6 in 10 respondents saying corruption is increasing in their country (the figure was 63% in Guinea) while 2 in 3 say their governments are doing a poor job fighting it. Furthermore, 72% believe ordinary citizens ""risk retaliation or other negative consequences"" if they report corruption to authorities, a sign Africans believe their public institutions are not just partakers in, but active defenders of, corrupt systems. When it comes to poverty, an already tragic situation has been worsened by the battering Africa's fragile economies took from the coronavirus pandemic.  One in three people are now unemployed in Nigeria, West Africa's largest economy. The same goes for South Africa, the most industrialized African nation. It is now estimated the number of extremely poor people in sub-Saharan Africa has crossed the 500 million mark, half the population. This in the youngest continent in the world with a median age of 20 and a faster-growing population than anywhere else, further intensifying an already fierce competition for resources.  These conditions create fertile conditions for coups and for increasingly desperate young Africans who have lost patience with their corrupt leaders to welcome coupists promising radical change, as was witnessed on the streets of Guinea following the takeover, with some elated Guineans even kissing the soldiers.  But as with the coups of the 1970s these scenes of joy will likely be shortlived, says Joseph Sany, Vice President of the Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace. ""The initial reaction of what you see on the streets will be of joy, but very soon, people will be demanding action...  and I'm not sure the military will be able to deliver on the expectations, basic service delivery, more freedoms,"" he says.Threat to democratic gains  What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades. Worryingly, research shows that many Africans are increasingly ceasing to believe elections can deliver the leaders they want.  Surveys conducted across 19 African countries in 2019/20 showed just 4 in 10 respondents (42%) now believe elections work well to ensure ""MPs reflect voters' views"" and to ""enable voters remove non-performing leaders.""  In other words, less than half believe elections guarantee representativeness and accountability, key ingredients of functional democracies. Across 11 countries polled regularly since 2008, the belief elections enable voters remove non-performing leaders has dropped by 11% points among citizens, according to the survey. It is not that Africans no longer want to choose their leaders via elections, it is simply that many now believe their political systems are gamed.  Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem. The only reason he was still in power until the coup was because he engineered constitutional changes in 2020 to enable himself serve a third-term as president, a common practise by several leaders on the continent, from Uganda's Yoweri Museveni to Alassane Ouattara in Côte d'Ivoire.  Mali's President resigns after he was arrested in a military coupThe African Union is rightly condemning Guinea's coup, but its response to such constitutional abuses has been muted. These double standards and perceived elite conspiracies create the perfect environment for young swashbuckling officers like the 41-year-old Doumbouya to step in and promise to save the day. ""If the people are crushed by their elites, it is up to the army to give the people their freedom,"" said Guinea's new leader, quoting the former Ghanaian president Jerry Rawlings who himself led two coupsIt is perhaps no coincidence Doumbouya quoted the feisty Rawlings, who was very effective at expressing the anger Ghanaians felt towards their political elites when he led military juntas in the 1980s. Desperate citizens living in political systems they often rightly believe are fixed can easily be seduced by anti-elite, anti-corruption rhetoric coupled with the promise of the new. We should, unfortunately, prepare ourselves for the eventuality of more coups in Africa in the coming years. They are not to be expected in richer countries with strong institutions such as South Africa, Ghana or Botswana but in the poorer more fragile states. As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred. Fifteen of the twenty countries topping the 2021 Fragile States Index are in Africa, including countries like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan as well as larger nations like Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia (which has been experiencing violent internal conflict for close to a year now) and Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.Men are marched out of prison camps. Then corpses float down the riverThis increasing probability of coups will make Africa in general less predictable and stable, a negative for investors that could end up worsening the economic situation. Can this undesirable trend be reversed? Yes, but while the international condemnations of coups in Guinea and elsewhere are crucial as deterrents to other would-be power grabbers, the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend are African leaders themselves. They are the ones in charge on the ground and it is their response to these recent events that will be the deciding factor. They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans. But if the problems still being cited to justify coups continue to worsen in today's African democracies, then the temptation to try something else will continue to be dangerously seductive, both for coupists and citizens alike.

The fact that said sounds could be emanating from one of the best basketball players on the planet merely adds to the intrigue.When he's not playing Most Valuable Player-caliber ball for the Philadelphia 76ers -- and his definition of ""a bad night"" was a near triple-double of 26 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists in a 105-87 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday -- five-time NBA All-Star Joel Embiid is rooting for his nation of Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which his homeland happens to be hosting. Saturday's quarterfinal pits the Indomitable Lions against The Gambia in a match Embiid's team is expected to win. Victory would mean Cameroon is two games away from lifting a sixth AFCON title, with the most recent coming in 2017, the center's rookie year for the 76ers.Embiid was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month just three days before Cameroon defeated Egypt 2-1 in the 2017 final; a match-up which, if all things fall into place, could happen again on Sunday, February 6th.Read More""The excitement level has always been huge,"" Embiid tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies about his love of the Cameroon national team dating back to childhood. ""The crazy thing is that when Cameroon would always play, anytime they would score, everybody would just scream. You could hear the whole country just scream.""Joel Embiid is playing at an MVP level this season.The love of the LionsWhile his remarkable journey brought Embiid to America at the age of 16 -- first via high school and college in Florida and Kansas, and subsequently selected 3rd overall in the 2014 NBA Draft by Philadelphia -- he was born a few years after Cameroon's fairytale run to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy.The first African nation to advance to the last eight, a mere seven minutes away from reaching the final four, Cameroon eventually succumbed to England in extra-time. Along the way, the Indomitable Lions wowed the world, starting with the upset of reigning champion Argentina in the opening match. ""Obviously, Roger Milla kind of put us on the map,"" recalls Embiid about the then 38-year-old striker Milla scoring four times at Italia '90, gaining further fame for his trademark goal celebration of dancing by the corner flag.""Going back through history and watching the games, and learning through the history before I was born, and obviously the celebration was a huge part of that history ... we have a lot of history coming from Cameroon, and any time I get the chance to kind of be part of it, I always enjoy.""READ: Iranian women allowed to watch landmark moment as Iran qualifies for World CupEmbiid has watched all of Cameroon's matches at AFCON.Embiid believes that the class of 2022 can reign supreme at Africa's showpiece tournament. ""We're playing at home so any time you've got the support from your home fans that usually adds a lot to your motivation to go on and win every single game,"" he observes.""Playing at home is a huge advantage for us, and I think we've got a chance to win it all ... I'm excited to keep watching and keep supporting.""Cameroon's success at AFCON notwithstanding, the fortunes of a football team pale in comparison to the deaths which occurred at the Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé last Monday due to a stadium crush. At least eight people were killed and 38 injured during the Round of 16 game between Cameroon and Comoros.A somber Embiid says: ""I'm a man of God, so I pray for those families to find peace and also for their loved ones to find peace and be at peace. It is tragic that it happened and I'm extremely sorry for it."" Given the horrific events, what would it mean to Embiid and Cameroon if the team does go on to lift the trophy?""As a country, we've been through a lot,"" he reveals. ""We haven't had any competition [held] over there for a long time, so to be able to finally get it and to be able to win, I think is going to be huge for us.""Embiid tells CNN he's set his sights on winning the MVP award this season.AFCON getting more creditIn the build up to AFCON 2022, there was discussion in some quarters that stars such as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (Egypt) and Sadio Mané (Senegal), Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez (Algeria), Paris Saint-Germain's Achraf Hakimi (Morocco) and Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal) temporarily leaving their club sides behind was such a bitter pill for their club sides and supporters to swallow, it overshadowed the prestige which comes from representing one's country, to say nothing of elevating the tournament to the levels attained across other continents. Embiid follows European football closely, so does he concur that AFCON fails to get the credit it deserves on the global stage?Substitute keeper Abo Gabal the shootout hero as Egypt advance""It's messed up,"" Embiid quickly concludes. ""When it always comes to Africa, I feel like there's always kind of double standards. I never hear any complaints when it comes to the European Cup or any other cups.""[AFCON]'s a little different because obviously it's going on during the season over there, and some of the best players, when you talk about someone like Mo Salah or Sadio [Mané] they're supposed to be playing for their clubs. But I also appreciate them wanting to just go back and represent their country, which is good.""I think we're still earning our respect ... when you look at the success that Africa has in general, we have a lot of talent. Not just in football but in basketball or other sports too. Over time, we're going to overcome that but it's getting there slowly.""As for the big man himself, when asked what would mean more to him -- Cameroon triumphing at AFCON or Embiid winning MVP -- he smiles. ""That's tough! I want both -- both would be great!""It would have been a better question if you were to ask me between Cameroon winning or me winning a championship!"" Asked then which he would prefer, Embiid said, ""Both would be great, like I said, I'm a competitor -- I want to win.""Embiid will be tuning in to watch Cameroon's quarterfinal against The Gambia.After detailing the hard work Cameroon made of their previous opponents Comoros, as the continental minnows played much of the match with 10 men and the entire game with an outfield player in goal, Embiid gives a message to the team of his heart ahead of the challenges which await.""Go out there and keep doing whatever they've been doing. At the end, they've been doing great. They have our full support to continue to do so and I really hope that they're able to keep that cup in our home territory, so I'm gonna keep supporting them. Like I said, I'm going to be watching the rest of the games.""Will we see another iconic celebration like Embiid's Twitter video of Max Verstappen's maiden Formula One title if the Indomitable Lions pull off their sixth AFCON crown? ""I hope the excitement of when we get to the final is the same thing [as the F1 finale]. We might get one!"""

africa,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/09/health/black-fetus-medical-illustration-diversity-wellness-cec/index.html,A viral image of a Black fetus is highlighting the need for diversity in medical illustrations,"By Harmeet Kaur, CNN"," (CNN)At first glance, the image looks like a standard drawing that could easily be found in the pages of a medical textbook or on the walls of a doctor's office.But what sets apart the illustration of a fetus in the womb that recently captured the attention of the internet is a simple, yet crucial, detail: its darker skin tone.The image, created by Nigerian medical student and illustrator Chidiebere Ibe, struck a chord with countless people on social media, many of whom said that they had never seen a Black fetus or a Black pregnant woman depicted before. It also brought attention to a larger issue at hand: A lack of diversity in medical illustrations.(While most fetuses are red in color -- newborns come out dark pink or red and only gradually develop the skin tone they will have for life -- the medical illustration is intended to represent patients who aren't used to seeing their skin tones in such images.)Ibe said in an interview with HuffPost UK that he didn't expect to receive such an overwhelming response -- his fetus illustration was one of many such images he's created as a medical illustrator, most of which depict Black skin tones. But it underscored the importance of a mission he's long been committed to.Read More""The whole purpose was to keep talking about what I'm passionate about -- equity in healthcare -- and also to show the beauty of Black people,"" he told the publication. ""We don't only need more representation like this -- we need more people willing to create representation like this.""CNN reached out to Ibe for comment, but he did not expand on the topic further.Ni-Ka Ford, diversity committee chair for the Association of Medical Illustrators, said that the organization was grateful for Ibe's illustration.""Along with the importance of representation of Black and Brown bodies in medical illustration, his illustration also serves to combat another major flaw in the medical system, that being the staggering disproportionate maternal mortality rate of Black women in this country,"" she wrote in an email to CNN.What medical illustration isMedical illustrations have been used for thousands of years to record and communicate procedures, pathologies and other facets of medical knowledge, from the ancient Egyptians to Leonardo da Vinci. Science and art are combined to translate complex information into visuals that can communicate concepts to students, practitioners and the public. These images are used not just in textbooks and scientific journals, but also films, presentations and other mediums.There are fewer than 2,000 trained medical illustrators in the world, according to the Association of Medical Illustrators. With only a handful of accredited medical illustration programs in North America, which tend to be expensive and admit few students, the field has historically been dominated by people who are White and male -- which, in turn, means the bodies depicted have usually been so, too.Black or 'Other'? Doctors may be relying on race to make decisions about your health""Historically [medical illustrations] have always featured white able bodied male figures and still do in the present day,"" Ford said. ""Bias towards one body type in medical illustration marginalizes everyone else.""Studies have backed up this lack of diversity. Researchers at the University of Wollogong in Australia found in a 2014 study that out of more than 6,000 images with an identifiable sex across 17 anatomy textbooks published between 2008 and 2013, just 36% of the depicted bodies were female. A vast majority were White. About 3% of the images analyzed showed disabled bodies, while just 2% featured elderly people.Why diversity in the field mattersDiversity in the field of medical illustrations (or lack thereof) matters because these images can have implications for medical trainees, practitioners and patients. ""Without equitable representation and the perpetual use of only white able bodied patients depicted in medical textbooks, medical professionals are limited in their ability to accurately diagnose and treat people who don't fit that mold,"" Ford said. ""Medical professionals can then tend to rely on racial stereotypes and generalizations because of this knowledge gap on how symptoms present differently on darker skin tones, leading to poorer care.""A study by the same University of Wollogong researchers published in 2018 found that gender-biased images from anatomy textbooks increased medical students' scores on implicit bias tests. Another study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery -- Global Open in 2019 found that White patients were overrepresented in the images of plastic surgery journals, which the authors suggested could potentially influence the care non-White patients received. Black adults report bias in health care at higher rates than White and Latino people, study finds""For decades, peer-reviewed academic publications have used photographs and images that inadequately portray the diversity in demographics of patients affected by particular diseases,"" the researchers wrote. ""This is particularly striking in the lack of diversity in medical illustration. These inequities in medical reporting can have lasting downstream effects on the accessibility and provision of healthcare.""Ford said that those who aren't often depicted in medical illustrations ""can feel left out and unacknowledged in a healthcare setting, leading to feelings of distrust and isolation when receiving care."" She also said that medical professionals might feel less empathy for groups who aren't represented -- people who are Black, brown, women, transgender or nonbinary -- which can lessen the quality of care they receive. Inequities in health care have been well-documented, with studies showing that Black patients are more likely to experience bias and be misdiagnosed for certain conditions. Research has also shown that a substantial share of White medical students and residents hold false notions about biological differences between Black and White people, which can lead to racial bias in the ways their pain is perceived and treated.Despite the persistent need for medical illustrations to depict the full scope of human diversity, the field is beginning to see changes, medical illustrator Hillary Wilson told CNN.Wilson, whose illustrations depict Black people in infographics about eczema, sun damage, alopecia and other conditions, said both patients and practitioners could benefit from seeing diversity represented in medical illustrations. And through her work, she's attempting to humanize people of color and other marginalized groups by doing just that. ""The reality is that there are so many different types of people that exist,"" she said. ""To me, a resource isn't complete if I didn't at least consider that and try my best to account for the fact that there are so many different types of people.""While Ibe's image of the Black fetus seemed to mark a departure from the norm, Wilson said she hopes that in the future, seeing Black skin tones in medical illustrations will become routine.""Eventually, I hope it can just become one of the things that's expected,"" she added."

Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu is a Rolex Awards Laureate. (CNN)In the bustling Ogere Market in Ogun State, Nigeria, the race is on to sell fresh produce early in the day. By noon, the sun is at its peak, and with temperatures soaring, food spoils fast. As the day wears on, food can sell at less than half of its original value, slashing profits for retailers and farmers. That's why Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu decided to take a fresh approach to food waste. He's the founder of ColdHubs, which provides solar-powered food storage units designed for markets and farms. The 39-year-old has won countless awards for the initiative and has just been announced as the joint winner of the $1.5 million AYuTe Africa Challenge, for promising young innovators who are using technology to reimagine food production on the continent.  Photos: These startups are revolutionizing how we manage wasteWith over 2 billion metric tons of waste produced annually, there's an urgent need to change the way we handle our trash. Luckily, startups are coming up with countless innovations, from smart bins to fly larvae that eat food waste. Look through the gallery to see some cutting-edge waste management solutions.Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: These startups are revolutionizing how we manage wasteColdHubs are 10-foot-square solar-powered cold storage units that have been installed at markets and farms in Nigeria. They can keep produce fresh for up to 21 days, preventing food from spoiling.Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: These startups are revolutionizing how we manage wasteSingapore-based Insectta uses black soldier fly larvae to convert food waste into fertilizer and animal feed (pictured). Now, the startup is developing a method to extract high-value biomaterials like chitosan and melanin from the black soldier flies. Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: These startups are revolutionizing how we manage wasteRecycling Technologies also uses circular waste management solutions to tackle plastic waste. The UK-based company uses ""chemical recycling"" that breaks down plastics using high temperatures into an oil-like liquid called Plaxx. This is then used to manufacture more plastic, increasing the sustainability of the production process.Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: These startups are revolutionizing how we manage wasteThis smart-bin from Bin-e has sensors and uses artificial intelligence to recognize and sort objects. It automatically opens when approached with trash, compresses waste, and notifies the waste disposal company when the bin is full -- automating waste management.

More than 5,250 smallholder farmers, retailers, and wholesalers use its cold rooms and in 2020, the company stored 40,000 tons of food, reducing waste and increasing farmers' profits.  ""This is food meant for human consumption that we typically lose along the supply chain, either during harvesting, transportation, or distribution,"" says Ikegwuonu. ""The mission really is to reduce food spoilage due to lack of cold food storage at key points along the food supply chain."" Read MoreTackling a food waste crisisNigeria is ranked 100 out of 113 countries on the Global Food Security Index. Over 88 million people in the country face food insecurity and 12% are undernourished. The problem isn't a lack of food, though: it's an excess of waste. An alarming 40% of the food Nigeria produces every year is lost before it even reaches consumers. That's equal to 31% of its total land use, according to the World Bank, and accounts for 5% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. How floating islands can make urban waterways green and clean Ikegwuonu's ColdHubs are 10-foot-square cold storage units which keep produce fresh for up to 21 days. Conventional cold storage units of this size would be powered by diesel generators and require 20 to 30 liters of diesel every day, says Ikegwuonu -- but by using solar panels instead, he says that across all its units, the company prevents over 1 million kilograms of CO2 entering the atmosphere each year, while powering the units 24/7. According to the UN, food waste accounts for up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so finding solutions to reduce waste could be vital in the fight against climate change. Storing a crate of produce in the ColdHub costs around 25 cents per day, and has helped farmers and retailers double their monthly earnings, says Ikegwuonu: ""This has been achieved by selling produce that was previously thrown away, sold off at the right price."" ColdHubs are now available at farms and markets in 22 Nigerian states.Scaling upLooking to the future, Ikegwuonu says ColdHubs is also developing technology to freeze produce, for fishing communities in the Niger Delta. ""Most of the coastal communities don't have access to energy at all,"" he says, adding that these freezer storage units would also have the capacity to produce ice blocks. Ikegwuonu also wants to extend his social impact by creating gender parity and jobs in a country where around 35% of all employment is in agriculture, and 90% of rural livelihoods depend on it.""We have been able to create about 66 new jobs for women,"" he says. ""Many of these women have become empowered and change agents in their households and communities.""Ikegwuonu says his current focus is on expanding the business further in Nigeria -- but in the next decade, he has his sights set on other countries struggling with similar food waste problems. ""The big dream for us is to solve the problem of food spoilage in Nigeria, and expand our technology and service to other African countries that have these challenges,"" he says.

""Anyone blocking streets or assisting others in the blocking (of) streets, are committing a criminal offence and you may be arrested.""Many demonstrators have vowed to hold out for as long as necessary, and the federal government has moved to enact emergency powers to freeze financial support of the protests despite opposition in Parliament.Beginning with a group of truckers arriving in Ottawa in late January objecting to a vaccine mandate, the protest has morphed into a general airing of grievances against all Covid-19 safety protocols. The incessant noise, shutting down of area businesses and reports of hate crimes and vandalism by protesters have exacerbated the nerves of many residents.Fact check: Strong majority of Canadians oppose convoy protests, poll after poll findsRead MoreFollowing criticism for the prolonged situation and the recent stepping down of the chief, Ottawa police added in their statement that anyone coming to the capital to join the protest could have their vehicles seized. A charge or conviction ""may lead to denial in crossing the USA border,"" the statement said.The Children's Aid Society of Ottawa, a non-profit organization that gets funding from the Ontario government, is urging demonstrators to make care arrangements for their children as police move forward with ending the protest.  ""If parents and children are separated following police efforts in ending the demonstration in the downtown core, CASO will work to reunite families as soon as possible,"" the organization said in a statement.The latest moves from police come as border crossing blockades along the Canadian-US border have winded down this week. There were no delays at the Emerson checkpoint in Manitoba Thursday morning, according to the Canadian Border Services Agency's website, after the peaceful departure of protesters Wednesday ended the last remaining border disruption. No one was charged, no vehicles were towed and no injuries occurred, officials said. Conservatives in Parliament object to emergency powersAs authorities work to clear demonstrations in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plan to invoke the Emergencies Act to end the protest and cut off the financial support is being criticized by opposition leadership in Parliament. Candice Bergen, interim leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, said Wednesday the party won't be supporting a motion by the federal government to use those powers, according to CNN newsgathering partner CTV.Bergen said Trudeau didn't do enough to bring an end to the demonstrations before invoking the act, CTV reported.Traveling to Canada during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go""The first act that he does when he has a chance to do something -- he doesn't go through step one, two, three -- he goes straight to 100 and invokes the Emergencies Act,"" Bergen told CTV News. ""I don't think anything that we will see will change our mind, we will be opposing it.""The act, passed in 1988 and never utilized before, can temporarily suspend citizens' rights to free movement or assembly. It can also provide for the use of the military, but Trudeau has said this would not be necessary.To invoke powers under the Emergencies Act, the government must propose a motion in the House and Senate explaining why federal officials need the powers and specifying what actions will be taken, then both the House and Senate must confirm the motions, according to CTV.Debate on the House motion will begin Thursday and a vote will be held soon, said Government House Leader Mark Holland, a member of Trudeau's Liberal Party.Trudeau said invoking the act ""is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting peoples' jobs and restoring faith in our institutions.""Trucks parked on Wellington Street, in front of Parliament Hill, during a demonstration in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday.4 charged with conspiracy to commit murder at Alberta protestWhile the Ottawa shutdown is ongoing and the Manitoba blockade dissolved without confrontation, authorities that ended other border demonstrations earlier this week were met with some resistance.Police in Ontario announced the arrest of up to 30 protesters while clearing out a blockade Sunday in Windsor, near the Ambassador Bridge, a critical link for US and Canadian commerce that connects to Detroit.

Four people have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder in connection to the Coutts border blockade, the RCMP said Tuesday. Other charges include possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose and mischief over $5,000, police said. ""Monday's weapons seizure and subsequent arrests speak to the serious criminal activities taking place during this protest and illegal blockade,"" Alberta RCMP Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said in a video statement issued Tuesday.

Plan A and Plan B each required two holes to be drilled - a small hole first and then a wider one about 26 to 28 inches (65-70 centimeters) in diameter. Golborne said the second pass would progress more slowly than the first pass. Plan A involved using a drill placed directly above the shelter where the miners were holed up. Under Plan B, a hole was drilled at a roughly 80-degree angle into an area of the mine shaft that was used as a mechanical workshop. That distance, engineers estimated, was around 2,034 feet (620 meters). The drill used in Plan C needed to cut through some 1,969 feet (600 meters) of rock and earth. Plan A drill was a Raise Borer Strata 950, usually used for drilling ventilation shafts in mines. Plan B drill was a Schramm T-130, usually used for boring water holes. Plan C drill was a Rig 421 drill, usually used for drilling for oil.

While Deans thanked Sloly for his service, she opened the meeting by saying that police were so far unable to achieve peace in the city. ""The OPS (Ottawa Police Service) has been unable to adequately enforce our laws and our residents continue to be terrorized. It isn't good enough,"" Deans said, adding, ""I have watched in disbelief as this carnival of chaos has been allowed to continue."" Deputy Chief Steve Bell is now the interim chief. Deans said the board would implement a new command structure and would shortly appoint a new chief.Read MoreSloly released a statement on social media, saying he was stepping down and had done everything he could to keep Ottawa safe. The department has added resources, enforcement tools and has a new Integrated Command Center, he said.""I am confidant the Ottawa Police Service is now better positioned to end this occupation,"" he said. Sloly had said enforcement has been complex and delicate, pointing out that families are embedded within the protesters. The chief had said repeatedly he did not have enough resources to deal with such a large protest. Residents have told CNN they were dismayed by the chief's lack of enforcement on their city streets.The news comes a day after Canada invoked the country's Emergencies Act for the first time in an attempt to sever financial support for protesters' costly blockades at US border crossings.Financial institutions will now have the power to freeze personal or corporate accounts they believe are being used to fund the illegal protests, Minister of Finance Chrystia  Freeland said Monday.""This is about following the money. This is about stopping the financing of these illegal blockades,"" Freeland said. The government will use the law to target those funding protesters who have blocked border crossings -- resulting in economic losses of as much as $500 million a day, she said.

An unprecedented movePrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday he was invoking the Emergencies Act for the first time since it became law in 1988 to blunt the impact of the trucker-inspired protests. The rallies began when a group of truckers moved into Canada's capital on January 29, clogging streets surrounding the Parliament building and elsewhere in downtown Ottawa to protest a new mandate requiring them to be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canadian-US border or face a two-week quarantine.The Canadian protesters aren't just truckers. Here's who has been showing up and what they wantThey have been joined in Ottawa and at border stops and cities across the nation by others who want an end to other Covid-19 mitigation measures, like mask mandates, lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings. But the protesters are a vocal minority. About four in every five Canadians are fully vaccinated and nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, the government said.""These illegal barricades are doing great damage to Canada's economy and to our reputation as a reliable trading partner,"" Freeland said. The blockade at the Ambassador Bridge, which was cleared Sunday, impacted about $390 million worth of commerce a day, the minister said. The combined impact of blockades at border crossings, including those in Alberta and Manitoba, has been $500 million each day, Freeland said. Why the Ambassador Bridge is crucial to two nations' economies""These costs are real. They threaten businesses, big and small,"" Freeland said. ""The Canadian economy needs (truckers) to be doing legitimate work, not to be illegally making us all poorer."" In addition to allowing financial institutions to freeze accounts suspected of funding illegal protests, Canada is also requiring crowdfunding sites and payment service providers used by protesters to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada and report any large suspicious donations -- including digital payments and with cryptocurrencies. Some sites have raised millions of dollars.While the Emergencies Act allows for the use of the military, the government will not take that step, Trudeau said Monday.  The measure can also temporarily suspend citizens' rights to free movement or assembly, but Trudeau said the government is not overriding the Charter of Rights and Freedoms -- a part of the Canadian Constitution that lays out ""rights and freedoms that Canadians believe are necessary in a free and democratic society,"" according to a Canadian government website.""We are not preventing people from exercising their right to protest legally,"" Trudeau said. The law will be limited geographically, in scope and in time, he noted. Ambassador Bridge owner issues 'call to action'The reopening of the Ambassador Bridge was ""a win for Michigan's working families who are just trying to do their jobs and for businesses who can get back to shipping their products and produce,"" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement Monday.The bridge is the busiest land border crossing in North America, linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. It carries nearly 30% of annual trade between Michigan and Canada, Whitmer said. US auto factories disrupted by Canadian trucker rallyThat blockade, which caused supply chain issues for automakers on both sides of the border, ended when Canadian authorities cleared pedestrians and vehicles that had been blocking access to the bridge over the weekend.Whitmer thanked US and Canadian border officials and business leaders for their work in resolving the ordeal and said it was important to ""ensure that this does not happen again.""The company that owns the bridge echoed that sentiment and issued a ""call to action"" to prevent future closures. ""We must join together to come up with an actionable plan that will protect and secure all border crossings in the Canada/U.S. corridor and ensure that this kind of disruption to critical infrastructure will never happen again,"" said Matt Moroun, the chairman of Detroit International Bridge Company.""They are critical pipelines that supply the goods we need to keep our factories going, our neighbors working and our economies thriving."" In Manitoba, the RCMP said Tuesday that protesters are expected to be gone by Wednesday, the result of a resolution reached with the demonstrators.Chief Superintendent Rob Hill said officials were confident protesters would depart and that full access to the Emerson border crossing will be restored.  US business leaders sound the alarm on US-Canada border blockadeBut the standoff at the Coutts border crossing in Alberta took a turn Monday. Eleven people were arrested, and authorities seized 13 long guns, handguns, multiple sets of body armor, a machete and a large quantity of ammunition and high-capacity magazines connected to a small, organized group within a larger protest at the crossing, Royal Canadian Mounted Police said.""The group was said to have a willingness to use force against the police if any attempts were made to disrupt the blockade,"" the statement said. ""This resulted in an immediate and complex investigation to determine the extent of the threat and criminal organization.""Ontario to loosen pandemic restrictionsWhile protests continue in parts of Canada, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he plans to lift the province's vaccine passport requirements March 1 if hospitalization rates continue to improve.US truckers are frustrated by more than Covid-19Capacity limits will also be eliminated in all indoor public settings starting March 1, though masking requirements in Ontario will remain in effect ""just a little bit longer,"" Ford said Monday.But the loosening of pandemic restrictions has nothing to do with the protests, the premier said.""Let me be very clear: We're moving in this direction because it's safe to do so,"" Ford said Monday. ""Today's announcement is not because of what's happening in Ottawa or Windsor, but despite it."" He also vowed ""serious consequences"" for those who cause disruptions while demonstrating in Ontario. ""To those who are still there, to those of you who are there with the sole objective of causing disruption and chaos, there'll be serious consequences for this lawless activity,"" Ford said. ""We will continue to raise the consequences against those who are holding millions of jobs and people hostage.""

And the government is taking steps to stop financial support of illegal protests.The trucker-inspired protests have for weeks disturbed residents in Ottawa's downtown and recently impeded traffic flow at crossings at the US border.

""We are not preventing people from exercising their right to protest legally,"" he added.The news comes after the Ambassador Bridge -- North America's busiest land border crossing -- reopened Sunday and Ontario, Canada's most populous province, announced plans to loosen pandemic restrictions.For almost a week, protesters blocked the bridge linking Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit -- severing the key trade route and dealing economic blows to both the US and Canada. The bridge reopened Sunday night, allowing ""the free flow of commerce between the Canada and US economies once again,"" the Detroit International Bridge Company said. The leader of Ontario announced the next day he plans to drop the province's vaccine passport requirements on March 1 if its Covid-19 hospitalization rates continue to improve.""The removal of these measures has always been our objective and something we have collectively worked towards for months now,"" Premier Doug Ford announced.""Let me be very clear: We're moving in this direction because it's safe to do so,"" Ford said. ""Today's announcement is not because of what's happening in Ottawa or Windsor but despite it.""Arrests in AlbertaThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Monday it has seized 13 long guns, handguns, multiple sets of body armor, a machete and a large quantity of ammunition and high-capacity magazines connected to a small, organized group within a larger protest at the US border crossing in Coutts, Alberta.The RCMP in Alberta said 11 people were arrested near the border crossing that connects Coutts to Sweet Grass, Montana. ""The group was said to have a willingness to use force against the police if any attempts were made to disrupt the blockade,"" the statement said.

Some sites have raised millions of dollars.""We are making these changes because we know that these platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy,"" she said.The protests that have hindered traffic at border crossings has impacted more that $500 million in commerce each day, Freeland said.Much of that was at the Ambassador Bridge, where 30% of trade by road with the United States crosses, she said. That impacted about $390 million a day, Freeland added. The impact at the Coutts crossing is $48 million and at one in Emerson, Manitoba, it has been $73 million.""These costs are real. They threaten businesses big and small, and they threaten the livelihoods of Canadian workers just as we are all working so hard to recover from the economic damage caused by Covid,"" she said.Protesters not just truckers The ""Freedom Convoy"" protesters' grievances stem from Canada's new mandate requiring truckers to either be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canadian-US border or face a two-week quarantine. The protest has attracted support from thousands more Canadians -- even some who are fully vaccinated but say they want all Covid-19 preventative measures dropped. Why the Ambassador Bridge is crucial to two nations' economiesAbout four in every five Canadians are fully vaccinated, Johns Hopkins University data shows. And nearly 90% of the country's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, according to the Canadian government.Among the relaxed restrictions on tap in Ontario are the removal of some event capacity limits as soon as Thursday. Ontario also has a goal to ""lift proof of vaccination requirements for all settings"" on March 1.But Ontario residents must still wear masks ""for just a little bit longer,"" Ford said. ""This is an important layer of protection that will allow us to proceed with our reopening plans.""Canada's capital gets flooded by protestersMembers of the protest convoy have blocked Ottawa's downtown core and impeded border crossings between Alberta and Montana; Manitoba and North Dakota; and British Columbia and Washington state.The Canadian protesters aren't just truckers. Here's who has been showing up and what they wantTruckers and their supporters have gathered in Ottawa since January 29 to rally against mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions on gatherings and other Covid-19 preventative measures.Protesters will remain in the capital city ""for as long as it takes for governments across Canada to end all mandates"" associated with Covid-19, Freedom Convoy organizers said earlier this month.But Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said Sunday that he had reached an agreement with organizers for them to leave residential areas of downtown and restrict their demonstrations to streets directly in front of Canada's national parliament. Residents this month have reported rock throwing, property damage and harassment by protesters. Police said they had opened dozens of investigations, including into alleged hate crimes. Some downtown Ottawa businesses have had to shut down temporarily.Trucks with Canadian flags drive by anti-vaccine mandate and anti-government protesters Saturday in Surrey, British Columbia, near the border with Washington state. American officials worried similar protests could soon erupt in the US -- perhaps near Sunday's Super Bowl in Southern California. And right-wing media outlets have raised the prospect of like-minded rallies in the US and offered positive coverage of those in Canada.But, so far, the border blockades have been concentrated on the Canadian side.

In a letter provided to CNN from the mayor's office, Tamara Lich, one of the ""Freedom Convoy"" organizers, wrote while some residents have supported and encouraged them, she realized others have been disturbed.""We will be working hard over the next 24 hours to get buy in from the truckers,"" Lich wrote in the letter addressed to Watson.

Some protesters moved away on their own, dismantling a makeshift tent area where they received food and shelter.Some pedestrians remained near an intersection on a road leading to the bridge later Saturday, including some talking to or yelling at a line of standing police officers. Others sang the Canadian national anthem or shouted, ""Freedom!"" No arrest was immediately seen by a CNN crew.

The CNN investigation, published on Tuesday, shed new light onto Moïse's July 7, 2021 killing, including how a secret recording, failed raid and phone records led a stealth team of Haitian investigators to point the finger at Prime Minister Ariel Henry.Multiple law enforcement sources detailed a series of actions that they say connect the Prime Minister to the assassination, including being involved in the plot to kill Moïse and obstructing the subsequent investigation.""These desperate maneuvers constitute a diversion serving to confuse the tracks of the investigation, further weaken the security situation and further destabilize the country, thus aggravating the suffering of the population,"" Jean Victor Généus, the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Culture, said through a diplomatic letter dated Thursday.CNN also obtained exclusive audio of Judge Garry Orélien, the former judge in the assassination case, speaking about Henry. Read MoreHaitian Prime Minister involved in planning the President's assassination, says judge who oversaw case In that recording, Orélien said, ""Ariel (Henry) is connected and friends with the mastermind of the assassination. They planned it with him. Ariel is a prime suspect of Jovenel Moïse's assassination, and he knows it.""CNN verified the recording, taken in fall 2021, by comparing it to other known recordings of Orélien and through extensive conversations CNN has had with him, as well as from voice messages. Orélien did not know he was being recorded.The months-long investigation found that Orélien believes Henry is complicit in the assassination and cover-up, but that he was unable to prosecute him.""Do you think I can touch Ariel (Henry) now? How can I do that? I won't be able to give (any order to indict him), it won't see the light of day,"" Orélien said in the recording.Généus said in Thursday's letter that Orélien ""categorically rejects these lies."" ""I don't recall talking to anyone about the case in great detail,"" Orélien told CNN when asked about the recording. ""Lots of people are trying to influence the case and I will not play their game.""The official case looking into the assassination is still proceeding in Haiti, but practically, it is all but dead. It has produced no new arrests, no new suspects or any evidence since August. Technically, it is still open.The US Justice Department has ramped up its own investigation into the assassination, recently extraditing and charging two top suspects in the case for allegedly planning the assassination on US soil. According to the federal complaint, one of the men provided the arms and ammunition to kill Haiti's President.Two Haitian investigators told CNN they believe that if their US counterparts keep digging, the Prime Minister will also emerge as a key suspect."

But hours after the judge's 7 p.m. deadline for the crowds to clear the area, little had changed. Dozens of people were still on site well after 9 p.m., including many children.

Noncompliance could bring a year in prison and a $100,000 fine, Doug Ford said, adding authorities would consider taking away personal and commercial licenses with anyone who is not complying. The protests were sparked by truckers who oppose Canada's new rule requiring them to be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canadian-US border or face a two-week quarantine. Their ""Freedom Convoy"" has since drawn supporters resisting other Covid-19 preventative measures, including mask mandates, lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings.Demonstrators have also used semitrailers and sometimes farm equipment to block key Canadian-US access points at Emerson, Manitoba, and Pembina, North Dakota, as well as at the Coutts access point between Alberta and Montana.

Possible solutions include persuading protesters to disburse voluntarily; the government giving into demands; and police removing the protesters. Military force is considered highly unlikely as Canada's armed forces are not a police force and they ""are not involved in law enforcement in this situation,"" Defense Minister Anita Anand told CNN.The Trudeau government will send more officers to protests across the country, saying Thursday the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's national police force, continues to show decisive action.""The RCMP are going to be sending additional reinforcements to Ottawa.

americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/americas/brazil-vaccine-campaign-stumbles-bolsonaro-intl-cmd/index.html,Brazil's Covid-19 vaccination drive stumbles as Bolsonaro's disinformation campaign lingers ,"By Camilo Rocha, Rodrigo Pedroso and Marcia Reverdosa, CNN","Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)At the beginning of 2021, hospitals in Brazil's Amazonas state were in a critical state, with ICUs filled to capacity and Covid-19 patients fighting for their lives. ""There were a lot of young people in the last wave getting worse too fast. We had 33- to 40-year-old patients in the ICU. And we had a bigger limitation of medical supplies. Every day we had a shortage of some kind,"" said Dr. Luan Matos de Menezes, an ICU doctor at the Delfina Aziz Hospital in the regional capital of Manaus. Today, it feels like déjà vu. As the Omicron coronavirus variant continues to tear through the country at rapid pace, the hospital's ICU is once again overwhelmed. But one thing is different, Menezes says. This time, he feels that many of those patients are making a choice. Read MoreAlthough more than 86% of the adult population of Brazil is now fully vaccinated, take-up for boosters has been slow, along with lower rates for younger ages. Some infectious disease experts attribute this to the lingering effects of a disinformation campaign in which the country's leadership has played a role. Without that protection, those Brazilians have been vulnerable to the latest wave of Omicron infections sweeping the country.An ICU nurse in Marica, Brazil tends to a Covid-19 patient in January. Menezes, who has been working at the hospital throughout the pandemic, says it is harder to have sympathy for these Covid patients. That's because the majority of the people who are now ending up in the ICU are either unvaccinated or are only partially vaccinated -- even though the vaccines have been available to them for months. More than 80% of people hospitalized with Covid-19 across four Brazilian regional capitals -- Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Manaus and Brasilia -- are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to local government figures. And in Manaus, where Menezes works, nine in 10 people admitted to hospital are not fully vaccinated. ""These are the people who opted not to vaccinate,"" Menezes said. Menezes also told CNN that many of the unvaccinated patients, who are often already seriously ill when they arrive to the hospital, ask for the vaccine when they are admitted. Brazil's parents want their kids vaccinated against Covid. Bolsonaro has tried to stop itBut by that point, it is too late. Brazil has already approaching 640,000 deaths due to the pandemic -- the second highest national toll in the world, according to data by Johns Hopkins University. And this year, the country continues to report record daily Covid-19 cases and deaths. On February 3, the number of daily deaths surpassed 1,000 for the first time since August 2021, according to data from the health ministry. ""Those of us who are at the Covid frontline are seeing a lot of people dying because they did not vaccinate,"" said Menezes, who attributes that vaccine hesitancy to ""a lot of false information being spread"" regarding the vaccines' efficacy and safety. Many public health officials are looking at Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro speaks in Brasilia in November 2021.Bolsonaro, who says he is unvaccinated, has been widely criticized at home and abroad for playing down the severity of the virus, with a longstanding campaign to discredit vaccines under his leadership. Despite this, many Brazilians have taken up the vaccine.But hesitancy still persists, now reflected in booster shot rates and sluggish uptake rates in younger age groups. Only 23% of Brazilians ages 12 and older have received their booster dose so far, compared with 94% who have gotten at least one dose. In younger age groups, those rates drop even lower. Just 10% of children ages 5-11 have gotten the vaccine. They have been eligible to do so since January 17. But some of Bolsonaro's allies appear set to derail that campaign. On January 21, Marcelo Queiroga, Brazil's health minister, and Damares Alves, minister for women and families, visited a family in Sao Paulo state whose child had died of cardiac arrest hours after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine in what some say was an attempt to discredit the vaccine. Sao Paulo's State Health Secretary said that the child had a rare disease and that her death was not linked to the vaccine. That same week, Queiroga had falsely claimed that thousands of people had died from adverse reactions caused by the vaccines -- directly contradicting his government's own data. He later said that those comments were taken out of context by the media. But those comments were already out in the public realm. Bolsonaro supporters demonstrate against Covid-19 vaccines outside the Pan American Health Organization headquarters in Brasilia on January 4.Esther Solano, professor of international relations at Sao Paulo University, told CNN that the officials are intentionally creating confusion around vaccines. ""People feel very lost, they don't know what is true and what is not. It is a strategy of confusion that greatly increases people's distrust of institutions and the press about what is happening,"" Solano said. Dr. Raquel Stucchi, an infectious disease expert and professor at Unicamp University told CNN that Bolsonaro's government had delivered ""repeated messages questioning efficacy and security"" of Covid-19 vaccines, including Bolsonaro himself, who raised the question as to why ""one has to take three doses if before two were enough."" Vaccine boosters and series of doses in vaccines are not unusual. Many vaccines require multiple doses to achieve full immunity, including the polio vaccine, which requires four doses, or the hepatitis vaccine, which requires three. These vaccines are a series, meaning that the second, third or fourth doses are needed to achieve full protection. Dr. Isabella Ballalai, a pediatrician and vice president of the Brazilian Society of Immunizations, told CNN that Brazilian authorities should be concentrating on positive messaging around vaccines -- and making it clear that those who are being hospitalized are largely either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Sarah Santos Costa receives a dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on January 17, 2022, as part of the first group of children under 12 to get the vaccine. 
Ballalai cited robust public health messaging in the UK and the US as an example. Brazil's public health messaging, she said, has been notably weak, with Bolsonaro and his health minister's vaccine rhetoric only adding to the problem. As Omicron first began to surge through the country, Bolsonaro claimed that it ""hadn't killed anyone."" Such language -- that Omicron is less harmful -- could be contributing to people deciding not to get their booster doses, Stucchi said. While studies have concluded that the Omicron variant is less likely to cause severe disease and hospitalization compared to the Delta variant, the problem, she said, is that people aren't connecting the idea that the vaccines themselves are playing a part in ensuring that infections don't develop into more serious cases. ""People assume that they don't need to worry much about vaccination anymore. (But) what we know is that Omicron is lighter because of vaccination,"" she said. Ballalai is urging the country's leaders to send clear and fact-based messaging. It's the only way to stop the cycle, she said, and to keep future generations safe. ""If you don't talk about it, Brazilians don't see the risk. We no longer have the natural demand we saw in the 90s, where everyone looked for a vaccine -- so as to not let their children die,"" she said. "
americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/americas/canada-covid-protest-explainer/index.html,The Canadian protesters aren't just truckers. Here's who has been showing up and what they want,"By Paula Newton, CNN","Ottawa (CNN)A massive protest by Canadian truckers and others against Covid-19 mandates has been growing for weeks, crippling three US border crossings and downtown Ottawa -- with no end in sight. So, why are the demonstrations happening now? What exactly are they about? And what's being done to address them? Here are some key questions and answers about Canada's Covid-19 protests.What are truckers protesting in Canada?Thousands of truckers are participating in the so-called ""Freedom Convoy,"" fighting a vaccine mandate that is forcing all Canadian truckers crossing the US-Canadian border to be fully vaccinated or face quarantine in their homes for two weeks when they return.The rule went into effect in mid-January in Canada and January 22 in the United States. The US Department of Homeland Security now requires noncitizens entering the United States via border crossings or ferry terminals along the US northern and southern borders be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Read MoreA man takes part in a Freedom Convoy protest in Ottawa on February 2.Before this mandate, truckers were exempted from the vaccine requirement and permitted to cross the border, at times testing for Covid-19, even during the 18-month period that the border was closed to nonessential traffic. Truckers were considered vital to keeping supply chains functioning normally. Nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, according to the Canadian government. So, the protesting truckers represent a ""small, fringe minority,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, adding early on that his government did not expect the vaccine mandate to significantly affect supply chains.How have the protests evolved?The Freedom Convoy of truckers began its protest in January in Canada's western provinces, with the goal of reaching the nation's capital, Ottawa, and continuing to protest until the vaccine mandate was lifted. On its cross-country journey, the protest has attracted support from thousands more Canadians, even some who are fully vaccinated, who say they want all Covid-19 preventative measures dropped, including mask mandates, lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings.A large, noisy convoy, including hundreds of trucks and other vehicles, descended January 29 on Ottawa. Since then, they have snarled traffic and honked often and loudly.

Rallies also took place in Toronto, Quebec City, Vancouver and Winnipeg.Meantime, Friday marked the fifth day protesters impeded access to the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit and Windsor, Ontario -- the busiest international crossing in North America.In addition, a mix of semi-trailers and farm equipment shut down the border crossing connecting Emerson, Manitoba, and Pembina, North Dakota, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Manitoba. The Coutts access point between Alberta and Montana has also been blocked.Similar protests soon could erupt in the United States, including around Sunday's Super Bowl in Southern California, American officials warn. Right-wing media outlets have raised the prospect of like-minded rallies in the US and offered positive coverage of those in Canada.What do the protesters want?Protesters will remain in Ottawa ""for as long as it takes for governments across Canada to end all mandates"" associated with Covid-19, Freedom Convoy organizers said last week in a statement. Some want Trudeau to speak with them and hear their opposition to the mandates and restrictions, those protesters told CNN. Trudeau has no intention of meeting with protesters, who hold views ""unacceptable"" to most Canadians, he has said. What has the impact been on Canadians?The blockades have slowed the movement of goods and caused production problems at car manufacturing plants along the border. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have all announced auto production issues in Canada.The Ambassador Bridge ""is too essential to both of our national economies, and ... puts a lot of bread on the table for our families on both sides of the border,"" Windsor, Ontario, Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN this week. In Ottawa, residents and service providers in the downtown core feel like hostages in a city under siege, they've told CNN. Most businesses in the area have been forced to close; they include a large mall next to the protest site.People protest Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Ottawa on February 5.Dozens of trucks remain in Ottawa's downtown core in what local officials have described as an ""occupation."" The police chief calls it ""unlawful,"" as property damage, thefts and mischief have been reported, along with hundreds of alleged hate crimes. Some 1,000 calls related to the demonstration have been received, plus 25 arrests made and more than 1,500 traffic and other tickets issued, police said Thursday.A judge this week signed a temporary injunction that prevents protesters in Ottawa from using horns during their demonstrations, court documents show. In Windsor, Dilkens secured a court injunction Friday to help put an end to the blockade of the Ambassador Bridge. The injunction, which will give police more power to end the ongoing protest takes effect this evening after giving protesters an opportunity to clear the area, Chief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz said.At one point during the hearing, when responding to counsel representing the protesters, Chief Justice Morawetz said the protesters demands for freedom are resulting in the direct denial of freedom for many others in society. ""We're dealing with millions of dollars of damage each and every day,"" he said. ""If they refuse to leave, then police will have operational plans identified, we have resources that have come here from across the province of Ontario and from across Canada with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and one by one we'll start towing the cars if required,"" Dilkens said.People hold signs and wave flags along Wellington Street in front of Parliament Hill on February 5 as part of the Freedom Convoy protest.What has PM Justin Trudeau said about all this?Trudeau, who is fully vaccinated and boosted, has said the protesters do not represent the vast majority of Canadians, about 80% of whom have opted to get fully vaccinated. Most believe public health restrictions save lives, the Prime Minister has said. He implored protesters parked in trucks right outside the parliament building Monday to end their demonstration. Crowds of demonstrators join rallies across Canada as Covid-19 trucker protests spread""Individuals are trying to blockade our economy, our democracy and our fellow citizens' daily lives. It has to stop,"" Trudeau said during an emergency debate in Ottawa that marked his first public appearance since isolating after he and some members of his family contracted the coronavirus.The Prime Minister acknowledged that protesters have a right to voice their concerns but said residents don't deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods.""This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians, but Canadians know the way to get through it is continuing to listen to science, continuing to lean on each other, continuing to be there for each other,"" Trudeau said after underscoring that Canadians are tired of Covid-19 health restrictions. By Thursday, the Prime Minister was employing stronger language in a series of tweets: ""The illegal blockades and occupations happening across the country ... (are) harming the communities they're taking place in -- and they're hurting jobs, businesses, and our country's economy.""Trudeau had spoken with Windsor's mayor ""about the illegal blockade of the Ambassador Bridge ... because it is causing real harm to workers and economies on both sides of the border,"" he tweeted. He'd also spoken with opposition party leaders, asking all lawmakers to ""denounce these illegal acts -- and to call for an end to these blockades.""Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listens to a question from the media availability on January 31.About 80% of Canadians are vaccinated. Why so much angst now?Almost 4 of every 5 Canadians are vaccinated, according to the Canadian government. However, provincial governments and the federal government have enforced various vaccine mandates, stoking ire among those politically opposed and fatigue among others as the pandemic hits its two-year mark.At the federal and provincial level, Canada has enforced some of the strictest Covid-19 measures in the world, with widespread mask mandates and restrictions on the size of gatherings, not only at large events and restaurants but also in private homes.Traveling to Canada during Covid-19: What you need to know before you goA vocal minority of Canadians says they agree with the truckers' protest, saying is it time to drop most Covid-19 restrictions. With so many Canadians complying for so long with vaccine and mask mandates and other Covid-19 measures, some say public health officials and government leaders are now going too far.As one couple who said they are fully vaccinated feel they did their part and now they want to move on, they told CNN.Had Canadians staged serious protests over Covid-19 rules before this?Various smaller protests took place across the country against health measures and mandates in 2020 and 2021. However, this is the largest and most widespread protest of its kind to date during the pandemic.What Covid-19 rules are in place for Canadians who are not truckers?Several provinces are beginning to drop some mitigation measures and allow the reopening of restaurant dining rooms, theaters, cinemas and gyms, albeit with capacity restrictions.Decisions about most of these health restrictions and how and when to ease them are determined not by the Trudeau government but by individual provinces.There is still a federal vaccine mandate for passengers traveling by air domestically or internationally. In addition, all federal public servants are required to be fully vaccinated as a condition of employment.How might the Covid-19 protests end?Possible solutions include persuading protesters to disburse voluntarily; the government giving into demands; and police removing the protesters. Military force is considered highly unlikely as Canada's armed forces are not a police force and they ""are not involved in law enforcement in this situation,"" Defense Minister Anita Anand told CNN.They are protesting Covid restrictions and support is growing. This is what could happen in the Canada protests nextThe Trudeau government will send more officers to protests across the country, saying Thursday the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's national police force, continues to show decisive action.""The RCMP are going to be sending additional reinforcements to Ottawa. I also can advise that the RCMP will be sending reinforcements to Windsor and in addition to that the RCMP have added additional resources at Coutts, in Alberta,"" said Marco Mendicino, Canada's public safety minister.""Our top priority is to make sure that these illegal blockades end,"" he said.CNN's Sharif Paget contributed to this report."
americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/americas/birds-brains-climate-change-scn/index.html,How birds are adapting to climate crisis,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. (CNN)Thousands of birds die each spring and fall when they collide with Chicago's skyscrapers, which lie on a major migration path between Canada and Latin America. But the birds don't die in vain. Since the 1970s, many of them have been collected from the street and cataloged by the city's Field Museum. This unique and detailed set of data has been a scientific windfall, revealing that North American migratory birds appear to be shrinking in response to climate change. A new study of this data has highlighted an important nuance in this trend: Birds that have bigger brains, relative to their body size, are not shrinking as much as their smaller-brained counterparts.Climate change could be making birds shrink in size, study findsThe study is the first to identify a potential link between cognition and animal response to human-made climate change, according to the researchers from Washington University in St. Louis.""As temperatures warm, body sizes are decreasing,"" said Justin Baldwin, a doctoral student at Washington University and author of the study that published this week in the journal Ecology Letters, in a news release. ""But larger-brained species are declining less strongly than small-brained species.""Since the 1970s, migratory birds that died after colliding with Chicago buildings have been collected and cataloged by the Field Museum. The data set is showing how birds are affected by climate change. Read MoreRelative brain size is often considered an indicator of behavioral flexibility in birds, according to the research. The idea is controversial when it's applied to some other animals, Baldwin said, but it works for birds.""Relative brain size correlates with increased learning ability, increased memory, longer lifespans and more stable population dynamics,"" Baldwin said.""In this case, a bigger-brained species of bird might be able to reduce its exposure to warming temperatures by seeking out microhabitats with cooler temperatures, for example,"" he said.The climate crisis is messing with birds' body shapesThe researchers analyzed information from 70,000 birds that died when they collided with buildings in Chicago between 1978 and 2016. They added brain volume measurements and life-span data for 49 of the 52 species in the database.Birds that had big brains, relative to their bodies such as the song sparrow and other New World sparrows, had body-size reductions that were only about one-third of those observed for birds with smaller brains, the study found. Wood warblers (Parulidae) tended to have smaller brains and tended to shrink more. ""The authors from that amazing study shared their raw data ... which allowed us to add to it and discover more,"" Baldwin said via email.A Blackburnian warbler, pictured here, was another of the species of smaller-brained birds that were more strongly affected by climate change.  Shape-shifters It's not known exactly why birds are shrinking in size. Larger body size helps animals in cold places stay warm, while a smaller body retains less heat. Bird wingspans may have increased to compensate for smaller bodies that produce less energy for the incredibly long distances traveled during migration, researchers have also found.Similarly, other research has found that some animals are developing larger beaks, legs and ears that allow them to better regulate body temperature as the planet gets hotter. While most of the morphological changes have been in birds, bats and shrews have also been affected. Climate change has even altered human bodies.Animals are 'shape shifting' in response to climate changeHowever, downsizing comes at a potential cost for a bird, with an increased risk of falling prey to predators or making it harder to compete for resources with other bird species, said study coauthor Carlos Botero, assistant professor of biology at Washington University, in the statement. It's in this context that having a larger brain may offer alternatives that are not available to small-brained species, he said. ""One of the first things that jumps out to me from these findings is that we can already see that climate change is having a disproportionate effect on species that have less capacity to deal with environmental change through their behavior,"" Botero said.""This doesn't mean that climate change is not affecting brainy birds ... or that brainy birds are going to do just fine. What our findings suggest is that climate change can have a much stronger effect on the less-brainy birds."""
americas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/americas/canada-covid-protests-outcome-explainer/index.html,They are protesting Covid restrictions and support is growing. This is what could happen in the Canada protests next,"By Paula Newton, CNN"," (CNN)For two weeks now, Freedom Convoy protesters in Canada have managed to frustrate both law enforcement and political leaders with their unyielding protests against Covid-19 restrictions. Police forces across the country have expressed their reluctance to move in swiftly, saying they prefer to avoid confrontation. The 'Freedom Convoy' started as a truckers' protest by drivers who were fighting vaccine mandates in both Canada and the US. But during the convoy's cross-country journey, it attracted support from many Canadians who say they are fed up with all Covid-19 health restrictions. By the time the convoy arrived in Ottawa, hundreds of drivers and their rigs joined thousands of other protesters in cars and on foot to demand changes to the way the government was handling Covid-19.And protesters' demands have escalated, not just insisting that vaccine mandates be lifted for everyone, but calling for an opening to all businesses including restaurants and gyms, dropping capacity limits at large events and eliminating mask mandates -- especially in schools. As the protests have dragged on, officials at every level of government say they now pose a threat to public security and the economy. Many leaders have demanded the protests cease, but few of those words have been met with concrete action. Read MoreHere are some political and legal scenarios that could play out:  Give peace a chance -- convince protesters to leave voluntarily This is the preferred choice for law enforcement officials who say they recognize Canadians' right to protest. Police in Windsor, Ottawa, and Alberta have stated that they have tried to keep lines of communication open to protest organizers and individual activists, trying to convince them to leave voluntarily. This has had limited success, with protesters bolstered by both messages of support online and material support on the ground with money and supplies. On Thursday, Ottawa police reported that nearly two dozen trucks had been voluntarily removed from two different protest sites. But hundreds remain, still blocking city streets. Access to three US-Canada border crossings cut off by trucker protest blockadesAnd negotiations at border protests have had very limited success, especially in Alberta, where communication efforts seem to have hardened the position of protesters.CNN has spoken to some truckers who say they might consider leaving if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would only speak to them directly about their concerns.""These gentlemen, these guys over in that building and they can just come out and show some respect and you know, at least talk to us,"" said a driver who identified himself as Doran, parked in front of Canada's parliament.Even Ottawa's police chief, Peter Sloly, indicated in the early days of protests that he did not think police were best suited to resolve the situation and that a political solution might be the only effective way to end the protests. Governments give in to protesters' demandsThis is perhaps the least likely of all scenarios. Police and political leaders say it would set a dangerous precedent to give in to ""angry crowds,"" in the words of the prime minister. Several provinces, including Saskatchewan, Alberta and Ontario, have announced in recent days that they will drop some restrictions.Saskatchewan is making changes the most dramatically and quickly, by eliminating its vaccine passport system, dropping mask mandates and reporting Covid-19 cases weekly instead of daily. Alberta is also dropping its mask mandate for children and getting rid of its vaccine passport program.Ontario recently opened restaurant dining rooms and has restored most sporting activities for children and adults.These decisions, however, are unconnected to the protests given that those governments have consistently said that their goal is to lift Covid-19 restrictions as soon as cases and hospitalizations drop.Protesters in Ottawa have also indicated to CNN that they will not be affected by a piecemeal approach to lifting restrictions. They are demanding a nationwide rollback of all Covid-19 health measures. Protestors against Covid-19 vaccine mandates block the roadway at the Ambassador Bridge border crossing in Windsor, Ontario, on February 9, 2022.Authorities remove trucks and cars from protest sitesOttawa officials have been pursuing vehicle-removal options for days, but they have towed very few cars, let alone trucks. They say their efforts are frustrated by tow truck drivers and companies who fear damage to their businesses or worse, a violent confrontation. Ottawa police say they are actively investigating reports that tow truck operators have been threatened and intimidated. Police say they do have some towing capacity but not enough to move a substantial amount of trucks from protest sites without help from private tow truck companies. Ottawa police say they have issued more than 1,700 tickets, and fines for city infractions have in some cases been doubled or tripled.City and provincial officials, responsible for insurance and licensing, also say they are looking to step up enforcement with infractions for parking, insurance and license violations, but this too could take weeks to have any effect. Police forcibly remove protestersLaw enforcement and politicians have been trying to avoid this scenario, fearing both protesters and officers could get hurt. Not only does this risk escalating tensions further and potentially inciting more angry protesters to hit the streets in other parts of the country, but it would require many more officers than are currently available. US auto factories disrupted by Canadian trucker rallyOttawa's mayor, Jim Watson, sent a letter to the prime minister and premier of Ontario asking for reinforcements of 1,800 officers, including administration staff.In a letter provided to the media, Watson writes, ""We must do everything in our power to take back the streets of Ottawa.""The Trudeau government says it continues to dispatch more officers with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to several protest sites, but Ottawa's request for 1,800 extra officers are unlikely to materialize soon, if ever. Ottawa police say they have made 25 arrests to date. Arresting and forcibly removing protesters, however, may be an option that police consider. ""There will be accountability for any unlawful criminal activities that occur in this city in relation to this demonstration,"" said Sloly, Ottawa's police chief, during a Thursday press conference.However, political leaders are aware of the risks of this strategy.""I know many are just saying have the police go in there and move everyone out and restore law and order. And that's sensibly what we all want to see happen,"" Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN in an interview Wednesday. ""The problem is you have a number of folks who are looking for confrontation. You have people who have expressed themselves in the media saying that they believe this is a cause that they are willing to die for.""Use the military to restore orderThis is not only the least preferred option but highly unlikely. Last week, after Sloly suggested it might take the military to resolve protests, he was met with stiff resistance from the federal government. Through a spokesman, Defense Minister Anita Anand told CNN that Canada's armed forces are not a police force and that they ""are not involved in law enforcement in this situation."" Trudeau elaborated further last week, saying, ""One has to be very, very cautious before deploying military forces in situations engaging Canadians. It is not something that anyone should enter in lightly.""Under Canada's Defense Act, a province may request that, ""where a riot or disturbance occurs or is considered as likely to occur,"" the attorney general of the province can request the services of the military ""to be called out on service in aid of the civil power."" However, this is for the province to request and the federal government determines whether to grant the request."

""Our top priority is to make sure that these illegal blockades end.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said late Thursday the blockades were ""hurting jobs, businesses, and our country's economy."" For two weeks now, the trucks have blockaded the downtown core of Ottawa, the capital of Canada. In recent days, demonstrators have parked their bulky vehicles in the middle of critical roadways between Canada and the US.Read MoreThursday marked the fourth day protesters impeded access to the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit and Windsor -- the busiest international crossing in North America. Secondly, a mix of semi-trailers and farm equipment shut down the border crossing connecting Emerson, Manitoba, and Pembina, North Dakota, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Manitoba. And thirdly, the Coutts access point between Alberta and Montana has also been blocked.

The protests were ignited by truckers who oppose the nation's new rule that requires them to be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canada-US border or face a two-week quarantine. Their ""Freedom Convoy"" has since drawn others who are resisting Covid-19 preventative measures, including mask mandates, lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings.""I want all these mandates gone, and I'm not leaving until all the mandates are gone. So, I am here for the long haul,"" Dylan Friesen, a protester in Ottawa, told CNN on Wednesday. ""They can try get rid of us, but we're not leaving.""But officials are taking legal steps to remove the demonstrations. How officials are responding The blockades have slowed the movement of goods and caused production issues at a number of car manufacturing plants along the border. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis all announced production issues due to the blockade.Further, about 60 to 70 vehicles were attempting to disrupt traffic at Ottawa International Airport on Thursday by circling the arrivals and departure terminals, the airport said in a statement. Videos on social media showed a handful of vehicles driving around near a street close to the airport carrying Canadian flags and honking.The Canadian trucker protest is in its second week. This is how we got hereThe mayor of Windsor, Ontario, told CNN on Thursday that city leaders will be in court Friday to seek an injunction against the protestors.  If the protestors are ""unwilling to move on,"" the mayor said tow trucks and equipment would be brought in to help ""move the vehicles out of the way"" to reopen the border crossing. ""Because it is too essential to both of our national economies, and the livelihood of this border crossing puts, the importance of this border crossing puts a lot of bread on the table for our families on both sides of the border,"" Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN's Laura Coates. And if the protesters don't want to leave, the injunction -- if granted-- will expand police's authority on how they may respond, he explained.   ""I get that this injunction would be a single piece of paper, but it gives police more weight in the actions that they are prepared to take, and they will do what is operationally required to move people out.""Trudeau said Thursday he spoke with Dilkens to help contain the situation ""because it is causing real harm to workers and economies on both sides of the border.""Still, Dilkens acknowledged resolving the standoff is a delicate operation. Forcibly removing the truckers could cause even more problems. ""It's very frustrating because people just want us to go in and flush everyone out, and there's a real threat of violence here. We've seen protesters come out with tire irons when the police attempted to tow a car. It could escalate very, very quickly,"" he said.""At the same time, going in and moving out 100 or 200 protesters -- well, we could probably do that. What we don't want to see happen is have 300 more show up tomorrow to replace the ones that were moved out. So, police are trying to negotiate.""Ottawa police said on their website that there have been 25 arrests since protests began about two weeks ago and more than 1,500 tickets have been issued for traffic, noise and other violations.Plus, the city's police chief Peter Sloly said a company that could move the trucks has been threatened.""At least one of the major tow trucks (company) that would have been able to supply us with the logistics to tow illegal vehicles and to a significant degree reduce the size of the demonstrations has been threatened themselves,"" he said. ""They have been threatened through some sophisticated online activities and direct threats to harm to their employees and their business.""He added that authorities might try other options.""We are considering other methods that may allow us to not need to use tow trucks to the extent we initially thought,"" he said. ""All options are on the table.""A criminal investigation into the threats is underway, Sloly said.Similar protests could take place on the other side of the border. American officials are warning that rallies soon could happen in the United States, where right-wing media outlets have raised that prospect and offered positive coverage of the protests.

He was released after some testing.""He looked very ill to me,"" Makins said. ""He was in bed in a great deal of pain and couldn't even reach for his cell phone.""His condition didn't improve even a week later. On September 18, he was having difficulty breathing and moaning in pain, Makins said. He was readmitted to the hospital and immediately put on a ventilator, she said.Mitchell was given paralytics, which are used to prevent patients from moving while on a ventilator. He could not even move his eyes or hands, Makin recalled, in tears.""I spent many, many days and nights with his children at the hospital,"" Makins said.

Now a judge has temporarily banned some from honking their horns,"By Paula Newton, Aya Elamroussi and Paul P. Murphy, CNN"," (CNN)Tensions stemming from protests spearheaded by Canadian truck drivers over the country's Covid-19 mandates have been simmering in recent weeks, so much so that traffic at key US transit points has ground to a stop and a judge has temporarily banned demonstrators in the nation's capital from using horns. For nearly two weeks, Canadian truckers have been protesting a new rule that requires them to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or face a two-week quarantine in their homes after they return across the US-Canadian border. Others have joined to rally against mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions on gatherings and other Covid-19 preventative efforts in the country.Demonstrations have popped up across Canada, including at the Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit and is the busiest international crossing in North America. Idling trucks and vehicles impeded access to the bridge for a third day Wednesday, snarling traffic on both sides of the border.""When the border crossing of this magnitude -- almost a third of all traffic between our two countries crosses here -- and when it closes down, it has an immediate and material impact on the economies of our both nations,"" Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN's Don Lemon on Tuesday night. The Canadian trucker protest is in its second week.

Ontario Superior Court Justice Hugh McLean on Monday issued a 10-day injunction that prevents demonstrating truckers on downtown Ottawa streets from using air or train horns. A hearing is set for next Wednesday.Mayor Jim Watson described the constant honking of large trucks as ""tantamount to psychological warfare"" and wrote in letters to federal and provincial officials earlier this week that, ""People are living in fear and are terrified.""As of Wednesday morning, Canadian-bound traffic at the Ambassador Bridge was still shut down, Michigan officials tweeted. US-bound traffic was flowing for both commercial and passenger traffic, according to US Customs and Border Protection. Access to the bridge from the Canadian side could be tricky, however. Owing in part to protests on that side, traffic was heavy and some roads were blocked. One access route in particular was still open, Windsor police Constable Talya Natyshak said.About 100 protesters were in the area of the bridge in Windsor as of 9 a.m. ET Wednesday, Natyshak said.Canadian-bound and US-bound lanes were open to passenger and some commercial traffic at an alternative, the Detroit-Windsor tunnel, which has height restrictions, according to Canadian and US border websites.An unvaccinated truck driver died from Covid-19. His mom has a message for protesting Canadian truckersAnother alternative, the Blue Water Bridge connecting Port Huron and Sarnia about a 60-mile drive northeast of Detroit, was open to traffic from both sides. While little wait was reported for US-bound traffic and Canada-bound passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles headed to Canada were enduring delays of more than four hours Wednesday morning, according to Canada's website for wait times.The truckers' vaccine rule that kicked off the protests remains. But some of the Covid-19 related restrictions that moved others to join truckers in their protests have started to go away.Provincial public health officials across Canada, who are largely responsible for imposing and lifting most health restrictions, have lifted some measures in recent weeks. As the most recent surge of Covid-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant subsided, nearly all provinces have seen a decrease in new hospital admissions -- though ICU occupancy remains stubbornly high. Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, has said in recent days that it is prudent for provinces to react and adapt health restrictions based on local circumstances. A protester walks in front of parked trucks on February 8 as demonstrators in Ottawa, Canada,  continue to protest the vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Protesters block access to Alberta-Montana crossingProtesting truckers also blocked access Tuesday and Wednesday to a border crossing connecting Coutts, Alberta, to Sweet Grass, Montana, Canadian police said.Demonstrators moved 10 farm tractors and three passenger vehicles onto Alberta's Highway 4 around 8 p.m. Tuesday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesperson Fraser Logan said.The border crossing remained inaccessible Wednesday morning, preventing movement in both directions, Logan said. CNN has reached out to the Canadian Border Services Agency for comment.There was little police could do to remove trucks from Highway 4, RCMP Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said Tuesday. Even if officers were to detain the truckers blocking the road, they wouldn't be able to clear the blockade, he said.""Moving vehicles like these requires special equipment and operators,"" Zablocki said.  DHS bulletin warns trucker convoy could disrupt Super Bowl SundayProtests started in Coutts 12 days ago with more than 250 truckers but as of Tuesday evening had dwindled to around 50, Zablocki said.Alberta Premier Jason Kenney announced Tuesday evening that the province has begun to roll back some Covid-19 restrictions. Albertans won't need to show proof of their vaccination to eat in restaurants or get into venues; some capacity limits are removed; masks mandates for schools will be removed Monday.Kenney addressed the blockade in the news conference, calling it an inconvenience that's hurting business across the province.  ""I've said consistently we welcome the freedom of people to protest lawfully and peaceful, but this is not a lawful protest,"" Kenney said. ""This and other road blockages constitute a safety hazard a serious interference in the lives of others."" Roughly 150,000 trucks pass through the Sweet Grass-Coutts border crossing each year, according to US Department of Transportation. The nearest border crossing to the east adds about two hours of travel to a trip; the nearest crossing to the west adds about an hour. Many Ottawans are at their 'breaking point' In Ottawa, the police department has requested additional resources from Mayor Watson so it can better deal with the unrest. ""We have been 100% full out on this for the last 10 days straight, and we will not rest until it's done, but we need more help,"" Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly said Monday.Sloly has been pushing all three levels of government for ""whatever they can bring to bear on the permanent, sustainable, lawful, safe resolution of this demonstration,"" he said, adding that many Ottawans are at their ""breaking point."" Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau to protesters: 'It has to stop'""This is crushing for those residents and their businesses,"" he said. ""It has to stop, and we are doing everything we can possibly do to stop it. We need more help; we're asking for that help; and we're starting to receive that help, but we need more to get this done.""In letters the mayor wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada's minister of safety and Ontario's premier and solicitor general, he asked for additional officers ""to quell the insurrection that the Ottawa Police Service is not able to contain.""Police have opened more than 60 criminal investigations linked to the protests and 23 arrests have been made. Charges include mischief, flight from police and menacing. More than 1,300 tickets have been issued for violations ranging from excessive noise and use of fireworks to driving a motor vehicle on a sidewalk.A small line of semi-trailer trucks line up along northbound I-75 in Detroit as the Ambassador Bridge entrance is blocked off for travel to Canada on February 8.'It's unclear how this ends,' mayor says Trudeau on Monday acknowledged protesters had a right to voice their concerns but said residents do not deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods.""This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians, but Canadians know the way to get through it is continuing to listen to science, continuing to lean on each other, continuing to be there for each other,"" he said after underscoring that Canadians are tired of Covid-19 health restrictions.Canadian protesters block the busiest international crossing in North America as tensions ramp up over Covid-19 rulesSpeaking to CNN on Tuesday, Dilkens, the Windsor mayor, said Canada is a Democratic society, where protesting is acceptable. ""But blocking off the busiest border crossing between our two nations is not ok. So how do we get at least a lane of traffic open in each direction to allow trucks to continue to flow to get goods to market in the US?"" Dilkens said. Dilkens added that he's not sure what protesters' ""end game"" is ""It has gathered a head of steam, yes, with folks who are feeling upset about vaccine restrictions or mandates, having to wear a mask,"" Dilkens said. ""But it's also been a gathering point and rallying cry for many who are just angry with government in general. And so it is unclear how this ends, and what would make everyone happy so that they go away and stop protesting. We're not sure.""CNN's Paradise Afshar, Raja Razek, Joe Sutton, Keith Allen, Laura James, Jason Hanna, Melissa Alonso, Caroline Kucera, Caroll Alvarado, contributed to this report."

As one of the new owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers, though, basketball great Magic Johnson is going to give it a shot. Here are a few of his colleagues who made the crossover, for better or worse:Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Connie Mack – The ""Tall Tactician"" owned part or all of the Philadelphia A's from the team's founding in 1901 until 1954, when he sold the team to Arnold Johnson. Before his ownership stint, Connie Mack had an 11-year career as a catcher in the National League. Thanks to his 50 years of managing the A's -- and two years managing the Pirates in the 1890s -- he holds major league managing records for games won and lost.Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: George Halas – Though far from a superstar, George Halas played  in 12 Major League Baseball games in 1919. The next year, he joined the Decatur Staleys football team. In 1921, he bought the squad and moved it to Chicago, where it became the Bears. For several years, ""Papa Bear"" was everything -- owner, player, coach, manager and ticket-seller -- and stayed on as coach long after his playing days ended. His family still controls the team.Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Rogers Hornsby – The Hall of Fame hitter bought a portion of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1925 and became the team's manager. At the end of 1926, fresh off a world championship, he became embroiled in a contract dispute with owner Sam Breadon  and was traded to the Giants.

Canadian-bound traffic was still shut down Tuesday morning, Michigan officials tweeted, while US-bound traffic was flowing with limited bridge access, Windsor Police and 511Ontario tweeted.The Canadian trucker protest is in its second week. This is how we got hereFurther threatening supply chain disruptions, protests also blocked traffic overnight Monday at the Coutts access point between Alberta and Montana, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. That crossing partially reopened Tuesday afternoon, with vehicles able to cross into Canada but large commercial vehicles heading to the US asked to use the Aden, Del Bonita and Carway crossings to avoid delays, the RCMP Alberta tweeted.The bold move at the continent's busiest international crossing signals a ratcheting up of demonstrations that have rocked Canada and galvanized thousands against its leadership. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, emerging Monday from a weeklong isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus, echoed residents and officials aggravated by the demonstrations, which began January 29 as an objection to a vaccine mandate requiring truckers entering Canada to be fully vaccinated or face testing and quarantine requirements. Read MoreMore protesters have since joined to rail against mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions on gatherings and other efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. Some have vowed not to leave until certain Covid-19 measures are rescinded, they've told CNN. ""Individuals are trying to blockade our economy, our democracy and our fellow citizens' daily lives. It has to stop,"" Trudeau said Monday at an emergency parliamentary debate in Ottawa.  Canada's capital city has endured widespread turmoil, including blaring horns on downtown streets and businesses forced to close temporarily. More than 60 criminal investigations are underway there, as claims of hate crimes, rock-throwing and property damage were reported, police said Sunday. At least 450 citations were issued over the weekend, they said.On Tuesday, the Ottawa Police Service said 23 arrests have been made since the protests began on charges that include mischief, flight from police and menacing. More than 1,300 tickets have been issued for violations ranging from excessive noise and use of fireworks to driving a motor vehicle on a sidewalk. Ontario Superior Court Justice Hugh McLean on Monday issued a 10-day injunction to prevent demonstrating truckers on downtown Ottawa streets from using air or train horns.Ottawa resident Zexi Li, 21, who lives within five blocks of Parliament Hill, filed a lawsuit calling for an end to the incessant honking. The suit said sound levels from the air and train horns are ""dangerous and cause permanent damage to the human ear"" and cause ""significant mental distress, suffering and torment."" A hearing is set for a week from Wednesday. ""We have been 100% full-out on this for the last 10 days straight, and we will not rest until it's done, but we need more help,"" Police Chief Peter Sloly said Monday, appealing to all levels of government and noting his department asked the mayor's office for a ""significant increase"" in resources. Police stand near protesters Monday after the mayor of Ottawa declared a state of emergency in the Canadian capital. A 10-day protest by truck drivers over Covid-19 restrictions has gridlocked its city center.Many in Ottawa are at their ""breaking point,"" Sloly said.""This is crushing for those residents and their businesses. It has to stop, and we are doing everything we can possibly do to stop it,"" he said.  ""We need more help.""Protests notwithstanding, nearly 90% of Canada's truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, the Canadian government said. Demonstrators represent a ""small, fringe minority,"" Trudeau said, and his government does not expect the vaccine mandate to significantly affect supply chains.Just over 80% of Canadians in all are vaccinated, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.Bridge traffic backed up for milesPolice worked Monday to restore the orderly flow of traffic due to interruptions at the exit from the Ambassador Bridge onto Huron Church Road, Windsor Police said.""Avoid the area or find alternate route, if possible,"" police said, calling traffic flow ""temporarily interrupted.""""Our officers continue to work hard to keep the flow of traffic moving along Huron Church Rd., as well as ensuring order and public safety. ... We encourage everyone to be patient and respectful,"" Windsor Police said on Twitter.Windsor Police posted a photo online earlier in the day showing a long line of trucks appearing to be at a standstill. They also warned of travel delays and a high potential for traffic congestion, and asked ""those involved not to endanger members of the public.""Huron Church Rd. closed off bet. College & Tecumseh Rd W. for all traffic. Avoid the area. We urge those involved not to endanger members of the public, jeopardize public peace or participate in illegal events. Those found committing crimes will be investigated & charged. dg12833 pic.twitter.com/DZDwY69gDs— Windsor Police (@WindsorPolice) February 8, 2022

Access to the bridge from the US side of the border was closed, the Michigan Department of Transportation said Monday night.""The freeway traffic trying to get across the bridge is backed up on multiple roadways and for miles,"" agency spokeswoman Diane Cross told CNN.More than 40,000 commuters, tourists and truck drivers cross the Ambassador Bridge each day, according to its website.Demonstrations affected border wait times Monday at the Ambassador Bridge, Canada Border Services said.Seeking a 'permanent, sustainable, lawful' outcomeOttawa Mayor Jim Watson has declared a state of emergency in response to the protests, and most businesses downtown have closed or reduced their hours because of the unrest. Covid-19: Comparing the US and Canada""No officers are on days off, everyone has been working,"" Sloly said Monday. ""We are stretched to the limit, but we are 100% committed to using everything we have to end this demonstration. We cannot do it alone. ""That's why I have been advocating for all three levels of government to bring whatever they can bring to bear on the permanent, sustainable, lawful, safe resolution of this demonstration."" With protesters parked in trucks right outside the building, Trudeau on Monday acknowledged they had a right to voice their concerns but said residents do not deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods.""This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians, but Canadians know the way to get through it is continuing to listen to science, continuing to lean on each other, continuing to be there for each other,"" he said after underscoring that Canadians are tired of Covid-19 health restrictions. Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau to protesters: 'It has to stop'Conservative opposition leader Candice Bergen accused the Prime Minister of dividing Canadians and asked whether Trudeau regretted calling the protesters ""names,"" regarding his earlier ""small, fringe minority"" comments.""Does he regret calling people names who didn't take the vaccine? Does he regret calling people misogynistic and racists and just escalating and poking sticks at them?"" Bergen asked in parliament.Trudeau responded by saying most Canadians trust each other to do the right things when it comes to following science. ""This is the story of a country that got through this pandemic by being united, and a few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are,"" he said.

technology,http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/tech/how-to-spot-fake-misleading-news-trnd/index.html,Here's how to outsmart fake news in your Facebook feed,"By AJ Willingham, CNN"," (CNN)Just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true. It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn't have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn't breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit. It doesn't have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot -- if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis, the head of the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute.  First, know the different types of misleading and false news1. Fake newsThese are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real. 2. Misleading news These are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren't supported by the information in the article. 3. Highly partisan news A type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda. 4. Clickbait The shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information -- which may or may not live up to what was promised. 5. Satire This one is tough, because satire doesn't pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate. Second, hone your fact-checking skills Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it's important to have a ""healthy amount of skepticism"" and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news. ""If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we'd go a good way towards combating flasehoods,"" he told CNN. Melissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren't immune to fake content. ""People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,"" she told CNN. ""I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn't necessarily mean you're internet savvy.""For starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake:1. Does the story come from a strange URL?     Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like "".co"" or "".su,"" or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales. Read More2. Does the headline match the information in the article?      Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don't bother to click through. Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. ""Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to 'Take Their Business Elsewhere',"" trumpeted one such headline. However, the articles themselves didn't contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi's stock saw a significant drop (it didn't). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump's election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to ""take their business elsewhere.""3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed?      Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney. A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump's election win. The story quickly caught fire online -- after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry. It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio -- in 2015.  It had nothing to do with the election results at all. 4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable?      Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. ""IT BEGINS,"" read the headline. However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the ""bathroom bill"" was to be passed. In fact, according to Snopes, the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy. 5. Does the article cite primary sources?      It's not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral. One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a ""clear parasite"" was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel. Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company. Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found -- because the story is 100% fake. 6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable?A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it: People.com has extensive archives, and this quote is nowhere to be found in them. 7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story? During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as ""reported"" by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as ""reported"" by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It's always good to trace a story back to the original source, and if you find yourself in a loop -- or if they all lead back to the same dubious site -- you have reason to doubt. 8. Is your own bias getting in the way?Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook's algorithm -- the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence. ""We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,"" says Zimdars. ""If we come into contact with information we don't agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.""So if you find an outrageous article that feels ""too good to be true,"" use caution: It just might be. 9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization? Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know you're getting the real deal. View the whole list here. 10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites? This is where things can get tricky. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars' now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list. While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as ""fake"" is not accurate. ""I want to make sure this list doesn't do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,"" she says. ""It's interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing."" "

technology,http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/health/astronaut-back-pain-spine-health-space/index.html,Going to space is a real pain in the back,"By Ashley Strickland, CNN","Story highlightsAstronauts can temporarily gain 2 inches in height but suffer muscle loss and back painMore countermeasures involving exercise may help mitigate pain and muscle loss (CNN)A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study. In 1994, astronaut Mark Lee had his height measured by fellow astronaut Jerry Linenger as part of a study on back pain.Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission. Mars mission astronauts could experience brain damage, study saysThings don't improve when they return to Earth's gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc. ""It's sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,"" said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. ""So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts' backs.""Like being in a body castRead MoreMuch attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang's team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling. Hope, Courage and Unity: The story behind the young cancer patients who painted space suitsWhat they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury. In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren't using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren't bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months. Our bodies in space: Zero gravity weighs heavy on your healthMRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. ""Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,"" Chang explained.Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts' potential time spent in Martian gravity -- 38% of the surface gravity on Earth -- creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.The team's future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.Yoga in space?Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine. Astronauts ask Congress to take care of their healthIn addition to the ""fetal tuck"" position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done. ""A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit."" Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station. Scott Parazynski, who walked in space seven times, assisted with construction on the space station in 2007.Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.One of Chang's teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity. Join the conversationSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.""When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,"" he said. ""Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet. And they look out the other window and just see infinity stretching off into the blackness, and they come back with a different sense of themselves and their place in the universe.""All of them are committed to furthering space knowledge and making incremental steps forward in any way they can for the next crew."""

Attention!"" blares the Russian voice from a loudspeaker. ""The nuclear bombs will be launched in one hour.""Inside a room styled as a Soviet-era nuclear bunker, a couple of Russians race to prevent a catastrophic strike on the United States.Their quest -- the latest craze in Moscow -- is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general. It's complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.But amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.   Read MoreA mad Russian general has pushed the nuclear button - and gamers must stop missiles launching ""I'm worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,"" said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.  ""I know that normal people all over the world don't want any war,"" he added. A nation preparing for conflictBut Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia's old Cold War rival. Russian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry issued this picture from a nationwide civil defense drill The video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.   Of course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.  Analysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction -- or MAD -- still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War. Lithuania issues manual on what to do if Russia invadesBut with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real. ""I don't think nuclear war is likely,"" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a prominent foreign policy journal.""But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don't have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,"" he told CNN. Kremlin playing up fearsIt is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.  In its flagship current affairs show, Russia's top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev -- dubbed the Kremlin's propagandist-in-chief by critics -- recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.  ""Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,"" he declared.Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable conflictThe Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal. The Satan 2, as it's known, will be the world's most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia's place as a top nuclear power. It is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow. ""I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,"" said  Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer. ""But it sounds ridiculous to me and I'm totally sure that war is impossible,"" she adds. The quest game players - pretending to be a special ops team - are the only ones who can avert warBack in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch.  The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack. Hopefully, the real world will be spared such a confrontation too. "

The chair enables its wearer to effectively sit down and stand up at the same time.The Archelis chair.""The Archelis concept is very simple, like the simplicity of Columbus' egg,"" says Dr Hiroshi Kawahira, the surgeon behind the concept. ""Long surgeries can result in back pain, neck pain, and knee pain -- especially for surgeons who are older.""Made of 3D-printed panels, Archelis does not require any electrical components or batteries. The innovation is in the effective design: flexible carbon panels wrap around the buttocks, legs and feet to provide support and minimize pressure on joints.The system stabilizes the ankles and knees, so the pressure from being upright is spread evenly across the shins and thighs.Though the wearer appears to be standing, in fact, they are resting their back and legs while working on their feet. Get to the pointOther wearables are on the smaller side.Measuring about 3 inches long, BIRD is essentially a modern thimble that turns your fingertip into a magic wand.BIRD can control  up to 10 devices at a time. Using algorithms to decode a user's intent, the device also features precise sensors that track direction, speed, and gestures. The technology enables users to turn any surface into a smart screen, as well as interact with other smart devices.Walking around at home, users can project a laptop screen onto a wall, switch on a coffee machine, read on any surface, and make online purchases with the point or swipe of a finger. The developers -- Israel-based MUV Interactive and Japan-based Silicon Technology -- expect BIRD to be embraced by the education and corporate sectors, thanks to its ability to create collaborative presentations."
technology,http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/health/kids-sleep-screens-tech/index.html,Cell phones and screens are keeping your kid awake ,"By Susan Scutti, CNN","Story highlightsDevices in the bedroom are associated with children losing sleep time and quality, new research saysEven children and teens who don't stay up late online are losing sleep (CNN)These days, teachers often face classrooms filled with yawning students who stayed up late snapping selfies or playing online games. For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don't use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.The analysis found ""a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,"" said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King's College London. Carter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.Kids can't sleep? 10 tips that will helpFew parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a ""strong and consistent association"" between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Read MoreSurprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.Though Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was ""how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,"" many of us will probably recognize our own families' habits reflected in the statistics.Electronic bedroomA large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.According to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children's sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game. Light emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.How an early bedtime can have lasting effects on kidsCarter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.""Sleep is vital for children,"" said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. ""We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more."" Kansagra, author of ""My Child Won't Sleep,"" noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. ""It's hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.""Kansagra said it's possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. ""For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,"" he said.Practicing good sleep hygieneDr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child's healthy development, even though ""we don't know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.""In many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. ""Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,"" said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own ""personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.""Join the conversationSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Sleep hygiene -- tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep -- include having a room that is quiet. ""And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,"" Kline said.One more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation, which recommends at least 30 minutes of ""gadget-free transition time"" before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.Other recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment.

It was found in Norway 462 days later,"By Sara Smart, CNN"," (CNN)A miniboat built by fifth graders took to the seas on October 25, 2020, charging off into the Gulf Stream for its maiden voyage. That voyage would take 5.5-foot-long Rye Riptides over 8,000 miles from home -- all the way to the coast of Norway after 462 days at sea.It began at Rye Junior High School, located about 50 miles east of Concord, through a not-for-profit program to spread ocean and environmental literacy called Educational Passage.A tiny boat was discovered on a remote beach 27 years after it was launched by teachersThe miniboat program sends kits to students to help them learn things like science, technology, engineering, art, and math skills as well as building connections, Educational Passage's executive director, Cassie Stymiest, told CNN on Tuesday.Students build the GPS-tracked boat, fill it with items, decorate it and send it on its way. ""It's like a 21st century message in a bottle,"" Stymiest said.The boat, named Rye Riptides, traveled more than 8,000 miles and landed in Norway 462 days after it was launched in 2020.The boat kit was originally purchased in 2018 by a now-retired teacher and each of her fifth-grade classes worked together to build it since then, according to Stymiest.Read MoreWhen the pandemic prevented this year's class from finishing the decorating process, Stymiest volunteered to help out. Students sent their decorations to her and she put the finishing touches on the vessel, which they named Rye Riptides. On launch day, the students watched Riptides set off on Facebook Live.A 50-year pen pal friendship that began with a message in a bottleIn the months after the October launch, classes watched Riptides make its way up and across the Atlantic Ocean through data from the GPS tracker. Its last pinged location was on September 30, 2021, and Stymiest said they thought they had lost the boat when they didn't see another notification for months.But, on January 31, she noticed the location had changed. Riptides had landed on the coast of Smøla, Norway.She immediately took to social media to reach out to the local community about retrieving the vessel. Then, on February 1, Mariann Nuncic responded that the boat was on an island near her house.Karel Nuncic, left, took the vessel to his 6th grade class to open it with his classmates.That afternoon, when her son, Karel, got home from school, the Nuncic's got in their boat and searched the coast to find what was left of the miniboat. And find it they did -- Riptides was covered in Gooseneck barnacles, had lost its mast, and its hull and keel were no longer attached, but its precious cargo was still safe.Karel, who also happens to be in the sixth grade, took the boat to his own class.  They opened it to reveal the items inside, which including leaves, US quarters, and even a face mask with the students' names on it.The Rye Junior High students, who were now in sixth and seventh grade, were excited to hear about the recovery, Stymiest said. The two classes are eager to meet each other and will do so on Thursday through Zoom, Stymiest said.Going from New Hampshire to Smøla may seem like a lengthy journey for such a small boat, but Stymiest said it isn't their longest. That award goes to a vessel sent from Massachusetts that landed in Australia.Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the ocean where the boat sailed. It was the Atlantic."

The team lost to their oldest rival, Team USA, in a penalty shootout in the gold medal match at PyeongChang 2018, ending their winning streak of four consecutive Winter Games gold medals. But in Beijing at the 2022 Winter Games, they finally had their opportunity to make amends, and they seized the moment. It was nervy and exciting, but finally Canada held on to secure a 3-2 victory in the final as they saw a 3-0 lead evaporate under late pressure from Team USA.As the final buzzer sounded, Canadian players erupted into cheers of celebration, some broke into tears and bundled together into a group hug. Read More""It's just so good. It's a great feeling,"" Canadian forward Marie-Philip Poulin, who scored two goals in the final, said. ""It was one hell of an effort. This is redemption.""(Left to right) Sarah Fillier, Jill Saulnier, Renata Fast and Melodie Daoust celebrate with their gold medals after beating Team USA.Ticking downNot that they needed the extra motivation, but Canada women's ice hockey general manager Gina Kingsbury had an innovative way to help her players build up to the 2022 Winter Games. Kingsbury, a two-time Olympic champion as a player, gave each member of the Canadian women's team a clock which counted down the days and hours to the Beijing 2022 Opening Ceremony after Canada finished third in the 2019 World Championships. The clock's purpose was to focus the Canadian players, and it came particularly in handy during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We had a team slogan that was called 'Impact the Red,'"" Canada's Natalie Spooner said. ""Obviously, we couldn't be together as a team every single day, but it was impacting those days when we weren't able to be together, making sure we were improving as individuals and as a team also.""We were looking at that clock all the time. We had it in our houses, and even through Covid, we obviously weren't able to be together for a lot of that time.""So we had that clock there to make sure we did our own work on those off days to make sure we were ready when we came back as a team.""It (the clock) had how many days, hours, minutes, seconds until the Opening Ceremony on it.""Canada's players rush onto the ice in celebration after beating Team USA in the women's ice hockey gold medal match.Each player kept their clock in their own unique locations -- Spooner says she kept hers in the kitchen -- and Poulin says she'll display the clock alongside her gold medal from Beijing. And the Canadian players aren't ruling out resetting the clock for Cortina in 2026. Spooner said: ""The clock is at zero now, but if they re-start the clock for the next four years then maybe (she will put it next to the gold medal).""""Might as well,"" Poulin said when asked whether she will reset it.'Pretty numb'For defending champion Team USA, it was a painful end to its Olympics campaign. The team showed grit and determination to fight its way back into the final, but came up just short in its search for what would be a game-tying goal. US goaltender Alex Cavallini says she felt ""pretty numb"" in the aftermath of the defeat. But for her personally, it was also a ""pretty special"" moment because of the injuries she was battling through. ""I actually tore my MCL (in mid-January 2022) and didn't even know if I was going to make it on the flight here,"" Cavallini explained. ""I didn't have a full practice until three days into when we got here. Our third practice in was when I actually practiced. Didn't know if I was going to get a start or not.""For me to be able to battle it out, thanks to our amazing staff and coaching staff to believe in me even when I didn't and support me along the way -- that was a huge deal for me to even get minutes here.""Alex Carpenter, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Amanda Kessel line up for their silver medals after the women's ice hockey gold medal match.It was a campaign fraught with adversity for Team USA, having lost star player Brianna Decker to a broken leg in the first game.Decker's US teammate, Lee Stecklein, helped push her onto the ice on her scooter to receiver her silver medal. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosAnd Stecklein paid tribute to Decker's impact on the whole squad by remaining with the team.  ""There is no doubt she was going to stay here and be part of this team. The pain she went through, I can't even imagine. ""But for her to be with us means a lot. I know it wasn't easy for her all the time, but we love her very much."""

However, the study, which involved over 149,000 people with a history of Covid-19 infection, also found that the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine is lower in adults over 65. The vaccine was 82% effective among people 16 to 64 years old and only 60% effective in those 65 and older. This study was conducted between March 1, 2021, and November 26, 2021, encompassing the surge of the Delta coronavirus variant in Israel.A universal vaccine could be the future of the coronavirus fightThe study also found that there was no significant difference in vaccine effectiveness if people who were previously infected received one dose or two doses, supporting evidence from other studies that showed one dose was sufficient in protecting people with prior Covid-19 infections from reinfection.These findings may have implications for vaccine policies.Read MoreShane Crotty, a virologist and professor with the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, told CNN that it would be ""quite reasonable"" to have a policy in the US that required people with previous coronavirus infections to get only one dose of a vaccine, based off the results of this research. Crotty was not involved with either study.Ronen Arbel, lead researcher on this study and a health outcomes researcher at Clalit Health Services in Israel, believes that more countries should adopt a policy like what the Israeli Ministry of Health implemented in March 2021, when it recommended a single dose of vaccine for people who had recovered from Covid-19, to be given three months after their primary infection.""If you recovered from Covid-19, it's like you got a primary vaccination,"" Arbel told CNN. ""You should get vaccinated, but once is enough. It's sort of like a booster.""Dr. Tom Frieden: Why I'm cautiously optimistic about Covid-19The second new study, conducted in the United Kingdom, demonstrated that immunity is more durable and longer-lasting in people who had recovered from Covid-19 infection before receiving a Pfizer vaccine.Among participants who were not previously infected, two doses of the vaccine were associated with an 85% drop in risk of infection two months after vaccination. However, that number would fall to 51% six months after vaccination. In contrast, those who were vaccinated after recovering from Covid-19 maintained over 90% protection more than a year after primary infection and over six months after vaccination.""It may be that seeing the whole virus in some form to produce broad immune responses along with a deepening of the immune response with vaccination (either before or after) confers the super immunity,"" said Dr. Monica Gandhi, associate chief of the Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved with either study.The UK research used data from the SIREN study on health care workers. The over 35,000 participants were followed between December 7, 2020, and September 21, 2021, and had PCR testing for Covid-19 every two weeks. It found that among people who were previously infected, the risk of reinfection was 86% less than the risk of primary infection in unvaccinated people. However, this protection fell to 69% more than a year after infection, indicating that primary infection alone does not provide durable immunity.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.According to Crotty, hybrid immunity allows the body to create more diverse antibodies to neutralize a wider variety of variants. This also happens with full vaccination and a booster, but it happens much faster with infection followed by vaccination.""Hybrid immunity has got a whole bunch of additional bonuses to it. One, that these studies are showing quite presently, is durability. Durability is quite robust,"" Crotty said.Although both studies add to growing evidence that hybrid immunity can offer increased protection against future Covid-19 infections, neither includes data from the surge of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.""The overall risk to be reinfected is much higher with Omicron than with Delta. Does the vaccine protect [against Omicron]? We can hypothesize that it does, but we don't have the data yet,"" Arbel said."

Prosecuting attorney Jessica Berliner says Jones is currently imprisoned for murdering a man in 1995 in California, and online records show he is not eligible for parole in that state until 2030. ""The defendant bound Stacy Falcon-Dewey, beat her, orally raped her and likely shot her child to death in front of her before killing her. The extraordinary violence and cruelty of these murders demonstrates the extreme danger he presents to society,"" the court documents said.Colorado police solve four decades-old homicide cold cases with DNA from exhumed killerVianne Falcon, Falcon-Dewey's mother, told CNN affiliate KING on Wednesday that she was emotionally devastated by the loss of her daughter and grandson.Read More""I couldn't believe it,"" she said, referring to the day police told her about the killings. ""And I went running down the street like a wild woman until I found a place I could just collapse and cry.""If convicted, Jones would face a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, the documents said.Jones' arraignment is slated for March 1, according to the Superior Court clerk's office. CNN has reached out to Karim Merchant, Jones' public defender, for comment.How police solved the caseThe bodies of Falcon-Dewey and her son were discovered on October 28, 1994, after a Seattle Times newspaper delivery person called 911 and reported seeing the mother's body, according to a probable cause document. When the officers arrived, they found the pair lying in the middle of the roadway next to the mother's car, both shot in the head, the document said. The gun used in the killings has not been recovered. He spent two decades in prison for church murders. New DNA evidence shows someone else did itPolice say there was a struggle at the scene, based on the evidence collected. ""For instance, some of the contents of Stacy's purse were strewn about the vehicle including her wallet. The keys to the car appeared to have been dropped between the driver's seat and the door and were not readily visible,"" the document says. An initial connection to Jones was established in 2002 through DNA evidence, according to the document. In an interview with the suspect in a California prison, Jones confirmed he lived near Renton from 1994-1995 but denied ever meeting or knowing Falcon-Dewey, the document said. Over the subsequent years, additional evidence was submitted for DNA testing -- and a significant advance was made in December 2021 when DNA traces linked to Jones were found on a jacket worn by Jacob Dewey at the time of his killing, the document said. The prior DNA connection between the suspect and swabs taken from Falcon-Dewey was also confirmed, it said."

Although your teen's brain is working toward a better and more beautiful psychology, this perfectly natural process can often be difficult for families to manage, said Lisa Damour, an Ohio-based clinical psychologist specializing in the development of teenage girls.In those years between the cuddly attachment of childhood and the self-sufficiency of adulthood, teens can cause quite a headache for those who love them. They try their families' patience by arguing more, analyzing risk less and seeming to take on a more selfish attitude. That often leads their families to clamp down harder on restrictions and monitoring, said John Duffy, a clinical psychologist who practices in Chicago.But the stereotype that the teen years are the worst of them is unfair, and this period of trying new things, taking on new perspectives and striking out on their own, and faltering is key to adolescents successfully growing into adults, said Tina Bryson, a therapist in Pasadena, California.Rules and respect still matter, but if family members can understand more clearly what's going on in a teen's head, they can lean into those changes and help their children navigate their way more effectively into adulthood. Read More""If we set high standards for them or speak to them as the best versions of themselves, we tend to get that back from them,"" said Damour, who wrote ""Under Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls"" and ""Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions into Adulthood.""To learn a little more about teens, let's engage in a classic game of two truths and a lie.  True or false? Teens are more argumentativeTrue, and thank goodness they are, Duffy said. A hallmark of teen years is individuation, meaning they are growing out of being just a member of their family and learning who they are as an individual and member of the world. The process to do that often involves defining themselves first as not the same as those around them. That includes the adults in their lives.""Part of the reason you get adolescent pushback is largely not because they dislike their parents, even though they may say they do, but because they're trying to establish who they are, and they know that's got to be something different than Mom and Dad,"" Duffy said.'Kids very rarely do better than their parents are doing.' Here's what to doThis pushback is important for the individual and the community, as opposing the status quo can mean more innovation, said Bryson, author of ""The Power of Showing Up: How Parental Presence Shapes Who Our Kids Become and How Their Brains Get Wired.""Right, but that not fun for the adults in their lives. What can they do to get through it?As hard as it may be, don't take the pushback personally, and celebrate the time of exploration, Damour said.They still need your support and love. ""What we can do is always let them know that we as your family are on team you. You always fit with our family, no matter who you turn out to be,"" said Dr. Hina Talib, an adolescent medicine specialist and an associate professor of pediatrics at The Children's Hospital at Montefiore in Bronx, New York.The good news is that this is just one step in their identity formation, and the end result usually involves ""a beautiful blending together of who you are, where you end and where you started,"" Talib said.Leading your teen through adolescence with understanding will help them grow into competent adults, experts said.True or false? Teens take more risksTrue. They may make those who care for them sigh in frustration or bite their nails in fear, but teens need to take risks, Duffy said. It's not just human teens, either. Adults in one population of sea otters off the California coast know to stay far away from the shark-infested waters, and the young otters know to stay with their parents, Bryson said.But then there are the teen otters who often swim right into it. For teens who are glued to social media, this 4-step plan can help You might say, ""How foolish!"" but it's an important phase of adolescent otter development, where they learn to understand the risks of the predators around them as well as their own abilities and limitations, Bryson said.The thought of letting your own otter pup swim toward the sharks may seem unthinkable, but teens need room to take risks with your support and guidance backing them up.""They are testing their own levels of competence and resilience in the world,"" Duffy said. Letting your teens know you have got their back if they get in too deep and showing that you trust their decision-making are important ways to help prepare them to take on those risks.""Instead of immediately giving advice or jumping to whatever the answer is, I'm going to instead see this as a great opportunity to give my kids some reps, like when we lift weights,"" Bryson said. ""I'm going to give my kids reps where I can say ... 'What do you think would be a good idea?""Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. True or false? Teens are selfishHere is the lie -- for the most part. When your teen makes you late to work because they stayed in the bathroom for an extra 30 minutes or cried because you wouldn't buy them the trendiest shoes, try to think of them not as selfish, but self-searching, Talib said.The teen years are when we first start to have strong feelings of self-consciousness, noticing ourselves in comparison to those around us and worrying that we might not fit in, Duffy said. 20 board games and puzzles for the best family game night (Courtesy CNN Underscored)Your job as a loving adult is not to criticize or crush your teen's feelings that seem to put themselves at the center and the real problems of the world to the side. Instead, try to validate those feelings, Talib said.From there, you can remind your teen of their strengths and all they have going for them, while acknowledging this is a difficult time in their life, Damour said.Though it may be hard to grieve the loss of the child they once were and cope with the changes they are going through now, it's important to treat teens like the kind, capable humans that they can be, hold them to those standards, and be compassionate when they falter, Damour said."

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said Wednesday that the ""appearance of what is racially disparate treatment is deeply, deeply disturbing.""One video of the incident reviewed by CNN shows the boys arguing before the White teenager points his finger at the Black teenager's face, and the Black teenager pushes the White teenager's hand back. The White teenager pushes the Black teenager, who begins to throw punches at the other boy. The White teenager punches back.The Black teenager ends up on the ground. Two Bridgewater Township police officers arrive and separate the two boys.The Black teenager begins to get up and is pinned to the ground by one officer and rolled on to his stomach, with his hands behind his back. The other officer pushes the White teenager onto a nearby couch and then assists in handcuffing the Black teenager. Eventually, officers stand the handcuffed Black teenager up.

Mother of Black teen angered by police responseThe Black teenager, whose name is Kye, and his mother, Ebone, spoke with CNN Wednesday about the circumstances around the fight and their thoughts on the police reaction. CNN is not using the family's last name at their request.""I hate to say this, but if it wasn't for race, then what is it?"" Ebone told CNN's Don Lemon. ""What made them tackle my son, not the other kid? What made them be so aggressive with my son, not the other kid? Why is the other kid sitting down, looking at my son be humiliated and put into cuffs? It just doesn't make sense.

""I want their badges taken away,"" she added.Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the family, said officials haven't given him any information on why Kye was handcuffed.""Why is it the Black kid is presumed guilty and the White kid is presumed innocent,"" Crump said.

http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnnlatest,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/russia-ukraine-us-biden-putin/index.html,US cranks up the information warfare against Putin,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN"," (CNN)Far from buying into claims the Ukraine showdown is easing, the United States is cranking up its relentless informational warfare campaign against Russia, keeping the world on high alert for a possible invasion of Ukraine.The Biden administration -- seeking to maintain pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and to keep its allies united -- is categorically rejecting what it sees as Moscow's misinformation and is warning the threat is only becoming more urgent. A senior official said late Wednesday that Russia had massed another 7,000 troops on the Ukrainian border in recent days, despite the Kremlin's claims that some forces had returned to base in remarks seen as an opening for diplomacy.""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war,"" the official said, reiterating that Russia could fake an incident as a pretext to attack using what President Joe Biden said Tuesday was around 150,000 troops.The new US claims represented the latest gambit in a highly unusual public relations campaign using declassified intelligence meant to remove the element of surprise from Putin and to deprive Moscow of the usual advantage it secures with its mastery of misinformation tactics. Inside Washington, there are few who doubt government claims Putin is ready to invade at any time. But the intensity of US warnings over a period of weeks may soon raise the question of how long Biden can maintain the state of alert, and whether the continued lack of an invasion despite ever-more alarming warnings could open gaps between NATO allies -- and between the US and Ukrainian governments. Such stresses would play directly into Putin's long-term strategic goals. Read MoreBoth the US and Russia, the world's two greatest nuclear powers, say they are ready to negotiate. But they remain far apart on Putin's demands to rip up existing security arrangements in Eastern Europe with the departure of NATO troops from former Warsaw Pact nations.  The US' game is not without risk, since it might push Putin over the edge -- especially if, as some US officials suspect, he's increasingly prone to a bunker mentality and getting little outside advice and perspective from officials willing to challenge his views.Waiting on Putin's next move  By definition, in combat waged with propaganda and dueling information, it's hard to know what is really going on.At this point it's impossible to judge whether the US is genuinely flushing out preparations for an invasion or whether it is taking Putin's bait by exposing troop movements he is ordering in the knowledge that they'll be highlighted by Washington, and therefore increase the sense of insecurity in Europe and anxiety over what he might do next.The showdown over Ukraine has become the most serious geopolitical confrontation in Europe since the end of the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union.The US will not send troops to Ukraine to directly fight Russians. But Biden has rushed forces to reinforce US NATO allies in Eastern Europe. Putin is effectively holding Ukraine, a sovereign, democratic nation, hostage to demand the western alliance pull back from ex-Soviet satellite states like Poland, Romania and Hungary. And if Russia does march into Ukraine, there could be painful consequences for Americans back home, with rising gas prices and energy prices adding to existing inflationary misery.The new US warning about secret Russian maneuvers came amid quickening efforts to keep up Western pressure on Moscow. The White House announced that Vice President Kamala Harris will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference this weekend. The forum, also due to be attended by leading European officials and US lawmakers, is turning into a rallying point for the US and its allies as the NATO alliance faces its most serious test since the fall of the Soviet Union.""We are in a very decisive moment,"" the senior US official said, previewing the most high-profile foreign policy mission for the vice president so far.This week has seen some hope that the crisis could be easing after Russia announced some of its troops were moving away from the border. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken instead Wednesday told ABC News there had been no ""meaningful pullback"" and that Putin could ""pull the trigger"" at any time.""He could pull it today. He could pull it tomorrow. He could pull it next week,"" Blinken said.Putin plays the long gameBut in a fresh sign of discord between the US and Ukraine itself, an intelligence report in Kyiv shown to CNN insisted that the current Russian troop build-up is not enough for a ""successful large-scale armed aggression against Ukraine.""The differing assessments played into the uncertainty and confusion that characteristic of Putin's Machiavellian methods. The Russian leader has observers split between those who believe he is merely seeking to destabilize the government in Ukraine, assert Russian power and assail the Western alliance and those convinced an invasion that could spell a dangerous new era in Europe is imminent.Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that the Russian leader's intentions were almost certainly nefarious. ""I think they are running a disinformation campaign,"" McCaul said. The daunting truth is that while there will be questions of troop readiness, Putin can keep the campaign of pressure up almost indefinitely. In doing so, he could show Ukraine he will never allow it to join the European Union or NATO, dig divisions among Western allies and make a point that Russia must never be ignored again when it comes to security arrangements on the European continent. The crisis has also fulfilled another goal -- as a stream of leaders and diplomats has traveled to Moscow and Putin has spoken frequently to Biden, restoring Russia's image as a great power, following years in which the US minimized its threat and built its foreign policy around confronting China.Even if he doesn't invade, the Russian President has the capacity to turn up the heat any time he feels Russia is not being respected. And days and weeks of prolonging the showdown could discredit US claims an invasion is imminent, weaken Western resolve and restore to Russia its element of surprise. In a long-term showdown, Russia would have the advantage because it cares far more about the fate of Ukraine, a former Soviet federated state, than the West does. While this confrontation lacks the breadth and intensity of the Cold War, when Europe was divided by an Iron Curtain into free nations protected by the US and communist states dominated by Moscow, a geopolitical shift does seem to be taking shape with the possibility for another ossified confrontation.Putin has been in power for more than 20 years, outlasted multiple US presidents and doesn't play by the four-year clock between elections that dominates American politics. He is also willing to subject the Russian people -- who have endured a grueling history -- to more pain than a US President worried about reelection would countenance for theirs. It's one reason why some experts believe he may be willing to risk the withering sanctions that would be triggered by an invasion.'The new normal' NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will also meet Harris in Munich, fueled perceptions of more contentious era dawning in Eastern Europe that mirrored old Cold War divides.""I regret to say this is the new normal in Europe,"" Stoltenberg said in Brussels. ""We do not know what will happen in Ukraine. But the situation has already demonstrated we face a crisis in European security. Moscow has made it clear that it is prepared to contest the fundamental principles that have underpinned our security for decades and do so by using force,"" he added.The fact that the West will gather in Munich to steel itself for new confrontations is ironic since it was at the conference 15 years ago that Putin launched a savage attack on the US and the post-Cold War order that in retrospect was a playbook for his tactics culminating in the Ukraine crisis.The Russian leader bemoaned an era of ""unipolar"" American power at a time when the US was fighting wars of choice in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also lashed out at NATO expansion to include ex-Soviet satellite nations -- the underlying cause of his belief that the West is threatening Russia and that he must prevent Ukraine from falling further under its influence. ""We have the right to ask: Against whom is this expansion intended?"" he said, while hinting at a campaign of ""many years and decades, as well as several generations of politicians"" that would redress the balance.For those who recall his Munich tirade, none of Putin's hard, hostile turn against the United States, his incursion into Georgia, the annexation of Crimea, interventions in US elections and current thuggery toward Ukraine are a surprise.Washington might think it won the Cold War 30 years ago. But recent weeks show the Russian leader is still waging something very much like it, because it is a way to demand respect for his country's power, status and goals.This story has been updated."

""Anyone blocking streets or assisting others in the blocking (of) streets, are committing a criminal offence and you may be arrested.""Many demonstrators have vowed to hold out for as long as necessary, and the federal government has moved to enact emergency powers to freeze financial support of the protests despite opposition in Parliament.Beginning with a group of truckers arriving in Ottawa in late January objecting to a vaccine mandate, the protest has morphed into a general airing of grievances against all Covid-19 safety protocols.

Conservatives in Parliament object to emergency powersAs authorities work to clear demonstrations in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plan to invoke the Emergencies Act to end the protest and cut off the financial support is being criticized by opposition leadership in Parliament. Candice Bergen, interim leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, said Wednesday the party won't be supporting a motion by the federal government to use those powers, according to CNN newsgathering partner CTV.Bergen said Trudeau didn't do enough to bring an end to the demonstrations before invoking the act, CTV reported.Traveling to Canada during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go""The first act that he does when he has a chance to do something -- he doesn't go through step one, two, three -- he goes straight to 100 and invokes the Emergencies Act,"" Bergen told CTV News.

It can also provide for the use of the military, but Trudeau has said this would not be necessary.To invoke powers under the Emergencies Act, the government must propose a motion in the House and Senate explaining why federal officials need the powers and specifying what actions will be taken, then both the House and Senate must confirm the motions, according to CTV.Debate on the House motion will begin Thursday and a vote will be held soon, said Government House Leader Mark Holland, a member of Trudeau's Liberal Party.Trudeau said invoking the act ""is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting peoples' jobs and restoring faith in our institutions.""Trucks parked on Wellington Street, in front of Parliament Hill, during a demonstration in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday.4 charged with conspiracy to commit murder at Alberta protestWhile the Ottawa shutdown is ongoing and the Manitoba blockade dissolved without confrontation, authorities that ended other border demonstrations earlier this week were met with some resistance.Police in Ontario announced the arrest of up to 30 protesters while clearing out a blockade Sunday in Windsor, near the Ambassador Bridge, a critical link for US and Canadian commerce that connects to Detroit.

After all, Trump is, without question, the most popular politician among Republicans -- and history has shown that he has an ability to handpick his preferred candidates in down-ballot races. Except that, so far in 2022, Trump's golden touch appears to have worn off. Bigly.Read MoreThe latest example is former Sen. David Perdue, who is struggling in his GOP primary challenge to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp despite winning Trump's endorsement. As CNN's Michael Warren and Gabby Orr reported on Wednesday: ""Perdue ... has so far raised a fraction of what Kemp has in his campaign war chest. Very few Republican elected officials, operatives, donors and activists in Georgia have abandoned Kemp in favor of Perdue. And limited public polling hasn't been promising, either."" That's not an isolated incident for Trump's preferred candidates. In Alabama, Rep. Mo Brooks has struggled to keep pace financially in the open-seat Senate race. In Pennsylvania, the Trump-backed Sean Parnell ended his candidacy in November after his estranged wife was granted sole legal custody of their children.  In North Carolina, Trump's surprise endorsement of Rep. Ted Budd has done little to narrow the open-seat Senate field. And in Alaska, Sen. Lisa Murkowski continues to far outraise Trump-endorsed challenger Kelly Tshibaka. The question that this series of problems -- or hiccups -- raises is whether Trump's endorsement is declining in value the longer he is out of office. While a majority of Republicans still recognize him to be the leader of the party, his imprimatur may well mean less than it did while he was sitting in the White House. Trump shows no signs, however, of slowing his endorsement roll. According to Ballotpedia, he has already endorsed 98 candidates for the 2022 elections. There are undoubtedly more to come, as Trump issued more than 200 endorsements in the 2020 cycle. The Point: You'd still rather have Donald Trump on your side than against you in a Republican primary fight. But recent data suggests that simply being endorsed by Trump is no longer sufficient to guarantee victory."

The office may ask the appeals court for a re-hearing, the statement continued.North Miami police officer charged with shooting unarmed caretakerEric Schwartzreich and Anthony Bruno, attorneys for Aledda, told CNN, ""We look forward to the State dropping the charges or in the alternative to Mr. Aledda being found not guilty."" In July 2016, Aledda was one of 13 officers who responded to a call about a man with a gun, court documents show. When officers arrived, they encountered Arnaldo Rios-Soto, a man with severe developmental disabilities, and his caretaker Charles Kinsey in the middle of an intersection, according to court documents.Read MoreRios-Soto was rocking back and forth and playing with a silver toy truck, court documents said. Kinsey told the first two officers who arrived that Rios-Soto had a toy. Aledda arrived sometime after that, and some officers on scene said it appeared the toy was a gun. Aledda's lawyers argued that he thought he was observing a hostage situation. He shot at Rios-Soto three times but missed, hitting Kinsey once, according to court documents. Kinsey was wounded in the hip.""He took the shots because he believed that a hostage was in danger,"" Schwartzreich and Bruno said in a statement. Aledda is ""elated by the appeals court decision"" and wants to return to work as a law enforcement officer, Schwartzreich said. CNN reached out to the North Miami Police Department for comment but did not hear back.How the shooting unfolded An affidavit from the July 2016 shooting stated Rios-Soto had ventured into the street outside a home for people with mental disabilities. Kinsey followed him in an attempt to bring him back inside.Rios-Soto sat down in the street and was playing with a silver toy truck, which a passerby thought may have been a gun and called police, according to the affidavit.Charles Kinsey sustained a hip injury in the shooting.As armed officers made their way into closer position, Kinsey lay down on the ground with his hands in the air, yelling at police that there was no threat, according to cell phone footage of the incident.""All he has is a toy truck in his hands. A toy truck,"" Kinsey said in the video. ""I am a behavior tech at a group home.""One officer about 15-20 feet away heard Kinsey's yelling and said over the radio to ""use caution"" because ""the person advised that it's a toy."" A minute later, that officer said over the radio that he had a visual and that the item did not appear to be a firearm.Shortly after that, Aledda shot three times, according to the affidavit.Aledda was charged in 2017 with two felony counts of attempted manslaughter with a deadly weapon, one misdemeanor count of culpable negligence for injuring Kinsey and one misdemeanor count of culpable negligence for endangering Rios-Soto, according to court documents.In March 2019, a jury acquitted Aledda of the misdemeanor culpable negligence charge relating to Rios-Soto. However, a mistrial was declared because the jury could not reach a verdict for the remaining three charges, court documents show.During a second trial in June 2019, Aledda was acquitted on the two attempted manslaughter counts but convicted of misdemeanor culpable negligence, according to court documents.CNN's Eric Levenson and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report."
http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnnlatest,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/sport/womens-figure-skating-scoring-explainer/index.html,Here's how women's figure skating is now scored (and why stamina often leads to more points),"By Holly Yan, CNN"," (CNN)Gone are the days when Olympic figure skating was scored solely at the judges' discretion, with subjective points awarded on a 6.0 scale.A 2002 Olympic figure skating scandal -- with allegations of score-fixing -- upended the sport and led to a complete overhaul of the scoring system -- one that awards more points for stamina and strenuous athletic feats. Now, another Olympic skating controversy has gripped die-hard and casual fans alike. Gold-medal favorite Kamila Valieva, 15, gave a test sample that later tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine on December 25, the day she won the Russian national championship.Russian skating star Kamila Valieva cleared to skate at Beijing GamesTrimetazidine is a medication that can increase stamina and make ""your heart work more efficiently,"" said  Dr. Elizabeth Murray, pediatric emergency medicine physician at the University of Rochester Medical Center.Read MoreBut the positive result wasn't announced by the World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited Swedish lab until February 8, a day after Valieva and her Russian Olympic Committee teammates won gold in the team competition. An Olympic official said Valieva blamed the positive test on a mix-up with her grandfather's medication. The skater's coach, Eteri Tutberidze, told Russian state news agency Tass her entourage is ""absolutely sure"" she is innocent.Valieva was allowed to compete for more gold in the Olympic women's individual figure skating event. Her routine for the free skate -- the final portion of the women's competition -- features quadruple jumps that are untouchable by most of her competitors. Here's how the sport has evolved in recent years to reward increased athleticism and stamina: More difficult jumps = more pointsIn 2004, the International Skating Union ditched the subjective ""6.0"" scoring system for the more rubric-based International Judging System that gives certain base points for jumps depending on their degree of difficulty and how many times the skater rotates in the air.Kamila Valieva competes for the first time since a controversial doping scandal rulingFor example, a quadruple Lutz -- in which a skater makes four revolutions in the air -- carries more base points than a triple Lutz. But a triple Lutz carries more base points than less difficult triples, such as a triple loop or a triple Salchow. After each jump, skaters can gain or lose points from the base value depending on the grade of execution -- how well or poorly they executed the jump.All those numbers are part of the technical score. There's also the presentation score, which rewards artistry and skating skills between jumps. But in recent years, skaters have been able to win competitions largely due to points racked up from jumping -- with quadruple jumps playing a larger role in men's and women's skating. Why better stamina can win skaters more pointsIn women's figure skating, athletes perform two routines: the short program, which is about 2 minutes and 40 seconds long, and the free skate, which is about 4 minutes long. Russian skater Alina Zagitova was 15 when she won Olympic gold after performing all her free skate jumps in the second half of the routine.With the current scoring system, jumps performed in the second half of the free skate can get a 10% bonus because it's more difficult to perform them on tired legs. 2018 Olympic champion Alina Zagitova, who was also coached by Tutberidze, capitalized on this and put all her triple jumps in the second half of her free skate. The 15-year-old Russian won Olympic gold and was celebrated by President Vladimir Putin. Russian President Vladimir Putin presents Alina Zagitova with an Order of Friendship following the Russian teen's Olympic win in 2018.But critics denounced Zagitova's method of winning, saying the teen's performance lacked artistry or relied too heavily on jumps crammed in the second half of the routine to maximize points. After the widespread criticism in 2018, the International Skating Union created a new rule saying skaters will only get 10% bonuses for up to three jumping passes in the second half of their free skate. The new rule has been dubbed the ""Zagitova rule."" Since the last Olympics, women's figure skating has been dominated by Russian teenagers such as Kamila Valieva, Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova. Even if Kamila Valieva wins, she losesAll three have won international championships after adding quadruple jumps in their routines -- an enormous athletic feat.Valieva became the first individual female skater to land a quad at the Olympics when she helped Russian skaters win the team event last week. But if Valieva places first after the women's final, she might not get an Olympic medal around her neck for a while -- if at all.  The International Olympic Committee's executive board said this week that there would be no medal ceremonies for the completed team event or the women's skating competition -- should Valieva place in the top three in that event -- until it's determined whether the skater had violated anti-doping regulations.CNN's Simone McCarthy, Hannah Ritchie and George Ramsay contributed to this report.

http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnnlatest,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/us/ahmaud-arbery-hate-crime-trial-wednesday/index.html,"Two of the men convicted of killing Ahmaud Arbery used racist slurs in messages, a witness testifies at their federal hate crime trial","By Jason Hanna, Pamela Kirkland and Alta Spells, CNN"," (CNN)Texts and social media messages from two of the White men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery included racist insults about African Americans, an FBI intelligence analyst testified Wednesday in their federal hate crime trial in Georgia.FBI analyst Amy Vaughan testified about several text messages between Travis McMichael -- who fatally shot Arbery, a Black man, in February 2020 -- and friends using offensive language and racist slurs. The first text message introduced into evidence was between Travis McMichael and a friend, dated March 16, 2019, in which Vaughan said they were discussing Travis' new job and why he liked that he didn't work with Black people.""They ruin everything. That's why I love what I do now. Not a n****er in sight,"" McMichael said in the message, according to Vaughan. Ahmaud Arbery would not have been killed if he were White, prosecutors say in hate crimes trialVaughan also testified messages found in defendant William ""Roddie"" Bryan's phone showed evidence of racial animus. Read MoreShe found messages using the n-word as well and the word, ""bootlip,"" which she described as ""Mr. Bryan's word of choice."" She went on to explain that ""bootlip"" is a derogatory term for a Black person, referencing a stereotypical characterization of a Black person's face, in her testimony. When a prosecutor asked her if she found evidence of racial animus against African Americans during her investigation, Vaughan said she had. The analyst also testified about a number of messages and social media posts from Travis McMichael that came up in her investigation related to racial violence. On a Facebook video of what Vaughan described as a mob beating a White teenager, McMichael posted a public comment suggesting shooting the group of primarily Black teenagers.The three White defendants -- McMichael, 36; his father, Gregory McMichael, 66; and their neighbor Bryan, 52 -- were convicted in November of felony murder and other charges for Arbery's February 2020 killing in the Satilla Shores neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia.In this federal trial in Brunswick, the three men are each charged with interference with rights -- a hate crime -- and attempted kidnapping. The McMichaels also each face a weapons charge. The McMichaels initially agreed to plead guilty, but the judge overseeing the case rejected the plea deal because of concerns about the agreed-upon sentence. The three men have since pleaded not guilty.Here's how views on race played a role in jury selectionFederal prosecutors and Arbery's family have said he was out for a jog when he was killed. Defense attorneys in the state trial contended the McMichaels, suspecting Arbery of burglary, pursued him through neighborhood streets to conduct a citizen's arrest. Travis McMichael argued he shot Arbery in self-defense as they wrestled over McMichael's shotgun. Bryan had pursued Arbery with his own vehicle and recorded video of the pursuit and shooting.Last year's state murder trial avoided discussion of race. This federal hate crimes trial is more clearly focusing on race, as prosecutors must prove the men acted out of racial animus.The defendants are already serving life sentences in prison for the murder convictions, although they have said they plan to appeal the verdicts. Convictions in this trial could bring steep fines and more life sentences.The jury was finalized Monday morning and consists of eight White jurors, three Black jurors and one Hispanic juror, according to details provided in court. Three White people and one Pacific Islander have also been selected as alternates.Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was chased down and fatally shot in February 2020 outside Brunswick, Georgia.US District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood had warned jurors that they would hear evidence of racist statements made by the defendants. ""You may consider each statement against the defendant who made it,"" the judge said, adding the jury may not consider the evidence to decide if the defendant engaged in the action or to judge the defendant's character, but they may use it to determine whether the defendants acted because of race. The jurors appeared to be very attentive Wednesday, looking at their individual screens while the evidence was shown but didn't appear to express any emotion. Leigh McMichael, mother of Travis and wife of Gregory McMichael, appeared solemn. The defendants appeared stoic and emotionless during Vaughan's testimony, looking at the screens in front of them where the evidence could be seen. Speaking outside the federal courthouse on Wednesday afternoon, Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, said she hoped for ""another guilty verdict"" by the anniversary of her son's death, February 23.""Ain't no quitting until we get justice for Ahmaud,"" Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery Sr., said as he was leaving the courthouse. More messages from Travis McMichaelVaughan testified Wednesday she reviewed the cell phones of Travis McMichael and Bryan; Instagram posts of Travis McMichael; Facebook files for all three defendants; and the Facebook account of the Satilla Shores neighborhood.Vaughan said she had extracted the text messages from Travis McMichael's phone the day Arbery was killed.A text message dated January 21, 2019, referenced Travis McMichael meeting a friend at a local Cracker Barrel restaurant. Vaughan read the conversation aloud in court. The friend tells Travis, ""This Cracker Barrel up here is full of some other kinds of people."" Travis' reply used a racist slur about African Americans.As this discussion was happening, Arbery's father walked out of the courtroom shaking his head. He returned a short time later, still shaking his head as the testimony continued. A Facebook message that Travis McMichael sent another friend, Vaughan testified, included a video with a Johnny Rebel song containing a racist slur. The video was played as part of the evidence in court. The song had been edited onto another video showing a segment from ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" with a young Black boy dancing. The actual video from the show does not use the offensive song.  In another message entered into evidence, dated November 1, 2016, the day after Halloween, Travis McMichael is sent a photo from a friend. Vaughan said the photo appeared to be a ""crude attempt"" to depict Trayvon Martin after he was killed. The text was laughing about a man in blackface with a red splotch on a hoodie, the friend called it ""the winner of Halloween 2016."" Evidence was also entered into record that Vaughan described as showing vigilantism from the older McMichael. Vaughan described a comment from Gregory McMichael on a social media post about a stolen surfboard where he suggested he might catch the culprit, and added: ""We still hang horse and board thieves up here. Woe be to the sticky-fingered bastard.""Bryan used slurs against Black people in messages about Martin Luther King Jr. Day, witness testifiesVaughan testified Bryan regularly used slurs against Black people in messages on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In what appeared to be a personal joke, Bryan was referred to as the ""Grand Marshal"" in a message from a friend. Vaughan testified that this was a joke that referred to the idea that Bryan would be the grand marshal of an MLK Day parade. ""He would never do that, because he doesn't particularly care for Black people or MLK Day,"" Vaughan testified as she explained the joke. Also introduced into evidence was a WhatsApp message dated January 20, 2020, from Bryan to a friend, that was read aloud in court. ""Happy Bootlip Day,"" Bryan wrote. Bryan went on to say, ""I worked like a n***er today,"" according to Vaughan.  Another set of WhatsApp messages discussed Bryan discovering that his daughter was dating a Black man. A message between Bryan and friend dated February 19, 2020 -- four days before Arbery's killing -- had Bryan using a slur in reference to the boyfriend.Vaughan said Bryan's daughter's relationship remained an ongoing theme in messages. A photo posted on Facebook of Bryan's daughter and her Black boyfriend together was sent to Bryan in a WhatsApp message on April 8, 2020. Bryan responded that if his daughter did not care about herself, ""Why should we?""Prosecution argues defendants followed Arbery because of perceptions about Black peopleThe defense argued at the state murder trial that the pursuit began when the elder McMichael saw Arbery running from the direction of an under-construction home, and that he believed he matched the description of someone who'd been recorded there previously.  Unbeknownst to McMichael, a neighbor had just called police to report that Arbery was at the construction site alone, and that Arbery ran as the neighbor called, according to testimony.Federal judge rejects plea deal on hate crime charges in Ahmaud Arbery's killing over sentencing concernsThe prosecution in the murder trial conceded surveillance videos did show Arbery at the construction site multiple times, including the day he was killed, but always without breaking in and without taking anything.During the murder trial, witnesses testified that the McMichaels did not know for certain that Arbery was at the site that day, or whether the man in the videos had ever taken anything. Prosecutors argued the pursuers acted on rumors and had no immediate knowledge Arbery had committed a crime, which is required to claim a citizen's arrest. In opening statements for the hate crime trial, a prosecutor said the defendants previously used racist language and followed Arbery because of their perceptions of Black people.""At the end of the day, the evidence in this case will prove that if Ahmaud Arbery had been White, he would have gone for a jog, checked out a cool house under construction, and been home in time for Sunday supper,"" Assistant US Attorney Barbara Bernstein told the jury Monday. ""Instead, he went out for a jog and ended up running for his life.""The defendants' attorneys, speaking separately, acknowledged the men had used racist language -- but said that their actions toward Arbery were not related to race.""Greg and Travis McMichael followed Ahmaud Arbery not because he was a Black man, but because he was the man who had been illegally entering the house that was under construction,""  A.J. Balbo, Gregory McMichael's defense attorney, said Monday.Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Amy Vaughan's last name.CNN's Kevin Conlon and Nick Valencia contributed to this report."

""Over the past several years, my family has been a source of tremendous encouragement, strength and support,"" Dickson said in a letter Wednesday to FAA employees shared with CNN. ""Nevertheless, after sometimes long and unavoidable periods of separation from my loved ones during the pandemic, it is time to devote my full time and attention to them. As I wrote in my letter to President Biden, it is time to go home.""In a statement, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he is grateful for Dickson's ""years of service to our country and his lifelong dedication to making sure our aviation system is the best and safest in the world.""""While all of us at USDOT will miss Steve as a leader and as a colleague, we are very happy for him and his wife, Janice, as they embark upon this next chapter together,"" Buttigieg said.Read MoreIt is not clear who will take the helm as FAA administrator.Dickson is about halfway through his term as the head of the agency, which has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including navigating the Covid-19 pandemic's sharp blow to air travel and soaring numbers of unruly commercial passengers.In 2021, the United States saw the worst year on record for unruly airplane passenger behavior, according to FAA data. The agency logged 5,981 reports of unruly passengers as of December 31, and of those, 4,290 -- nearly 72% -- were Covid-19 mask-related incidents.Dickson executed the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy for disruptive passengers, saying at the time of his order: ""Flying is the safest mode of transportation and I signed this order to keep it that way."" The policy, which took effect in January 2021, skips warnings or counseling and goes directly to legal penalties for unruly behavior. It was extended at least until the federal mask mandate is lifted.On Wednesday, the FAA announced that 43 more cases of unruly passengers had been referred to the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution. Recently, Dickson became the target of telecom companies for the FAA's handling of the rollout of new 5G cell service, which threatened possible interference with critical safety systems on commercial airliners.Dickson also oversaw the return of the Boeing 737 Max to service after two fatal crashes abroad grounded the plane worldwide. A former Delta Air Lines pilot, in 2020 Dickson flew the Max himself on test flights before it was returned to passenger service. Dickson began his career in the military and later flew commercial aircraft including the Boeing 727, 737, 757 and 767. In his post at Delta he was responsible for flight safety and pilot training.This story has been updated with additional details."

Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN)How to contain a runaway Covid outbreak, in a city committed to keeping cases at zero? That's the question now facing Hong Kong officials, as daily infections top 4,000, and previous fail-safe systems begin to buckle under the strain of their own uncompromising rules. For almost two years, Hong Kong had relied on a combination of stringent quarantines and sophisticated track-and-trace efforts to isolate positive cases, keeping the city comparatively virus-free -- even as the rest of the world began to loosen restrictions.  But those measures no longer appear sufficient in the face of the latest Omicron wave, which officials have described as a ""tsunami."" Hong Kong's insistence on sending all positive cases to hospital, irrespective of the severity, has led to at least one hospital being so overwhelmed it was forced to move patients on gurneys outside, lining them up in the parking lot.Read MoreMeanwhile, a raft of tightened restrictions and targeted lockdowns have led many experts and residents to question the sustainability of such an approach as the city enters the third year of the pandemic.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam at a news conference on February 15.On Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping took the unusual step of directly calling on Hong Kong officials to take ""all necessary measures,"" according to comments published on the front pages of two Chinese state-run newspapers. Xi's intervention has raised fears that further restrictions similar to those seen in mainland China, including a possible citywide lockdown, could soon follow. So far, the local government has firmly ruled out such a move, suggesting it would be impractical to confine more than 7 million people to their homes. But Xi's comments make clear that Hong Kong has little choice but to adhere to China's hard-line zero-Covid strategy -- whatever the cost.The biggest outbreak yetThe newest wave began in January, and quickly spun out of control despite authorities' increasingly desperate efforts.In mid-January, the government killed more than 2,500 hamsters and other small animals after a single Covid case was linked to a pet store, sparking widespread public outrage.Days later, a housing cluster prompted the government to lock down several buildings home to thousands of people. Soon, residents began complaining of trash piling up in the hallways, and of pay cuts for those who weren't able to work during the lockdown.In hindsight, it was an early sign of the chaos to come, and of a government unequipped for a wave of this magnitude despite having had more than two years to prepare.To date, less than 70% of the city's population has been fully vaccinated against Covid, according to government data, and vaccination rates among the elderly remain comparatively low despite vaccines being available since February 2021. Health officials push a trolley of supplies outside a locked-down residential building in Hong Kong on January 23. With numbers rising, authorities reimposed a series of familiar restrictions: closing all schools; shuttering bars, gyms, salons and numerous public spaces; suspending restaurant dine-in past 6 p.m., capping public gatherings; doubling down on a citywide mask mandate; and prohibiting more than two households to mix in private. But these measures -- part of the government's zero-Covid playbook each time a new outbreak arises -- failed to stop the surge. On Wednesday, the city reported a record 4,285 new cases. Before this wave, Hong Kong had never seen more than 200 new cases in a day.Many of the government's rules were formed with the zero-Covid goal in mind, such as hospitalization for all those who test positive for Covid -- regardless of their condition -- mandatory tests for anybody who may have been exposed, and quarantine of close contacts.Hong Kong's 'zero Covid' strategy frustrates travel-starved residentsThese rules and processes may have worked when Hong Kong was only dealing with a few dozen cases at a time -- but the scale of the latest outbreak has stretched the system to breaking point. As of Monday evening, seven of Hong Kong's 17 public hospitals had either reached or exceeded 100% inpatient bed occupancy -- leading to the makeshift outdoor wards, which could pose a problem this weekend with rain and cold temperatures expected. Long lines stretch across the city, with people waiting hours to get tested.But rather than consider different approaches, the government -- under pressure from Beijing -- has dug its heels in, more determined than ever to contain the outbreak.""At this moment, we still feel that (dynamic zero-Covid) is the best strategy for Hong Kong,"" the city's leader Carrie Lam said last week -- referring to a new label that aims to quickly suppress all outbreaks.Even before Xi's reported instructions, the Chinese central government stepped in earlier this week -- seemingly growing impatient with Hong Kong's inability to rein in the virus itself.  China will send health experts and medical supplies to Hong Kong, and help build new quarantine and isolation facilities, officials said -- bringing to mind the temporary hospitals that were constructed and operational within weeks in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic, at the start of it all.Lam has publicly welcomed the central government's support, admitting Tuesday that Hong Kong was struggling to cope with the exponential growth of cases. ""The problem we are facing is, given the magnitude, pace and severity of this fifth wave, it has outgrown our capacity,"" she said. A widening gapThough Hong Kong has been aligned with Beijing in pursuing zero-Covid, it could have taken a different route -- one now playing out in a very similar city, 1,600 miles (about 2,600 kilometers) away.Last August, Singapore -- which for years has competed with Hong Kong for the title of Asia's top international business hub -- was the first Asian country to declare it was moving away from a zero-Covid policy to living with the virus instead. It was soon followed by Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and others.People walk in the Kreta Ayer district of Singapore ahead of the Lunar New Year on January 29.The mood in Singapore is now drastically different than in Hong Kong. A high vaccination rate and reopened travel with two dozen countries mean daily life has more or less resumed. Though cases there are spiking as well, people are able to go to the movies, meet friends at the bar, even attend sports events and live concerts. The few restrictions left -- like caps on social gatherings -- may soon be lifted too when the Omicron wave subsides, the health minister said Monday. ""Like most Singaporeans, I am looking forward to it,"" he added.But there is little of that optimism in Hong Kong, with leaders defiant even as the city's tough travel restrictions render it increasingly isolated from the world. ""With the full support of the central (Chinese) government, the government's united effort, and citizens' full support, we have to fight against this wave of the virus,"" Lam said on Tuesday. ""Surrendering to the virus is not an option."""

Throughout their yearslong investigation and search for the child, detectives had visited the house several times, but it wasn't until a critical tip this week that authorities were able to get a search warrant and go into the home's basement, where they discovered the missing girl.Paislee, now 6, was released to her legal guardian and reunited with her older sister, police said Tuesday. She is in good health, but has missed out on important experiences like attending school, police said.Her mother, father and a third man have been charged. An attorney for one of the three defendants has urged for patience until ""the facts come out.""Here's what we know so far. Read MorePolice had visited a key home nearly a dozen timesThe child was reported missing on July 13, 2019, from Cayuga Heights, a village on the outskirts of Ithaca in upstate New York.At the time, she was believed to have been abducted by her parents, Kimberly Cooper and Kirk Shultis Jr., who did not have custody of her, the Saugerties Police Department said in a news release this week. Police chief Joseph Sinagra confirmed to CNN the two are Paislee's biological parents. In the early days of the investigation, the girl's father denied knowledge of her whereabouts, and he told police Cooper had taken their daughter and fled to Philadelphia, the news release added. Several of the tips authorities received in the past two years led them to a home in Saugerties, a town that is about 160 miles east of Cayuga Heights. But without a search warrant, officers were often denied entry and were allowed only ""limited access"" on a few occasions, the chief said. ""We'd been at the home ... almost a dozen times over a two-year period to follow up on leads,"" Sinagra said. Kirk Shultis Sr and Jr. would give officers limited access, police said, and would not allow them into the bedrooms or basement area. And each time, they denied knowing anything about the child, the chief said, adding, ""They lied to us for two years, including the father, stating that he had no idea where his daughter was.""An important tip led to the girl's rescueThis week, an individual gave authorities the information they had been looking for to obtain a search warrant for that home, the chief told CNN.""This tip was fresh, it was factual, the information provided was corroborated,"" he said. Though authorities had received other information about the home previously, Sinagra said, they were not able to execute search warrants ""on hearsay."" Police did not say what the tip was or whom it came from. But as soon as police received that piece of information, they took action. ""We immediately sent uniformed police officers to the residence and they stationed themselves outside the residence at around 4 o'clock"" on the afternoon of February 14, 2022, he said. ""The purpose of that was to make sure nobody left or came while our detectives were drafting up the search warrant,"" the chief added. ""Once that search warrant was issued at approximately 8:06 p.m. ... we executed that search warrant.""What detectives found in the houseFor the first time, detectives were able to search every room in the house and go to the basement, where the police chief said they found what resembled an apartment. ""There was a kitchen, there were bedrooms, a living room area. One of the bedrooms was devoted to Paislee. It had her name on the wall, there (were) clothing items that were spread about the bedroom, the bed had appeared to have been slept in,"" Sinagra said. The residents told police the girl was not at the home, and said they had set up the room that way in case she ever returned. The child's room was also near a staircase, under which police would eventually discover the young child and her mother hiding. A detective made the discovery after noticing something was odd about the stairs, and after a closer look saw a blanket between the cracks, the chief said. ""So they grab some tools and they start dissembling the staircase. And as they're removing the steps off the staircase, they see a set of feet, little feet,"" the police chief said. In that hiding spot, police also found blankets, a pillow, and clothing items, the chief said, adding it was apparent that location had been used more than once. ""It is our opinion, based on our investigation, that that location was used probably each and every time that we sent an officer to the residence to follow up on a lead,' he said. Here's what police found in the hiding spot where Paislee was discovered.Parents lost custody before she went missing, chief saysCooper was charged with two misdemeanors: custodial interference in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child. Carol K. Morgan, an attorney for Cooper, said, ""We should all wait until the facts come out. Everyone should be patient before they draw their own conclusions.""Kirk Shultis Jr. and Kirk Shultis Sr. were each charged with custodial interference in the first degree, a felony, and endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor. Lawyers for the two declined to comment.Hearings for all three were held Wednesday and their cases were adjourned for a later date. Sinagra told CNN that Cooper and Shultis Jr. lost custody of Paislee and her sister in 2019, before the disappearance. A legal guardian was granted custody, the chief said. ""Depending on what the reason was why Paislee and her sister were removed from their mother and father's custody, that may have been rectified by now,"" he said. ""Whatever that deficiency was, may have been corrected and those parents may have had full custody of their children today but this is going to be a major setback for them.""What we know about the girl's conditionWhile police searched the home, Paislee did not make a sound, Sinagra said. ""Not a word, until they were fully exposed,"" he said, adding that when she was eventually discovered by police, the child was upset. ""I'm sure that when she saw several of our officers, who were heavily armed ... that was somewhat traumatizing to the child.""But she was found to be in good health, and by the next day, Tuesday, she seemed to be in good spirits, he said. ""We don't know what Paislee lived with for the past two years and we don't know what kind of damage may have been done because of the conditions that she had to live under,"" the chief said. ""She was separated from her sibling, she didn't function like a normal child, as far as having the ability to go to school.""Police have not shared any details about the guardian Paislee was released to, or the nature of their relationship.

By afternoon/evening, a powerful storm will begin to impact the Plains and Mississippi Valley with severe storms and winter weather,"" the National Weather Service (NWS) tweeted.Precipitation types expected across the country Wednesday through Friday morning. The potential for heavy snow began Wednesday over the northern Rockies, where more than a half foot of snow could be dropped near Denver. However, larger snow totals are likely to the east. This system is expected to drop snow spanning from the central Plains region to southern Michigan on Thursday, with possible totals in some areas of almost a foot. Read More

""It looks like right now the heaviest snow will stretch from north-central Oklahoma all the way to Detroit with a thin band of ice just south of that line. Another item of concern will be the areas that change from rain and freezing rain to sleet pellets and finally to a layer of snow on top,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. Cities at risk for snow and ice include Kansas City, Chicago and Lansing, Michigan. In addition to snow of more than 2 inches per hour at times, regions in the path of the storm will be subject to high winds, creating an even greater hazard.""The combination of heavy snow and strong gusty winds may lead to severely reduced visibility and hazardous travel conditions on Thursday and Thursday night,"" the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) tweeted.Up to a tenth of an inch of  freezing rain is expected from central Missouri to northern Ohio, which could make travel treacherous. The Southwest may escape the worst of the storm; however it will experience its own weather hazards Wednesday. Extreme wind gusts of up to 75 mph are possible in the area. A combination of low relative humidity and gusty winds could create the optimal environment for fire hazards, leaving more than six million people under red flag warnings.The threat for severe storms emerges as the system moves eastward""As the advancing cold front clashes with the warm and moist airmass Wednesday night, a line of thunderstorms may develop across North Texas and Oklahoma,"" the WPC noted. ""The potential exists for storms to produce damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes in this region.""The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) posted a slight risk for severe thunderstorms, Level 2 of 5, for northern Texas and Oklahoma for late Wednesday into early Thursday. Severe thunderstorms pose a threat of damaging winds, large hail and possible tornadoes. ""We constantly talk about the 'ingredients' necessary for a thunderstorm to produce a tornado. A few tornadoes are likely with the stronger storms, but this, at least right now, does not look like a massive tornado outbreak,"" Myers pointed out. However, tornadoes in the overnight hours do present an increased danger to the public, primarily because people are asleep and may not hear severe weather warnings or may be inside vulnerable structures.""You should always have a way to get warnings, especially at night,"" Myers emphasized. As a cold front advances to the east Thursday, the threat of severe weather and heavy rainfall does, too.The projected threat of severe storms for the Mid-South and Southeast Thursday.The SPC projects an enhanced risk region over much of the Mid-South and Southeast on Thursday, one level higher than Wednesday's slight risk, putting cities including Memphis, Nashville and Murfreesboro in Tennessee and Tuscaloosa in Alabama particularly vulnerable to the threat of damaging winds and tornadoes.A combination of heavy rain along the cold front and intense rainfall rates associated with thunderstorms will produce a risk for flash flooding across the southern US. The South is not the only region at risk of flooding. ""A Slight Risk (Level 2 of 4) of excessive rainfall is in effect from southern Illinois to western New York, as well as over parts of the Southern Appalachians on Thursday. These areas are expected to have the greatest chances for scattered instances of flash flooding"" The WPC reported. Landslides and flooding kill at least 34 in BrazilRegions farther north have the potential for flash flooding as a result of melting snow, in addition to heavy rain the storm will bring. Basically, this storm has it all, and more storms similar to it are likely. ""As we move closer to spring, the combination of severe weather on the southern part of a storm and snow on the northern side becomes more common,"" Myers added.Whether it's your rain jacket or your snow boots, be sure to stay prepared and informed over the next 48 hours."

Lynch, who was the first Black female attorney general in US history, will defend the NFL in the racial discrimination lawsuit filed by Flores earlier this month, along with Brad Karp of the Paul, Weiss firm, according to NFL vice president of communications Brian McCarthy. Lynch joined the firm, which also represented the league on concussion issues, in 2019. Lynch led an independent investigation into Syracuse University's Department of Public Safety in the wake of student protests in 2020 over the university's handling of racist incidents on campus.When asked about the NFL hiring Lynch, the legal team representing Flores did not comment.The Dolphins fired Flores in January, and the team announced Mike McDaniel as their next head coach earlier this month. Flores was 24-25 in his three years with the Dolphins, including a 9-8 record this past season when Miami missed qualifying for the playoffs.Read MoreIn his lawsuit against the NFL and three teams -- the Dolphins, Denver Broncos and New York Giants -- Flores alleges that after the regular season, the Giants interviewed him for their vacant head coaching job under disingenuous circumstances, claiming he had found out three days before his interview that the Giants had already decided to hire Brian Daboll. The Giants organization earlier this month issued a statement standing by its process and decision to hire Daboll.Former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores sues NFL and 3 NFL teams alleging racial discrimination""We are pleased and confident with the process that resulted in the hiring of Brian Daboll,"" the team's statement read. ""We interviewed an impressive and diverse group of candidates. The fact of the matter is, Brian Flores was in the conversation to be our head coach until the eleventh hour. Ultimately, we hired the individual we felt was most qualified to be our next head coach.""Flores alleges in his lawsuit that his interview with the Giants was a ruse so the team could ""demonstrate falsely to League Commissioner Roger Goodell and the public at large that it was in compliance with the Rooney Rule.""The NFL instituted the Rooney Rule in 2003 in an effort to increase diversity among the NFL's head coaching, general manager and executive ranks. The rule requires every team to interview at least two external minority candidates for open head coaching positions, according to the NFL's Football Operations website.As of Wednesday, there are only two Black head coaches in the NFL -- Pittsburgh Steelers' Mike Tomlin and Houston Texans' Lovie Smith -- in a league where nearly 70% of the players are Black.JUST WATCHEDEx-NFL coach speaks out about 'humiliating' Bill Belichick textReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEx-NFL coach speaks out about 'humiliating' Bill Belichick text 02:57Three other head coaches of color lead their teams: Washington Commanders' Ron Rivera, who is of Puerto Rican and Mexican descent, New York Jets' Robert Saleh, who is of Lebanese descent, and McDaniel, who is multiracial.Following the announcement of the lawsuit in February, the NFL issued a statement calling Flores' allegations meritless.""The NFL and our clubs are deeply committed to ensuring equitable employment practices and continue to make progress in providing equitable opportunities throughout our organizations,"" the league said in its statement. ""Diversity is core to everything we do, and there are few issues on which our clubs and our internal leadership team spend more time. We will defend against these claims, which are without merit.""Flores alleges he had a 'sham interview' with BroncosFlores' lawsuit makes a claim of another ""sham interview,"" this one with the Denver Broncos in 2019. Flores says that ""Broncos' then-General Manager John Elway, President and Chief Executive Officer Joe Ellis and others showed up an hour late to the interview"" and adds that the Broncos' delegation ""looked completely disheveled, and it was obvious that they had drinking heavily the night before.""The Denver Broncos strongly challenged Flores' lawsuit, saying, ""The allegations from Brian Flores directed toward the Denver Broncos in today's court filing are blatantly false.""JUST WATCHEDEx-NFL coach says owner offered him money to lose gamesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEx-NFL coach says owner offered him money to lose games 03:28""Our process was thorough and fair to determine the most qualified candidate for our head coaching position,"" the team's statement continued. Elway also released a statement rejecting Flores' claims. ""I took Coach Flores very seriously as a candidate for our head coaching position in 2019 and enjoyed our three-and-a-half hour interview with him. Along with the rest of our group, I was prepared, ready and fully engaged during the entire interview as Brian shared his experience and vision for our team,"" Elway's statement this month read. ""For Brian to make an assumption about my appearance and state of mind early that morning was subjective, hurtful and just plain wrong. If I appeared 'disheveled,' as he claimed, it was because we had flown in during the middle of the night -- immediately following another interview in Denver -- and were going on a few hours of sleep to meet the only window provided to us,"" Elway's statement read.Biden says NFL needs to live up to its words on hiring more Black coachesFlores says Dolphins' owner Stephen Ross offered to pay Flores to purposely lose games in order to secure a higher pick in the NFL draft and encouraged Flores to purposely violate league tampering rules. Flores says when he refused, Ross then led a campaign to treat Flores with ""disdain and held out as someone who was noncompliant and difficult to work with.""The Dolphins responded to Flores' allegations, saying in part, ""We vehemently deny any allegations of racial discrimination and are proud of the diversity and inclusion throughout our organization. The implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect. We will be withholding further comment on the lawsuit at this time.""CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report. "
http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnnlatest,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/us-russia-defense-contractors-hackers/index.html,US says Russian hackers have collected intelligence from American defense contractors,"By Sean Lyngaas, CNN","Washington (CNN)Russian government-backed hackers have acquired sensitive information on the development and deployment of US weapons by breaching American defense contractors over the last two years, US security agencies said in a public advisory on Wednesday.  The information gathered is unclassified, but offers ""significant insight into US weapons platforms development and deployment timelines,"" and also covers export-controlled technology, according to the FBI, National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). It's one of the clearest public statements yet from the US government on how Kremlin-linked hackers have gathered intelligence on US defense contractors — a problem Washington has faced for years. The intrusions hit contractors supporting every US military branch, including the Air Force, Army, Navy and Space Force, as well as firms that work on defense and intelligence programs, US officials said. Blinken says US has seen 'no meaningful pullback' of Russian forces from the Ukraine borderThe advisory comes as US officials warn Russia against further invading Ukraine, along whose border Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops, according to US President Joe Biden. Read MoreUS government agencies have for years regularly released information on state-sponsored hacking threats, and US officials continue to say there is no credible, specific cyber threat to the US homeland tied to the Ukraine crisis.Contractors targeted by Russian hackers over the last two years have been involved in aircraft design and the development of combat and weapons systems, among other things, the US agencies said. ""By acquiring proprietary internal documents and email communications, adversaries may be able to adjust their own military plans and priorities, hasten technological development efforts, inform foreign policymakers of US intentions, and target potential sources for recruitment,"" the advisory says. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the US advisory. Russia routinely denies allegations that it conducts hacking operations.""Both the United States and Russia are continually probing, through cyber, to pick up information on weapons systems, on intelligence, etc.,"" Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday when asked about the new US advisory.""The compromise of intelligence information is [on] both sides,"" said Reed, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""And I think we're very well prepared with our cyber operations to assist the Ukrainians.""US Navy aircraft had an 'extremely close' encounter with multiple Russian military jets over the MediterraneanReed said that the US generally has a ""very active cyber operation against Russia. That was demonstrated ... before the 2020 elections, when we literally took out some Russian sites who we knew were interfering with our election.""President Joe Biden said at a January 19 news conference that the US could respond with hacking operations of its own to further Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine. US officials have been publicly and privately advising US critical infrastructure firms for weeks to check their networks for potential Russian hacking threats. Reed said that US Cyber Command, the military's hacking and cyber defense unit, ""is on full alert"" in the event of any escalation from Russia in cyberspace. US spy agencies have long used cyber tools to collect intelligence on rival powers such as Russia and China.  The US National Security Agency looked for ways to exploit products made by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, The New York Times reported in 2014, citing classified documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. This story has been updated with additional details Wednesday."

Thao is one of three officers -- including J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- standing trial in federal court for violating Floyd's civil rights. First of the officers involved in George Floyd's death testifies that using a knee to restrain a subject was a common Minneapolis PD practiceAll three are each charged with deprivation of rights under color of law as Chauvin restrained Floyd. Thao and Kueng are also charged with willfully failing to intervene in Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, resulting in Floyd's death.The three have pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and are being tried together. Chauvin admitted guilt in December as part of a plea deal.Read MoreAll three former officers will face a state trial later this year on charges of aiding and abetting in Floyd's murder.Kueng and Thao told US District Judge Paul Magnuson on Monday they planned to testify in their own defense.Lane, the rookie officer who held down Floyd's legs during the fatal restraint, told the judge Tuesday that he also planned to take the stand. His attorney Earl Gray had told Magnuson a day earlier he wanted to speak with Lane about it before giving a final decision.Kueng is expected to take the stand after Thao.Prosecutor grew frustrated during Thao's testimonyAssistant US Attorney LeeAnn Bell had been pressing Thao on his reasoning for not interfering in Chauvin's handling of Floyd, how often Thao faced toward his fellow officers during the restraint that lead to Floyd's death and whether Thao took any action to assess Floyd's medical condition, including when he was asked to do so by a bystander.""Did you communicate to your partners what you were being told by the bystanders,"" Bell asked. ""No,"" Thao replied.Former Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao is pictured in a courtroom sketch testifying at his trial in the killing of George Floyd on Tuesday, February 15, 2022.Bell also asked Thao if he knew when Floyd stopped breathing, but defense attorney Robert Paule objected to the question. It was one of a dozen objections during Wednesday morning's cross-examination. Bell seemingly became frustrated at the number of times she had to pause and rephrase her questions due to the number of objections. ""Did you hear him talking during the fifth minute or not?"" Bell pressed.""It's a possibility,"" Thao said. When asked if he could confirm if he noticed Floyd's eyes were closed, Thao said he couldn't tell. Bell continued asking Thao about his knowledge of Floyd's medical condition, of which Paule continued to vehemently object. 3 of the officers involved in George Floyd's death will testify during federal civil rights trialDuring redirect, Paule asked Thao why he thought it was necessary to restrain Floyd.Thao said that one of the purposes for restraining Floyd was to protect him from potentially getting up and injuring himself or bystanders, adding the measure was partly done ""to save his life.""""Were your intentions in any way to cause Mr. Floyd harm?"" Paule asked.""Oh no,"" Thao responded.Defense attorneys also called Thao's wife, Sheng Yang, to testify later Wednesday morning. Yang told the jury her husband ""had never gotten into trouble before with the law,"" and that Thao had never even received a parking ticket.After Bell objected to the relevance of the questioning, Judge Magnuson instructed Paule to move on saying ""we aren't going into speeding tickets. I assure you of that.""Thao said using a knee was commonplace in MPDDuring his testimony Tuesday, Thao testified that an officer using their knee to restrain a suspect was taught at the police academy. He also said he assumed other officers were ""taking care"" of Floyd while he was helping control the crowd. Paule showed the jury several photographs from Thao's time in the police academy that pictured instructors using their knees to subdue and arrest subjects during training exercises.Calling one such photo a ""handcuffing drill,"" Thao said it was common practice to be taught how to subdue people in a prone position while using a knee to control the person.""Do you see if those two officers are using their knees?"" Paule asked Thao.""They are,"" Thao responded.One photo showed a use-of-force instructor smiling while his knee is on the neck of the subject in the exercise.""Is this something that was typically taught at the academy while you were there?"" Paule continued.""Yes,"" Thao responded.Former Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao testified that it was not uncommon to see other police officers use their knees while arresting someone.When asked why a knee would be used in the exercises, Thao said it was ""to prevent them from rolling around or get up.""During the incident that led to Floyd's death, Thao testified that even though he had been waived off from responding to the scene after other officers had arrived, he decided to continue assisting.""From my experience, Cup Foods is hostile to police,"" he told the jury. ""It's a well-known Bloods gang hangout.""Thao said he thought ""it was obvious"" Floyd was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, partly because he was ""very sweaty.""As the scene grew more tense and chaotic, Thao testified his role shifted to becoming a ""human traffic cone,"" ensuring that cars would not hit the officers and the ambulance that had been called could easily spot them.""I knew the crowd was starting to gather up and cause issues,"" Thao said. ""At that point, I have a different role, which is to do crowd control to allow them to attend to Mr. Floyd.""Juror dismissed due to stomach fluA juror was dismissed Wednesday because they contracted the stomach flu or had eaten something and as a result is ill,"" Judge Magnuson said. The juror was one of the five alternates, court spokeswoman Rebeccah Parks confirmed to CNN.The 12 juror panel is still comprised of five men and seven women. There are now four alternates, one man and three women.This is the second juror to be dismissed in the case. Last week a juror was released after disclosing that his son is dealing with a serious mental health issue. "

""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war,"" the official said.The new estimates would place the number of Russian forces north of the 150,000 figure President Joe Biden cited in a televised address earlier this week. Western leaders had already greeted Russia's claims of withdrawal with skepticism. On Tuesday, Biden said during a speech in the East Room that a withdrawal of Russian troops would be ""good,"" but that he had yet to see any evidence that such a pullback was underway. ""Our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position,"" Biden said. ""And the fact remains right now Russia has more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine and Belarus and along Ukraine's border.""Read MoreIn this photo taken from video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday, Russian armored vehicles are loaded onto railway platforms after the end of military drills in South Russia. The senior official again warned Russia could use a false pretext for an attack, including making claims about NATO activity or an incursion into Russian territory, or alleging atrocities were occurring in the eastern Donbas region, which has been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014.""We should expect more false reports from Russian state media over the coming days,"" the official said. ""We don't know what form the false pretext will take. But we hope the world is ready.""The announcements, delivered on an early evening briefing call, painted a stark picture as the US and Europe wait on tenterhooks for Putin to signal his intentions. American officials have said the window is open for a potential invasion but that the enigmatic Russian leader will still need to make the final decision.A day earlier, Biden had seized on signals from Moscow that it is willing to resume negotiations, saying there was ""plenty of room for diplomacy."" But the official speaking a day later largely discounted those prospects while still saying talks would continue.""We will continue to pursue diplomacy over the coming days while being prepared to respond swiftly and decisively,"" the official said. ""Russia keeps saying it wants to pursue a diplomatic solution; their actions indicate otherwise. We hope they will change course before starting a war that will bring catastrophic death and destruction.""On Tuesday, Putin claimed Russia was sending some troops back to base after completing drills in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014.But US and European leaders uniformly cast doubt on the claim.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had not yet seen ""any sign of de-escalation on the ground,"" but added that ""signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue"" were grounds for cautious optimism.The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a news conference in Kyiv that he was abiding by a rule when it comes to Russian claims: ""Do not hear and then believe. But do see and then believe.""And US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a morning interview Wednesday there is ""a difference between what Russia says and what it does.""""What we're seeing is no meaningful pullback,"" Blinken told ABC News.This story has been updated with more reporting."
http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnnlatest,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/europe/putin-pretext-war-hodge-analysis-intl/index.html,Is Putin creating a pretext for war? ,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN ","Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin is a man who likes to keep his options open, and the Ukraine crisis is no exception: As the Kremlin leader signals his willingness to engage on the diplomatic front, he is also bolstering a case for war.    Take the situation in Donbas, the territories in eastern Ukraine partly controlled by Russian-backed separatists. In a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, Putin dropped the ""g"" word to describe the situation there.   ""According to our estimates, what is happening in the Donbas today is genocide,"" Putin said.  Scholz pushed back, later telling reporters that Putin was ""wrong"" to use the term. But those comments were already out in the public realm -- and Putin had stepped up the rhetoric.Putin's grievance in the Donbas isn't new. He has spoken repeatedly about what he describes as the violation of the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, and has stated that it is within Russia's rights to intervene militarily to protect them.   Read MoreBut Putin appears to be making a case for his own version of a ""responsibility to protect,"" however distant the situation in Donbas may be from a Rwanda -- where over 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were killed over the course of 100 days in 1994 -- or Srebrenica -- where more than 7,000 mostly Muslim men and boys were slaughtered in 1995. Russian buildup continues, but insufficient for full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence says Invoking genocide echoes Russia's false claim that its neighbor, Georgia, committed genocide against civilians in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia in August 2008. During that brief conflict, Russia launched a massive military incursion that pushed deep into Georgian territory, a scenario that worries Western policymakers today when it comes to Ukraine.  The Investigative Committee, Russia's top law enforcement body, took Putin's comments a step further on Wednesday when it announced it had opened a criminal investigation into alleged evidence of what it called ""indiscriminate shelling"" of civilians in the Donbas region by Ukrainian forces since 2014. In a press release laced with politically charged language, the Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal case under Part 1 of Article 356 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which covers mistreatment of the civilian population and the use of means and methods prohibited by an international treaty in an armed conflict.

It's clear why the Kremlin wants to change the subject: Back in 2015, for instance, shelling blamed on Russian-backed Donbas separatists claimed the lives of at least 30 people in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.Since conflict in the Donbas began in 2014, thousands of civilians have been killed and injured in the fighting, according to United Nations estimates. But announcing an investigation -- not by an independent body, and at the height of a confrontation with Ukraine -- appears to be a clearly political move, whatever the truth of the allegations.  And then there's also the nettlesome question of the legal status of the separatist regions of Donbas. Russia has never recognized the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), in the Donbas, as sovereign and independent states, even as it has handed out Russian passports to people living there. Russian lawmakers earlier this week appealed to the Russian President to recognize the breakaway republics in Donbas as independent. That, too, creates a potential situation where Russia might declare the need to respond to Ukrainian ""aggression"" against those statelets.  Would that happen? Recognition of the DNR and LNR would effectively scuttle the Minsk agreements, a package of measures that, for now, the Kremlin says is the only way to resolve the Ukraine crisis.  But manufacturing more problems can also benefit the Kremlin: It expands the menu of options at Putin's disposal.   "

A senior official said late Wednesday that Russia had massed another 7,000 troops on the Ukrainian border in recent days, despite the Kremlin's claims that some forces had returned to base in remarks seen as an opening for diplomacy.""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war,"" the official said, reiterating that Russia could fake an incident as a pretext to attack using what President Joe Biden said Tuesday was around 150,000 troops.The new US claims represented the latest gambit in a highly unusual public relations campaign using declassified intelligence meant to remove the element of surprise from Putin and to deprive Moscow of the usual advantage it secures with its mastery of misinformation tactics. Inside Washington, there are few who doubt government claims Putin is ready to invade at any time. But the intensity of US warnings over a period of weeks may soon raise the question of how long Biden can maintain the state of alert, and whether the continued lack of an invasion despite ever-more alarming warnings could open gaps between NATO allies -- and between the US and Ukrainian governments. Such stresses would play directly into Putin's long-term strategic goals. Read MoreBoth the US and Russia, the world's two greatest nuclear powers, say they are ready to negotiate. But they remain far apart on Putin's demands to rip up existing security arrangements in Eastern Europe with the departure of NATO troops from former Warsaw Pact nations.  The US' game is not without risk, since it might push Putin over the edge -- especially if, as some US officials suspect, he's increasingly prone to a bunker mentality and getting little outside advice and perspective from officials willing to challenge his views.Waiting on Putin's next move  By definition, in combat waged with propaganda and dueling information, it's hard to know what is really going on.At this point it's impossible to judge whether the US is genuinely flushing out preparations for an invasion or whether it is taking Putin's bait by exposing troop movements he is ordering in the knowledge that they'll be highlighted by Washington, and therefore increase the sense of insecurity in Europe and anxiety over what he might do next.The showdown over Ukraine has become the most serious geopolitical confrontation in Europe since the end of the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union.The US will not send troops to Ukraine to directly fight Russians. But Biden has rushed forces to reinforce US NATO allies in Eastern Europe. Putin is effectively holding Ukraine, a sovereign, democratic nation, hostage to demand the western alliance pull back from ex-Soviet satellite states like Poland, Romania and Hungary. And if Russia does march into Ukraine, there could be painful consequences for Americans back home, with rising gas prices and energy prices adding to existing inflationary misery.The new US warning about secret Russian maneuvers came amid quickening efforts to keep up Western pressure on Moscow. The White House announced that Vice President Kamala Harris will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference this weekend. The forum, also due to be attended by leading European officials and US lawmakers, is turning into a rallying point for the US and its allies as the NATO alliance faces its most serious test since the fall of the Soviet Union.""We are in a very decisive moment,"" the senior US official said, previewing the most high-profile foreign policy mission for the vice president so far.This week has seen some hope that the crisis could be easing after Russia announced some of its troops were moving away from the border. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken instead Wednesday told ABC News there had been no ""meaningful pullback"" and that Putin could ""pull the trigger"" at any time.""He could pull it today. He could pull it tomorrow. He could pull it next week,"" Blinken said.Putin plays the long gameBut in a fresh sign of discord between the US and Ukraine itself, an intelligence report in Kyiv shown to CNN insisted that the current Russian troop build-up is not enough for a ""successful large-scale armed aggression against Ukraine.""The differing assessments played into the uncertainty and confusion that characteristic of Putin's Machiavellian methods. The Russian leader has observers split between those who believe he is merely seeking to destabilize the government in Ukraine, assert Russian power and assail the Western alliance and those convinced an invasion that could spell a dangerous new era in Europe is imminent.Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that the Russian leader's intentions were almost certainly nefarious. ""I think they are running a disinformation campaign,"" McCaul said. The daunting truth is that while there will be questions of troop readiness, Putin can keep the campaign of pressure up almost indefinitely. In doing so, he could show Ukraine he will never allow it to join the European Union or NATO, dig divisions among Western allies and make a point that Russia must never be ignored again when it comes to security arrangements on the European continent. The crisis has also fulfilled another goal -- as a stream of leaders and diplomats has traveled to Moscow and Putin has spoken frequently to Biden, restoring Russia's image as a great power, following years in which the US minimized its threat and built its foreign policy around confronting China.Even if he doesn't invade, the Russian President has the capacity to turn up the heat any time he feels Russia is not being respected. And days and weeks of prolonging the showdown could discredit US claims an invasion is imminent, weaken Western resolve and restore to Russia its element of surprise. In a long-term showdown, Russia would have the advantage because it cares far more about the fate of Ukraine, a former Soviet federated state, than the West does. While this confrontation lacks the breadth and intensity of the Cold War, when Europe was divided by an Iron Curtain into free nations protected by the US and communist states dominated by Moscow, a geopolitical shift does seem to be taking shape with the possibility for another ossified confrontation.Putin has been in power for more than 20 years, outlasted multiple US presidents and doesn't play by the four-year clock between elections that dominates American politics. He is also willing to subject the Russian people -- who have endured a grueling history -- to more pain than a US President worried about reelection would countenance for theirs. It's one reason why some experts believe he may be willing to risk the withering sanctions that would be triggered by an invasion.'The new normal' NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will also meet Harris in Munich, fueled perceptions of more contentious era dawning in Eastern Europe that mirrored old Cold War divides.""I regret to say this is the new normal in Europe,"" Stoltenberg said in Brussels. ""We do not know what will happen in Ukraine. But the situation has already demonstrated we face a crisis in European security. Moscow has made it clear that it is prepared to contest the fundamental principles that have underpinned our security for decades and do so by using force,"" he added.The fact that the West will gather in Munich to steel itself for new confrontations is ironic since it was at the conference 15 years ago that Putin launched a savage attack on the US and the post-Cold War order that in retrospect was a playbook for his tactics culminating in the Ukraine crisis.The Russian leader bemoaned an era of ""unipolar"" American power at a time when the US was fighting wars of choice in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also lashed out at NATO expansion to include ex-Soviet satellite nations -- the underlying cause of his belief that the West is threatening Russia and that he must prevent Ukraine from falling further under its influence. ""We have the right to ask: Against whom is this expansion intended?"" he said, while hinting at a campaign of ""many years and decades, as well as several generations of politicians"" that would redress the balance.For those who recall his Munich tirade, none of Putin's hard, hostile turn against the United States, his incursion into Georgia, the annexation of Crimea, interventions in US elections and current thuggery toward Ukraine are a surprise.Washington might think it won the Cold War 30 years ago. But recent weeks show the Russian leader is still waging something very much like it, because it is a way to demand respect for his country's power, status and goals.This story has been updated."

Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/sport/womens-figure-skating-scoring-explainer/index.html,Here's how women's figure skating is now scored (and why stamina often leads to more points),"By Holly Yan, CNN"," (CNN)Gone are the days when Olympic figure skating was scored solely at the judges' discretion, with subjective points awarded on a 6.0 scale.A 2002 Olympic figure skating scandal -- with allegations of score-fixing -- upended the sport and led to a complete overhaul of the scoring system -- one that awards more points for stamina and strenuous athletic feats. Now, another Olympic skating controversy has gripped die-hard and casual fans alike. Gold-medal favorite Kamila Valieva, 15, gave a test sample that later tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine on December 25, the day she won the Russian national championship.Russian skating star Kamila Valieva cleared to skate at Beijing GamesTrimetazidine is a medication that can increase stamina and make ""your heart work more efficiently,"" said  Dr. Elizabeth Murray, pediatric emergency medicine physician at the University of Rochester Medical Center.Read MoreBut the positive result wasn't announced by the World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited Swedish lab until February 8, a day after Valieva and her Russian Olympic Committee teammates won gold in the team competition. An Olympic official said Valieva blamed the positive test on a mix-up with her grandfather's medication. The skater's coach, Eteri Tutberidze, told Russian state news agency Tass her entourage is ""absolutely sure"" she is innocent.Valieva was allowed to compete for more gold in the Olympic women's individual figure skating event. Her routine for the free skate -- the final portion of the women's competition -- features quadruple jumps that are untouchable by most of her competitors. Here's how the sport has evolved in recent years to reward increased athleticism and stamina: More difficult jumps = more pointsIn 2004, the International Skating Union ditched the subjective ""6.0"" scoring system for the more rubric-based International Judging System that gives certain base points for jumps depending on their degree of difficulty and how many times the skater rotates in the air.Kamila Valieva competes for the first time since a controversial doping scandal rulingFor example, a quadruple Lutz -- in which a skater makes four revolutions in the air -- carries more base points than a triple Lutz. But a triple Lutz carries more base points than less difficult triples, such as a triple loop or a triple Salchow. After each jump, skaters can gain or lose points from the base value depending on the grade of execution -- how well or poorly they executed the jump.All those numbers are part of the technical score. There's also the presentation score, which rewards artistry and skating skills between jumps. But in recent years, skaters have been able to win competitions largely due to points racked up from jumping -- with quadruple jumps playing a larger role in men's and women's skating. Why better stamina can win skaters more pointsIn women's figure skating, athletes perform two routines: the short program, which is about 2 minutes and 40 seconds long, and the free skate, which is about 4 minutes long. Russian skater Alina Zagitova was 15 when she won Olympic gold after performing all her free skate jumps in the second half of the routine.With the current scoring system, jumps performed in the second half of the free skate can get a 10% bonus because it's more difficult to perform them on tired legs. 2018 Olympic champion Alina Zagitova, who was also coached by Tutberidze, capitalized on this and put all her triple jumps in the second half of her free skate. The 15-year-old Russian won Olympic gold and was celebrated by President Vladimir Putin. Russian President Vladimir Putin presents Alina Zagitova with an Order of Friendship following the Russian teen's Olympic win in 2018.But critics denounced Zagitova's method of winning, saying the teen's performance lacked artistry or relied too heavily on jumps crammed in the second half of the routine to maximize points. After the widespread criticism in 2018, the International Skating Union created a new rule saying skaters will only get 10% bonuses for up to three jumping passes in the second half of their free skate. The new rule has been dubbed the ""Zagitova rule."" Since the last Olympics, women's figure skating has been dominated by Russian teenagers such as Kamila Valieva, Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova. Even if Kamila Valieva wins, she losesAll three have won international championships after adding quadruple jumps in their routines -- an enormous athletic feat.Valieva became the first individual female skater to land a quad at the Olympics when she helped Russian skaters win the team event last week. But if Valieva places first after the women's final, she might not get an Olympic medal around her neck for a while -- if at all.  The International Olympic Committee's executive board said this week that there would be no medal ceremonies for the completed team event or the women's skating competition -- should Valieva place in the top three in that event -- until it's determined whether the skater had violated anti-doping regulations.CNN's Simone McCarthy, Hannah Ritchie and George Ramsay contributed to this report.

Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/uk/prince-andrew-sex-abuse-case-analysis-intl-gbr/index.html,Prince Andrew has settled with the woman who accused him of sex abuse. Where does he go from here?,"Analysis by Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Max Foster, CNN","This is a special edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here to receive our newsletter every Friday.  London (CNN)And just like that it's all over. Britain's Prince Andrew, the Queen's second son, has reached a deal with Virginia Giuffre to settle her civil sex abuse lawsuit against him. Giuffre alleges she was trafficked by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and forced to perform sex acts with his friends, including the senior royal. She also said the Duke of York had been aware she was underage in the US at the time. Giuffre brought the case last August under the Child Victims Act, a state law enacted in New York in 2019 which temporarily extended the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases, giving survivors more time to seek justice. Andrew, 61, repeatedly rejected the allegations against him. Just weeks ago, his lawyers had demanded a jury trial to clear their client's name. But now the looming courtroom showdown is off. On Tuesday, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed figure. Read MoreIn a letter to federal Judge Lewis Kaplan, the parties stated that while the full financial terms of the agreement would not be revealed, ""Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights.""According to the court document filed by Giuffre's attorneys, the parties plan to file a stipulation of dismissal of the case within 30 days. So, with news of the case's pending conclusion, let's unpack a few things. Andrew has claimed to have no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre or of posing for the infamous photo showing the royal with his arm around the teenager. A photograph appearing to show Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre and, in the background, Ghislaine Maxwell.His lawyers have spent months trying to undermine Giuffre, arguing her claims were motivated by money. They wrote in a blistering court filing in October that: ""Giuffre has initiated this baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense.""And while Andrew neither confirmed nor denied Giuffre's claims in Tuesday's court filing, he has now agreed to a likely multi-million dollar settlement with a woman who leveled grave accusations of sexual abuse against the senior royal. UK newspapers twisted the knife on Wednesday with numerous headlines suggesting the deal amounted to anywhere between £10 and 12 million ($13-$16 million). The Daily Mail splashed with ""Duke's final '£10 million humiliation,"" The Sun newspaper ran with ""His final disgrace,"" while The Daily Telegraph reported ""Queen to help pay for £12m settlement.""Questions over how Andrew will foot the bill remain. There have been suggestions that the Queen may contribute -- but that could be damaging for the monarch, were it ever to be confirmed. To date, the Queen has largely avoided becoming the target of public anger over the saga that has engulfed her son. She remains revered, and 'the firm' has gone to great lengths to distance itself from the civil suit.The Queen and her son chat at the Windsor Horse Show in 2017.A closer look at the phrasing of the document is also revealing. It states that ""Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.""His team is now recognizing her trauma and praising her bravery at coming forward.""Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others,"" the document continues.Royals hope for jubilee reset after tumultuous 12 months One of the big criticisms of Prince Andrew has been over his lack of empathy for Epstein's victims. Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, had provided a view of the case from her perspective in January when he told the BBC it was important to his client that the matter ""be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims."" Sigrid McCawley, another attorney for Giuffre, said Tuesday that she was ""very pleased with the resolution"" of the lawsuit. Then there's the question of why this has happened now. The settlement comes at a crucial juncture in the case, as it moved into the discovery stage, during which both sides could demand disclosure of documents and the parties involved would have had to sit for depositions. Andrew was less than a month away from having to give a statement under oath to Giuffre's lawyers, who were reportedly planning to fly to London to question him in person. If ever there was a moment to strike a deal, this was it.Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein (far right) pictured together at the Ascot horse races.CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson says it was ""a significant development and off ramp"" for the duke as with litigation ""you always will have revelations that occur.""""In depositions, for example, where you raise your hand and you swear to tell the truth ... in the event that he perjures himself, he opens himself up to some other issues and then obviously it stays in the news,"" he continues.""Not to mention a legal perspective, where after depositions, after discovery, and you go to court and you could lose, and that's when all types of details may come out that you may not want.""Jackson thinks the duke was left without any option other than to settle, since letting the case drag on ""would do him no good nor anyone else related to him any good.""""I think this was the best option to explore and ultimately to take,"" he adds.However, the end of the lawsuit doesn't mean we'll see the ninth-in-line to the British throne returning to public duties anytime soon. For the former naval officer, that ship has well and truly sailed. His handling of the crisis since Giuffre's allegations first emerged years ago has left his reputation in tatters. The court of public opinion designated him persona non grata after that car-crash interview with the BBC in 2019, during which he was coy about his years-long friendship with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. He said he was at a pizza parlor on the night it is alleged that he had sex with Giuffre. He also said he was medically incapable of sweating, countering allegations from Giuffre that he had perspired profusely before they had sex in 2001, when she was 17. A settlement leaves many of the issues raised in that interview unresolved.And it's important to note that the recently convicted Maxwell is now facing life in prison for sex trafficking. Legal experts say prosecutors could consider continuing their work investigating the crimes of the British socialite and Epstein to determine whether others should be charged -- especially if she decides to cooperate.Prince Andrew has kept a low profile since stepping back from public duties as a senior royal.These days the prince spends much of his time on the Windsor estate and is often surrounded by photographers when he attempts to leave his home. Analysis: Queen left with no choice but to cast Prince Andrew adrift. But is it enough?A Buckingham Palace spokesperson told CNN the palace would not be commenting on the latest developments in the case on Tuesday, once again saying it was a matter for the Duke and his legal team. But the settlement will likely be welcomed within the palace since it means the court case will no longer cast a shadow over the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer. The family has gone to great lengths to distance itself from the scandal surrounding Andrew, with the Queen stripping him of his HRH status as well as his royal patronages and affiliations last month, to make it clear his exile from the royal frontline was permanent.It's worth noting that Andrew still has a constitutional role. He remains a Counsellor of State -- and along with Charles, William and Harry -- could be called on to pick up some of the Queen's duties if she were temporarily incapacitated due to illness or if she was traveling. Street art featuring Prince Andrew is seen in the Shoreditch area of London on July 1, 2020.Andrew's relinquishment of his public-facing royal role doesn't change his counsellor status -- it would take an act of parliament to revoke that.How the prince will move on from this remains to be seen. The carefully-crafted settlement letter states that: ""He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims."" That suggests he might become some sort of campaigner for sex abuse survivors -- but reputation management experts have previously expressed doubt over Andrew's ability to repair his image. And it is unclear just how welcome any offer of help from him would be to charities or support groups.While the prospect of an embarrassing public trial is off the table, by settling he has failed to clear his name, and the damage to his reputation has been done.

In a letter to the National Archives, White House counsel Dana Remus wrote Biden has determined that asserting executive privilege ""is not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified, as to these records and portions of records."" The New York Times was first to report on Biden's decision.National Archives seeks Justice Department investigation of Trump's handling of White House documentsThe National Archives provided these documents to the current White House for review in late January, and they include ""visitor logs showing appointment information for individuals who were processed to enter the White House complex, including on January 6, 2021."" Remus explained the administration's decision by noting that, while Trump decided to block the visitor logs from public view on claims about national security, the Biden administration ""voluntarily discloses such visitor logs on a monthly basis,"" with some exceptions.""The Obama administration followed the same practice. The majority of the entries over which the former President has asserted executive privilege would be publicly released under current policy,"" Remus wrote. Read MoreFollowing on the letter from Remus, the National Archives sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday informing him that they would be disclosing presidential records that the former President had argued were privileged, including White House visitor logs, to the select committee. David Ferriero, the archivist of the United States, wrote in the letter that the documents would be delivered to the select committee on March 3. ""To ensure that Executive Branch interests are adequately protected, the Select Committee has agreed to treat entries associated with appointments designated as national-security sensitive (NSS) or otherwise-highly sensitive (OHS) as confidential and to refrain from sharing or discussing such entries outside the Select Committee without prior consultation,"" Ferriero wrote. ""Moreover, to ensure that personal privacy information is not inadvertently disclosed, the Select Committee has agreed to accept production of these records with birthdates and social security numbers removed.""It remains unclear how detailed the visitor logs were under the Trump administration or what the documents could reveal to the committee.White House visitor logs are compiled from information submitted by individuals who have made an appointment to visit the White House, but the extent to which they can reveal the inner workings of the building can be limited.Anyone without a permanent pass to enter the complex -- which includes the White House itself but also several adjacent office buildings -- must submit personal details to be cleared in. Usually, an assistant in the office they are visiting handles the process through the White House Worker and Visitor Entry System (dubbed WAVES).In submitting the clearance information, details are included like who the appointment is with, what date and time it is scheduled for, and where on the complex it is to take place, down to the room number. The Secret Service processes the information, and officers check it against the visitor's ID when they arrive at one of the White House gates.That is where visibility derived from the logs ends. If a visitor is cleared in to meet with one individual, but ends up meeting with other officials, that would not appear in the logs. If the person shows up at a different time, or doesn't show up at all, the entry would still be included with the original time and date. While the entry may show a visitor scheduled for a meeting in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, it is possible they ended up in the Oval Office -- escorted by someone who works in the building.Similarly, records of who visits the White House residence can be limited. While those visitors would also be required to submit their information through the WAVES system, both the Obama and Biden administrations excluded visitors deemed ""purely personal guests of the First and Second Families (i.e., visits that do not involve any official or political business)"" from their voluntary disclosure. Citing the committee's need for information, Remus writes that Biden is also instructing the National Archives to provide these documents 15 days after its notification to the former President, ""unless prohibited by court order. If the 15-day period expires on a weekend or holiday, you should provide the records to the Select Committee on the next business day.""Why the Donald Trump-National Archives story is such a big dealRemus also notes the committee has agreed to treat such entries associated with appointments designated as national-security sensitive (""NSS"") or otherwise-highly sensitive (""OHS"") ""as confidential and to refrain from sharing or discussing such entries outside the Select Committee without prior consultation.""Previously, Trump tried to keep secret ""appointment information showing visitors to the White House,"" according to court records in his executive privilege fight that went to the Supreme Court. The House ultimately won access to those records, which made up fewer than 30 pages.Last month, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the release of presidential records from the Trump White House to the congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack. The select committee has been gathering information from hundreds of witnesses and communications providers as it examines the events leading up to the insurrection when hundreds of rioters converged on the Capitol attempting to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election results. Assessing Trump's risk if he mishandled White House documentsThe select committee is seeking more than 700 pages of disputed documents as it explores Trump's role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. This includes Trump's appearance at a rally on January 6 in which he directed followers to go to the US Capitol where lawmakers were set to certify the election results and ""fight"" for their county.The documents the select committee is seeking include activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. These documents could shed light on the events leading up to the insurrection and reveal what was happening inside of the West Wing as Trump supporters overran the US Capitol. The Supreme Court's order effectively moots Trump's pending appeal in the case that centered on keeping the documents secret. Lawyers for Trump say the documents are sensitive and privileged records.This story has been updated with additional information.CNN's Ariane de Vogue, Katelyn Polantz and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.

Justice Minister Judit Varga said Brussels was abusing its powers against national member states.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference: ""Poland believes that centralization, bureaucratic centralization, federalization... is a dangerous process.""The EU has already frozen pandemic recovery funds worth 36 billion euros ($41 billion) for Poland and 7 billion euros for Hungary. The so-called ""conditionality mechanism"" could now affect any part of the EU budget, worth 1.8 trillion euros ($2 trillion) for 2021-27.Poland, the biggest formerly communist EU member with 38 million people, is eligible for more than 75 billion euros through 2027, including for climate, digitalization and public health. Hungary has a population around a quarter the size but has received an even greater share of EU spending per capita.Poland ignites EU anger with ruling that its laws supersede bloc's treaties""Hungary and Poland have been rapidly backsliding on media freedom, independence of judges, the right to protest,"" said Amnesty International. ""Instead of trying to oppose EU funds being conditional on respect for the rule of law, they should respect people's rights and clean up their act.""EU officials said the bloc might move on Hungary first, while political horse-trading would probably delay a decision to withhold funds at least until late this year.Poland and Hungary have threatened to retaliate by stalling other EU decisions that require unanimity, including on climate and energy, as well as foreign policy.Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told Reuters that the dispute would not lead Hungary to block an EU-Africa summit later this week or interfere with any potential sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.Katalin Cseh, a liberal Hungarian EU lawmaker, said ignoring the erosion of the rule of law in Poland and Hungary would be comparable to the dark comedy film ""Don't Look Up"", in which politicians fail to stop an asteroid from destroying the Earth.""If we are sitting tight and assessing, then Mr Orban and Mr Morawiecki would achieve their goal of destroying the Union from within,"" she said.

At the time, she was believed to have been abducted by her noncustodial parents, Kimberly Cooper and Kirk Shultis Jr., police said in a news release. Paislee and her mother were found Monday when investigators spotted ""a pair of tiny feet"" in a secret space under wooden steps leading to a basement. ""We should all wait until the facts come out,"" said Carol K. Morgan, who represents Cooper. ""Everyone should be patient before they draw their own conclusions."" In the basement of the house, detectives searching for the girl found an apartment, including a bedroom with Paislee's name on a wall, Saugerties Police Chief Joseph Sinagra told CNN on Wednesday. The bed appeared to have been slept in. Read More""Our officers asked, 'Is she here?' ... And they denied that anybody was living in that house, in that particular room,"" the chief said in an interview. ""They said they had set the room up like that in the event that Paislee should ever return.""Paislee Joann Shultis in a photo released by the Saugerties Police Department. Throughout the 2.5-year investigation, authorities received several tips about the Saugerties-area home where the child was eventually located -- but each time, the residents denied knowing anything about the girl's whereabouts, the release said. Saugerties is about 160 miles east of Cayuga Heights. ""The quick answer: That's our criminal justice system,"" Sinagra said of his department's inability to find the girl earlier, adding that Monday was the first time officers were able to obtain factual information -- not hearsay -- and secure a search warrant.Sinagra said the homeowners were always ""adversarial"" with the officers, accusing police of ""harassing"" and ""badgering"" them and ""insisting we should be out looking for Paislee.""Sinagra told CNN on Wednesday that officers previously had been in the home roughly a dozen times but were not allowed in the basement or bedroom areas. ""We're bothered by the fact that this went on for two years,"" the chief said. ""They lied to us for two years -- including the father stating that he had no idea where his daughter was.""On several occasions, investigators were allowed into the home without a warrant, but they were given ""limited access"" by Kirk Shultis Jr. and Kirk Shultis Sr., police said in the news release.That changed Monday when police received information the child was being hidden and got a warrant for the home. Officers arrived outside the house about 4 p.m to ensure that no one left. Police then executed the warrant a little after 8 p.m., the chief said. The homeowner denied knowing the girl's whereabouts, saying he had not seen her since she was reported missing in 2019. Police said the secret location underneath the stairs to the basement appeared to have been built to hide the girl.Something peculiar in a staircaseAn hour into the search, one detective noticed the steps leading to the basement were oddly constructed. The detective, Erik Thiele, pointed a flashlight through a crack in the wooden steps and saw what seemed to be a blanket, the release said.""There was something about the staircase that bothered him,"" Sinagra said of the officer who discovered the hidden compartment. As officers began to pull the stairs apart, Sinagra said the silence was eerie. ""The child never made a sound. Kimberly never made a sound,"" Sinagra said. ""The question that needs to be answered is what she was told by her parents that would keep her so still and quiet while the cops are walking up and down the steps, while they're taking the steps apart,"" Sinagra added.Investigators removed several of the steps, the release added, and ""that is when detectives saw a pair of tiny feet."" A door in Paislee's basement room opened onto a short hallway that led directly to the secret compartment under the stairs -- about three to four feet away, Sinagra said. ""The child and her abductor, Kimberly Cooper were found hiding in the dark and wet enclosure,"" the police release said.  Authorities believe Cooper and the child had been staying at the home since they disappeared in 2019, Sinagra said, adding the staircase appeared to have been built to hide them both. ""It is our opinion ... that, that location was used probably each and every time that we sent an officer to the residence,"" Sinagra said. Police arrested Cooper and Shultis Jr. -- the girl's biological parents -- as well as Shultis Sr., the release said. Missing Children Fast FactsCooper was charged with two misdemeanors: custodial interference in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child, and remains in jail because of a prior arrest warrant issued through family court, according to police.Kirk Shultis Jr. and Kirk Shultis Sr. were each charged with custodial interference in the first degree, a felony, and endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor. Both were arraigned and released on their own recognizance, police said. All three defendants were ordered by the court to stay away from the child. Cooper, who made bail, and the two men appeared in court Wednesday.The cases for the men were adjourned to later this month. Their lawyers declined comment. Cooper will be back in court March 2. The child was found to be in good health and released to her legal guardian and reunited with her older sister, police said. On Tuesday, ""detectives met with the family that has the child, and she was in very good spirits,"" the chief said. One last stop: A McDonald's drive-thruThe young girl was ""upset and was concerned"" when police first rescued her, Sinagra said. ""That begs the question, what was the child told about the police and, you know, why the police would come and take her,"" Sinagra said. ""That's what I'm concerned about. ... And I'm sure that when she saw several of our officers, who were heavily armed ... that was somewhat traumatizing to the child.""Before she was released to her legal guardian, detectives drove the girl to police headquarters, in part so medics could examine her. As they drove, she saw a McDonald's and recalled having some a long time ago, the chief said. ""So, the detectives turned the car around and went to the drive-through at McDonald's, picked her up a Happy Meal, and brought her back to headquarters. And she was fine after that,"" the chief added. An investigation is ongoing, police said. ""We don't know what Paislee lived (through) for the past two years,"" Sinagra said. ""And we don't know what kind of damage may have been done because of the conditions that she had to live under.""CNN's Jessica Prater and Kiely Westhoff contributed to this report."

Prosecuting attorney Jessica Berliner says Jones is currently imprisoned for murdering a man in 1995 in California, and online records show he is not eligible for parole in that state until 2030. ""The defendant bound Stacy Falcon-Dewey, beat her, orally raped her and likely shot her child to death in front of her before killing her. The extraordinary violence and cruelty of these murders demonstrates the extreme danger he presents to society,"" the court documents said.Colorado police solve four decades-old homicide cold cases with DNA from exhumed killerVianne Falcon, Falcon-Dewey's mother, told CNN affiliate KING on Wednesday that she was emotionally devastated by the loss of her daughter and grandson.Read More""I couldn't believe it,"" she said, referring to the day police told her about the killings. ""And I went running down the street like a wild woman until I found a place I could just collapse and cry.""If convicted, Jones would face a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, the documents said.Jones' arraignment is slated for March 1, according to the Superior Court clerk's office. CNN has reached out to Karim Merchant, Jones' public defender, for comment.How police solved the caseThe bodies of Falcon-Dewey and her son were discovered on October 28, 1994, after a Seattle Times newspaper delivery person called 911 and reported seeing the mother's body, according to a probable cause document. When the officers arrived, they found the pair lying in the middle of the roadway next to the mother's car, both shot in the head, the document said. The gun used in the killings has not been recovered. He spent two decades in prison for church murders. New DNA evidence shows someone else did itPolice say there was a struggle at the scene, based on the evidence collected. ""For instance, some of the contents of Stacy's purse were strewn about the vehicle including her wallet. The keys to the car appeared to have been dropped between the driver's seat and the door and were not readily visible,"" the document says. An initial connection to Jones was established in 2002 through DNA evidence, according to the document. In an interview with the suspect in a California prison, Jones confirmed he lived near Renton from 1994-1995 but denied ever meeting or knowing Falcon-Dewey, the document said. Over the subsequent years, additional evidence was submitted for DNA testing -- and a significant advance was made in December 2021 when DNA traces linked to Jones were found on a jacket worn by Jacob Dewey at the time of his killing, the document said. The prior DNA connection between the suspect and swabs taken from Falcon-Dewey was also confirmed, it said."
Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/middleeast/mideast-summary-02-16-2022-intl/index.html,Why the US may find itself forced back into the Middle East  ,"By Abbas Al Lawati, Nadeen Ebrahim and Eoin McSweeney, CNN","Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN)Perceived disengagement by the United States in the Middle East has led to a strategic shift in regional priorities of late. Alarms about the withering of America's security umbrella perhaps rang loudest in Arab capitals after a 2019 attack on the heart of the Saudi economy prompted a reaction from Washington that was whimpering at best. The thinking was that if Donald Trump, arguably the US President  closest to Gulf states to date, couldn't help them, then no American administration would. The US was seen as abandoning the Middle East. Blamed on Iran, the brazen predawn attack on state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco's facilities knocked off half of Saudi crude output, sending oil prices climbing 19.5%, the most on record. Historically, an unwritten agreement between America and its oil producing Arab allies stipulated that the US would provide protection in return for a steady supply of crude to the global economy from a region that is home to more than two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves. The US has often leaned on the Gulf states to adjust output if the price of a barrel doesn't suit its economic interests, and Arab states have often obliged. Read MoreBut Arab concern about the unraveling of this arrangement has led to stubbornness when it comes to Arab oil policy and, perhaps more importantly, it has prompted some countries to address the very sources of threats to their security. A drone attack in Abu Dhabi could mark a dangerous turning point for the Middle East. Here's what to knowThe United Arab Emirates, which had been militarily active in several regional hotspots, last summer opted to steer its foreign policy towards ""good neighborliness"" and economic interests. It began talks with regional foes such as Iran, reconciled with Turkey, reached out to regional pariah Syria, and signed a peace agreement with Israel. The message was that the foreign policy would work to future-proof its economy as well as its security. But a shock came in January, when it became the target of fatal attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebel group two years after it began withdrawing its military forces from that country. The Iran-backed Houthis said the strikes were in response to continued Emirati interference in Yemen's affairs. The United States, which has been trying to reach a new nuclear agreement with the Houthis' patrons in Tehran, found itself thrust back into the region's spotlight. President Joe Biden, who had removed the Houthis from the US terror list less than a month into taking office in 2021, said he would reconsider the move. The UAE, one of America's closest allies in the region, pushed for more action, including military support. And the US has so far obliged. This month, it sent Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, head of the US Central Command, to the UAE to reinforce the country's defenses by helping it target drones before they are launched. It is also deploying a destroyer with guided missile defense capabilities to patrol the UAE's waters, and a squadron of F-22 fighter jets arrived in Abu Dhabi this week.  With its immediate focus on Russia's troop buildup on Ukrain's borders, , as well as its medium-to-long term eye on China's growing power, the United States' military interests are shifting away from the Middle East. A conclusion of the Iran deal is likely to dampen its threat perception and the very reason for its strong presence in the region, leading to a further disengagement. But, wary of leaving a security vacuum for its adversaries to fill, the message America appears to be sending Gulf states is that while it may be leaving, it will be back as the need arises. Other top Middle East news Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett meets with the King of Bahrain in Manama on Tuesday.Israeli prime minister offers 'goodwill and cooperation' on first Bahrain visit Naftali Bennett met Bahrain's king as well as Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, who said he is looking forward to ""a broader Middle East, free of conflicts, based on principles of mutual respect, understanding, and shared responsibility towards security."" Background: This is the first visit to Bahrain by an Israeli prime minister and comes a year and a half after the two countries agreed to normalize relations. Bennett's trip was his second to a Gulf state, after he visited the United Arab Emirates in December. Why it matters: This is the latest sign of the strengthening ties between some Gulf states and Israel. Shared regional security concerns, in particular fears over Iran, played a key part in underpinning normalization. Among Bennett's first appointments Tuesday was a meeting with US military officials at the Bahrain headquarters of the US Fifth Fleet.  Iranian president to travel to Qatar for gas forum  Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi will travel to Qatar on Thursday to attend the Gas Exporting Countries Forum in Doha, Iran state-run outlet IRNA said on Monday. This comes as the two gas-producing countries look to ""boost cooperation and convergence in energy policies.""  Background: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar in mid-2017 after accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Qatar has repeatedly denied. Tehran and Doha maintained close ties throughout the three-year boycott. Why it matters: Raisi's trip to Qatar is his first to a Gulf-Arab state since he took office and it comes amid the backdrop of multiple attacks by the Iranian-backed Yemen's Houthis on the United Arab Emirates over the last month.  Swedish multinational Ericsson admits it may have inadvertently funded ISIS Shares in Ericsson plummeted on Wednesday after the telecommunications company released the results of an internal investigation which found that the firm could have made payments to ISIS, Reuters reported.    Background: Ericsson started doing business in Iraq after the United Nations lifted an embargo on the country in 2010. The company discovered suspect payments made to circumvent Iraqi customs laws, which were paid in areas that were controlled by ISIS at the time.  Why it matters: Previous corruption allegations in countries such as China and Vietnam cost Ericsson more than $1 billion in 2019. Around the region A conference in Egypt on the African continent's shared heritage caused an outcry and a flurry of racist comments in the North African country last week. Titled 'One Africa: Returning to the Source,' the event was scheduled to take place in Aswan, Egypt on February 25 and 26, coinciding with US commemorations of Black History Month.  The event brochure said it aimed to show that ""all African cultures and peoples are linked together either through ethnicity, language, arts, or culture."" Among the hosts was Washington, DC-based IKG Cultural Resource Center, an organization that focuses on what they call the ""re-discovery of ancient African history and culture."" But in early February, English hashtags such as #StopAfrocentricConference and similar Arabic ones began trending on social media. Some called on Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism to shut down the seminar. The opposition was primarily to the perceived linking of ancient Egyptians to Black people. The debate even found its way to state-backed television, where prominent talk show host Nashaat Eldeehy said the organizers were ""racist"" and had a ""bias toward dark skin."" The backlash on social media turned ugly, with hundreds of commenters hurling racist insults at cultural historian Anthony T. Browder of IKG, one of the conference's main presenters. Soon after, the event was declared canceled on Browder's Facebook page and his page subsequently became unavailable. The cancellation was due to administrative reasons and its ""possible negative impact,"" he told CNN. As the debate raged, others on social media decried the harsh language used as ""racist"" and ""hateful."" New York-based Akhet Tours, one of the conference's organizers, didn't respond to requests for comment. One of the most intensely studied peoples of antiquity, ancient Egyptians have long been the subject of interest for researchers trying to identify their racial origin, culture and way of life.  DNA discovery reveals genetic history of ancient EgyptiansIn 2017, scientists in Germany were able to extract and decode mummies' genome data. In what was a wholly new frontier for Egyptologists, researchers found a strong connection with groups of ancient non-African populations based east of the Mediterranean. The study only sampled Middle Egypt, however, hypothesizing that race origins could differ in Northern and Southern Egypt. ""There is no relation between Blacks and the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization at all,"" said Zahi Hawass, a prominent Egyptologist and former Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, in a phone interview from Cairo. Bemoaning what he saw as ""a completely incorrect"" linking of Blacks to Egyptian civilization by the event organizers, he said the matter should nevertheless be debated by scientists, not lay people on social media. Given the size of the ancient Egyptian civilization, crossover between ethnicities must have taken place, said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo. ""Egypt, from quite early on, was a mixed culture because it is at the crossroads of two continents,"" she said. Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that the ministry was unaware of the conference and the events that followed.  Egypt has said of late that that it's taking steps to support and encourage cultural and economic cooperation across the African continent, emphasizing shared interest and calling for deeper regional integration. Black Arabs of sub-Saharan African origin in the Middle East and North Africa suffer social marginalization and unequal job prospects, and sometimes experience derogatory portrayals in the media, including in Egypt.

Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN)How to contain a runaway Covid outbreak, in a city committed to keeping cases at zero? That's the question now facing Hong Kong officials, as daily infections top 4,000, and previous fail-safe systems begin to buckle under the strain of their own uncompromising rules. For almost two years, Hong Kong had relied on a combination of stringent quarantines and sophisticated track-and-trace efforts to isolate positive cases, keeping the city comparatively virus-free -- even as the rest of the world began to loosen restrictions.  But those measures no longer appear sufficient in the face of the latest Omicron wave, which officials have described as a ""tsunami."" Hong Kong's insistence on sending all positive cases to hospital, irrespective of the severity, has led to at least one hospital being so overwhelmed it was forced to move patients on gurneys outside, lining them up in the parking lot.Read MoreMeanwhile, a raft of tightened restrictions and targeted lockdowns have led many experts and residents to question the sustainability of such an approach as the city enters the third year of the pandemic.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam at a news conference on February 15.On Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping took the unusual step of directly calling on Hong Kong officials to take ""all necessary measures,"" according to comments published on the front pages of two Chinese state-run newspapers. Xi's intervention has raised fears that further restrictions similar to those seen in mainland China, including a possible citywide lockdown, could soon follow. So far, the local government has firmly ruled out such a move, suggesting it would be impractical to confine more than 7 million people to their homes. But Xi's comments make clear that Hong Kong has little choice but to adhere to China's hard-line zero-Covid strategy -- whatever the cost.The biggest outbreak yetThe newest wave began in January, and quickly spun out of control despite authorities' increasingly desperate efforts.In mid-January, the government killed more than 2,500 hamsters and other small animals after a single Covid case was linked to a pet store, sparking widespread public outrage.Days later, a housing cluster prompted the government to lock down several buildings home to thousands of people. Soon, residents began complaining of trash piling up in the hallways, and of pay cuts for those who weren't able to work during the lockdown.In hindsight, it was an early sign of the chaos to come, and of a government unequipped for a wave of this magnitude despite having had more than two years to prepare.To date, less than 70% of the city's population has been fully vaccinated against Covid, according to government data, and vaccination rates among the elderly remain comparatively low despite vaccines being available since February 2021. Health officials push a trolley of supplies outside a locked-down residential building in Hong Kong on January 23. With numbers rising, authorities reimposed a series of familiar restrictions: closing all schools; shuttering bars, gyms, salons and numerous public spaces; suspending restaurant dine-in past 6 p.m., capping public gatherings; doubling down on a citywide mask mandate; and prohibiting more than two households to mix in private. But these measures -- part of the government's zero-Covid playbook each time a new outbreak arises -- failed to stop the surge. On Wednesday, the city reported a record 4,285 new cases. Before this wave, Hong Kong had never seen more than 200 new cases in a day.Many of the government's rules were formed with the zero-Covid goal in mind, such as hospitalization for all those who test positive for Covid -- regardless of their condition -- mandatory tests for anybody who may have been exposed, and quarantine of close contacts.Hong Kong's 'zero Covid' strategy frustrates travel-starved residentsThese rules and processes may have worked when Hong Kong was only dealing with a few dozen cases at a time -- but the scale of the latest outbreak has stretched the system to breaking point. As of Monday evening, seven of Hong Kong's 17 public hospitals had either reached or exceeded 100% inpatient bed occupancy -- leading to the makeshift outdoor wards, which could pose a problem this weekend with rain and cold temperatures expected. Long lines stretch across the city, with people waiting hours to get tested.But rather than consider different approaches, the government -- under pressure from Beijing -- has dug its heels in, more determined than ever to contain the outbreak.""At this moment, we still feel that (dynamic zero-Covid) is the best strategy for Hong Kong,"" the city's leader Carrie Lam said last week -- referring to a new label that aims to quickly suppress all outbreaks.Even before Xi's reported instructions, the Chinese central government stepped in earlier this week -- seemingly growing impatient with Hong Kong's inability to rein in the virus itself.  China will send health experts and medical supplies to Hong Kong, and help build new quarantine and isolation facilities, officials said -- bringing to mind the temporary hospitals that were constructed and operational within weeks in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic, at the start of it all.Lam has publicly welcomed the central government's support, admitting Tuesday that Hong Kong was struggling to cope with the exponential growth of cases. ""The problem we are facing is, given the magnitude, pace and severity of this fifth wave, it has outgrown our capacity,"" she said. A widening gapThough Hong Kong has been aligned with Beijing in pursuing zero-Covid, it could have taken a different route -- one now playing out in a very similar city, 1,600 miles (about 2,600 kilometers) away.Last August, Singapore -- which for years has competed with Hong Kong for the title of Asia's top international business hub -- was the first Asian country to declare it was moving away from a zero-Covid policy to living with the virus instead. It was soon followed by Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and others.People walk in the Kreta Ayer district of Singapore ahead of the Lunar New Year on January 29.The mood in Singapore is now drastically different than in Hong Kong. A high vaccination rate and reopened travel with two dozen countries mean daily life has more or less resumed. Though cases there are spiking as well, people are able to go to the movies, meet friends at the bar, even attend sports events and live concerts. The few restrictions left -- like caps on social gatherings -- may soon be lifted too when the Omicron wave subsides, the health minister said Monday. ""Like most Singaporeans, I am looking forward to it,"" he added.But there is little of that optimism in Hong Kong, with leaders defiant even as the city's tough travel restrictions render it increasingly isolated from the world. ""With the full support of the central (Chinese) government, the government's united effort, and citizens' full support, we have to fight against this wave of the virus,"" Lam said on Tuesday. ""Surrendering to the virus is not an option."""

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. (CNN)A new pair of X-ray eyes on the universe is allowing us to see extreme objects like never before. Just over two months after launching to space, NASA's newest explorer --- the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer, or IXPE -- shared its very first images. And they are stunning. The images offer a glimpse of Cassiopeia A, the famous remnant of a supernova, or exploding star.Glowing purple gas clouds can be seen around the remains of the star. These clouds were created when shock waves from the explosion heated surrounding gas to incredibly high temperatures, accelerating high energy particles called cosmic rays. ""The IXPE image of Cassiopeia A is bellissima, and we look forward to analyzing the polarimetry data to learn even more about this supernova remnant,"" said Paolo Soffitta, the Italian principal investigator for IXPE at the National Institute of Astrophysics in Rome, in a statement.Read MoreThe spacecraft, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Italian Space Agency, carries three telescopes. Although Cassiopeia A has been observed previously using other telescopes, IXPE is designed to reveal new insights about some of the most extreme objects in the universe, such as supernovae, black holes and neutron stars.This IXPE image maps the intensity of X-rays coming from Cassiopeia A. The colors, including cool purple, blue, red and white, correspond with the increasing brightness of the X-rays. The beautiful remnants of the Cassiopeia A supernova are located about 11,000 light-years away from Earth. It is now a giant bubble of hot, expanding gas, and it's the youngest known remnant from a supernova explosion, dating back 340 years ago, in our Milky Way galaxy. The light from this supernova first reached Earth in the 1670s. X-rays are highly energetic waves of light that are born from extremes. In space, these intense conditions include powerful magnetic fields, collisions between objects, explosions, scorching temperatures and rapid rotations. This light is practically encoded with the signature of what created it, but Earth's atmosphere prevents X-rays from reaching the ground. This is why scientists rely on X-ray telescopes in space.What new data on Cassiopeia A may revealNASA launches new x-ray telescope designed to unravel mysteries of black holesIn the new image, X-ray data previously captured by NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory can be seen in blue. Chandra launched in 1999 and set its sights on Cassiopeia A immediately, revealing the presence of either a black hole or neutron star at the center of the supernova remnant. Black holes and dense neutron stars are often created by the violent event of star death.""The IXPE image of Cassiopeia A is as historic as the Chandra image of the same supernova remnant,"" said Martin C. Weisskopf, IXPE principal investigator based at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, in a statement. ""It demonstrates IXPE's potential to gain new, never-before-seen information about Cassiopeia A, which is under analysis right now.""The new NASA mission orbits 370 miles (600 kilometers) above Earth's equator and just wrapped up a month-long phase of commissioning and testing out its instruments. While IXPE isn't as big as Chandra, it is the first space observatory of its kind. The satellite can see an often overlooked aspect of cosmic ray sources called polarization. Light becomes polarized when it passes through something that causes its particles to scatter.All polarized light bears the unique stamp of its source and what it passed through on the way. While waves of unpolarized light can vibrate in any direction, polarized light only vibrates in one direction. Titanium bubbles discovered in supernova could help solve mystery of exploding starsThe data IXPE has collected about Cassiopeia A can help scientists measure how polarization varies across the remnant, which is 10 light-years across. Using IXPE to study the polarization of cosmic X-rays could help scientists better understand the remnants of exploded stars, like black holes and neutron stars, their environments and how they produce X-rays. This perspective on extreme cosmic objects could also reveal the answers to larger fundamental questions about physics."
Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/david-perdue-georgia-governor-primary/index.html,Trump-backed Perdue struggles in Republican primary challenge in Georgia,"By Michael Warren and Gabby Orr, CNN"," (CNN)David Perdue kicked off his campaign for governor of Georgia with an emphatic endorsement from former President Donald Trump.But since then, his primary challenge to unseat Brian Kemp -- the Republican governor Trump loves to hate -- has been a big flop.Perdue, a former US senator, has so far raised a fraction of what Kemp has in his campaign war chest. Very few Republican elected officials, operatives, donors and activists in Georgia have abandoned Kemp in favor of Perdue. And limited public polling hasn't been promising, either.""I think Perdue is on life support and knows it,"" said one neutral GOP operative who requested anonymity to speak freely. ""The Kemp momentum is palpable."" The Perdue campaign is drawing attention from around the country, in part as a test case on the GOP's tolerance for Trump's vendettas. The former President remains exceedingly popular within the party, but his relentless focus on the 2020 election may have put him a beat behind Republicans who have moved on to other issues such as school mask mandates and the economy.Read MoreAt the same time, Georgia Republicans are eager to hold on to the governor's office in a general election race against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has only risen in national prominence since her loss to Kemp in 2018. Democrats recently won not only the presidential election but also both US Senate seats in the state, handing President Joe Biden a majority to advance his agenda while humiliating the GOP in a once reliably red state. State party leaders are keen on reasserting their dominance this fall.Since he launched his campaign in December, Perdue -- who lost a runoff last year to Democrat Jon Ossoff -- has struggled to bring aboard the network of political donors and operatives that have supported him and his cousin, former Gov. Sonny Perdue, in the past. One such figure is Alec Poitevint, a former Georgia Republican Party chairman during Sonny Perdue's governorship and a national party activist who chaired David Perdue's successful US Senate bid in 2014. Despite Poitevint's close ties to the Perdue family, he is supporting Kemp's reelection campaign.Trump's thirst for revenge is causing chaos in the Georgia governor's raceEven GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker, the Georgia football great whom Trump has also endorsed, has so far remained neutral in the gubernatorial primary.And although he raised more than $100 million in his Senate reelection campaign in 2020, this time, Perdue has not been able to translate Trump's endorsement into financial or political backing from Republican bigwigs in the state.In the first two months of his gubernatorial campaign through January 31, Perdue reported raising about $1.2 million, about half of the $2.5 million Kemp reported raising in the same two-month period. And Perdue reported far less cash on hand -- just under $900,000 -- than either Kemp ($12.7 million) or Abrams ($7.7 million.)""That's indicative of a lot of donors [who] have already committed to the governor,"" said Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime Republican operative in Atlanta who helped raise money for Perdue's Senate runoff race. ""I was in weekly contact with those donors. I have not found one that has said to me 'I've jumped ship.' They're saying 'What is David doing? I haven't heard from David.'""Perdue allies who have reached out to his campaign themselves to schedule fundraisers have found his team to be unresponsive and noncommittal, according to a person familiar with such complaints. Even Perdue and his team have sensed something is off. The former Dollar General CEO has expressed disappointment to people around him about the slow start to his political comeback, according to one person who has spoken to him and requested anonymity to speak freely. ""His team puts on the face when you talk to them about his performance, but I know people were very underwhelmed by his fundraising report and cash on hand, including in Trump's camp,"" said another person close to Perdue.When asked several questions about the state of the campaign, Jenni Sweat, a spokeswoman for Perdue, referred CNN to a recent interview between the candidate and Augusta television reporter Brad Means.""I'm going up against an incumbent governor. I'm a big boy, I knew that. This is no surprise. They're going to outspend us five or six or seven times,"" Perdue said. ""But we're not getting out of this race.""After this story first published, Sweat provided a follow-up statement to CNN.""While Brian Kemp collects checks from lobbyists and special interest groups, David Perdue is traveling around the state and connecting with thousands of everyday Georgians. Perdue won't outraise Kemp, but he will outwork him and become Georgia's next Governor,"" Sweat said.Sweat also disputed the claim that Perdue's team has been not been responsive to allies looking to schedule fundraisers.The power of incumbencyKemp's advantages as the incumbent are numerous. Eighty-eight Republican state House members and 31 Republican state senators already have endorsed Kemp, who, not unrelatedly, controls the fate of their legislation in the ongoing session of the General Assembly.Also in his corner is the Republican Governors Association, which has pledged to back incumbent governors like Kemp facing primary challenges. Last week, the RGA launched a $500,000 ad campaign in Georgia with a TV spot highlighting Kemp's accomplishments.And Kemp's vast list of executive appointments provides him with plenty of carrots and sticks. In 2021, he appointed Poitevint to the Georgia Ports Authority board, for instance. And through his appointments to the board of regents for the state's university system, Kemp has created a glide path for Sonny Perdue to be named the system's chancellor. The former two-term governor, who later served as Trump's agriculture secretary, notably has remained publicly neutral in the primary.Allies of David Perdue complain that Kemp is employing a scorched-earth approach in Atlanta that doesn't account for the broad appeal Perdue has with actual primary voters.""The people that are under the bubble of the state Capitol, they're all for Kemp,"" said one Georgia Republican operative. ""Everyone else is against him.""But others aren't convinced Georgia Republicans are itching to change horses midstream, particularly with Democrats looking to push their advantages in the state.""A lot of Republicans don't understand why you would challenge an incumbent Republican governor,"" said Tanenblatt. ""It's very obvious former President Trump has an issue with the governor, but that's not a really compelling reason.""Kemp, meanwhile, has done nothing to try to play nice with Trump to appeal to his die-hard supporters. In a recent interview with a local radio talk show host, Kemp dismissed a question that Trump's animus could be a factor in his reelection bid.""I can't worry about a bunch of noise from, you know, people in other states,"" Kemp said.Is the Trump factor waning?Perdue's lackluster start to his campaign illustrates the limits of Trump's ability to dictate the terms of intra-Republican fights. The fervor with which Trump and his allies have been looking to punish disloyalty -- such as Kemp's unwillingness to overturn Biden's narrow 2020 victory in Georgia -- is unmatched by those in the party looking toward future elections and fights.The negative reaction from donors and party elders to the Republican National Committee's recent censure of Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger reflects this shift in tolerance for Trump's obsession. And the explicit rejection of Trump's claims about the 2020 election by other leaders in the party, from moderates like Larry Hogan and Chris Christie to onetime allies like Mike Pence, are further evidence Republicans are not taking their marching orders from the former president.The Republican gubernatorial primary in Georgia will be a case study for the GOP's tolerance for Trump's vendettas, with the state's professional political class as the tip of the spear.Some Trump endorsements spark frustration and fractures in the GOP""I'm sure that President Trump still has the expectation that when he endorses someone, they are going to win by 30 points, but we might be moving into a time when that doesn't happen anymore,"" said the person close to Perdue. ""A Trump endorsement doesn't guarantee a runaway victory anymore.""The party's lukewarm reaction to a Trump-heavy primary fight illustrates how acutely the party has felt recent challenges to its dominance in Georgia -- and how the former president might be misreading the political environment in the current ground zero of American politics.Democratic gains in the suburbs of Atlanta in 2018 were a warning sign to the GOP. So was Biden's slim victory two years later, even as Trump falsely claimed that widespread voter fraud there and in other swing states had ""stolen"" the election from him.But it was their double loss in early January 2021 in a pair of runoff races for both US Senate seats that rocked Georgia Republicans. The victories by Ossoff over Perdue and Raphael Warnock over Sen. Kelly Loeffler flipped control of the Senate to the Democrats and seemed to finally force the GOP into a period of reflection.In the weeks and months following the runoffs, Republicans privately and publicly fumed that Trump's caterwauling about voter fraud had depressed GOP turnout.But the former President and his allies continued to focus their ire on Kemp, who had insisted publicly that he was constitutionally unable to intervene in the counting or certification of Georgia's results. Trump began the search for a primary challenger to Kemp and vowed to oust him from office.In March, Kemp blunted the criticism from Trump by signing into law a series of changes to the state's voting and elections process -- including shortening the early voting period, requiring photo ID for absentee ballots and outlawing elections officials from mailing out unsolicited absentee ballot applications. The reaction from the left was fierce. National Democrats and large corporations condemned the law as too restrictive. Most notably, Major League Baseball announced it would move the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver in response to the law. The backlash to the law worked in Kemp's favor, rallying Republicans to his defense against a corporate America deemed too ""woke"" by conservatives.Trump, however, saw the moment in Georgia differently. As Republicans around the country praised Kemp for standing up for the law, Trump released a statement blasting him for passing a law that was not restrictive enough and accusing Kemp of ""caving"" to corporate America.Meanwhile, Trump's efforts to find a primary challenger to Kemp faltered throughout much of 2021. One potential recruit, state Sen. Burt Jones, declined the former President's overture during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago. Jones decided to run for the open lieutenant governor's seat instead.Months later, during a rally in Georgia, Trump floated the idea that it ""might be better"" if Abrams, not Kemp, were governor. His suggestion that Georgia Republicans' enemy number-one should be given the top job was met with confusion and boos from the crowd.Even Trump's limited influence on the gubernatorial primary may be misguided. With Trump's backing, former state Rep. Vernon Jones, a Democrat-turned-pro-Trump-Republican who was also running for governor, dropped out of the race to instead run for a congressional seat. The push from the former President's team may have been designed to cull the field and set up Perdue as the only viable alternative to Kemp. But Jones' departure from the race increases the chances of Kemp winning an outright majority in the primary and avoiding a runoff against Perdue. Whether or not Trump perceives trouble in Perdue's campaign to rid him of Kemp is unclear.One top GOP operative noted that Perdue has not yet put his own money into the race, which has raised questions inside Trump's orbit about his level of commitment. A second person, who is close to Trump, said the former President has told people he is aware Perdue's effort has been underwhelming. Trump has also noted, according to this person, that he has yet to do a rally on Perdue's behalf.""David Perdue is running a strong campaign and is well positioned to become Georgia's next governor,"" said Taylor Budowich, a spokesman for Trump, when asked if the former President was concerned about Perdue's performance so far.But to many Georgia Republicans, the safe bet at the moment is on Kemp.""I'm a big David Perdue supporter,"" said Tanenblatt. ""I just don't understand it.""This story has been updated with a statement from David Perdue's campaign."

The information gathered is unclassified, but offers ""significant insight into US weapons platforms development and deployment timelines,"" and also covers export-controlled technology, according to the FBI, National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). It's one of the clearest public statements yet from the US government on how Kremlin-linked hackers have gathered intelligence on US defense contractors — a problem Washington has faced for years. The intrusions hit contractors supporting every US military branch, including the Air Force, Army, Navy and Space Force, as well as firms that work on defense and intelligence programs, US officials said. Blinken says US has seen 'no meaningful pullback' of Russian forces from the Ukraine borderThe advisory comes as US officials warn Russia against further invading Ukraine, along whose border Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops, according to US President Joe Biden. Read MoreUS government agencies have for years regularly released information on state-sponsored hacking threats, and US officials continue to say there is no credible, specific cyber threat to the US homeland tied to the Ukraine crisis.Contractors targeted by Russian hackers over the last two years have been involved in aircraft design and the development of combat and weapons systems, among other things, the US agencies said. ""By acquiring proprietary internal documents and email communications, adversaries may be able to adjust their own military plans and priorities, hasten technological development efforts, inform foreign policymakers of US intentions, and target potential sources for recruitment,"" the advisory says.

""Over the past several years, my family has been a source of tremendous encouragement, strength and support,"" Dickson said in a letter Wednesday to FAA employees shared with CNN. ""Nevertheless, after sometimes long and unavoidable periods of separation from my loved ones during the pandemic, it is time to devote my full time and attention to them. As I wrote in my letter to President Biden, it is time to go home.""In a statement, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he is grateful for Dickson's ""years of service to our country and his lifelong dedication to making sure our aviation system is the best and safest in the world.""""While all of us at USDOT will miss Steve as a leader and as a colleague, we are very happy for him and his wife, Janice, as they embark upon this next chapter together,"" Buttigieg said.Read MoreIt is not clear who will take the helm as FAA administrator.Dickson is about halfway through his term as the head of the agency, which has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including navigating the Covid-19 pandemic's sharp blow to air travel and soaring numbers of unruly commercial passengers.In 2021, the United States saw the worst year on record for unruly airplane passenger behavior, according to FAA data. The agency logged 5,981 reports of unruly passengers as of December 31, and of those, 4,290 -- nearly 72% -- were Covid-19 mask-related incidents.Dickson executed the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy for disruptive passengers, saying at the time of his order: ""Flying is the safest mode of transportation and I signed this order to keep it that way."" The policy, which took effect in January 2021, skips warnings or counseling and goes directly to legal penalties for unruly behavior. It was extended at least until the federal mask mandate is lifted.On Wednesday, the FAA announced that 43 more cases of unruly passengers had been referred to the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution. Recently, Dickson became the target of telecom companies for the FAA's handling of the rollout of new 5G cell service, which threatened possible interference with critical safety systems on commercial airliners.Dickson also oversaw the return of the Boeing 737 Max to service after two fatal crashes abroad grounded the plane worldwide. A former Delta Air Lines pilot, in 2020 Dickson flew the Max himself on test flights before it was returned to passenger service. Dickson began his career in the military and later flew commercial aircraft including the Boeing 727, 737, 757 and 767. In his post at Delta he was responsible for flight safety and pilot training.This story has been updated with additional details."

Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/house-democrats-retirements/index.html,Here's why Democrats' chances of winning in November are slipping,"Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large"," (CNN)House Democrats are retiring in numbers not seen in decades as a dire political outlook, new district lines and a negative environment at the US Capitol have combined into a toxic brew for lawmakers considering their political futures.On Tuesday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice became the 30th Democrat to announce plans to not seek re-election in 2022. By comparison, only 13 House Republicans are planning to call it quits or seek higher office.""I entered public service 30 years ago and never left,"" said Rice of her decision. ""I have always believed that holding political office is neither a destiny nor a right. As elected officials, we must give all we have and then know when it is time to allow others to serve.""The 30 House Democratic retirements are the most for the party since 1992, when a whopping 41(!) Democrats walked away from their seats. If one more House Democrat retires before the election, the 2022 cycle will tie the 1976 and 1978 election cycles as the second most retirements in modern history for the party, with 31. Democrats have already seen more retirements in this cycle than the last two elections combined. Amy Walter, the editor of the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan campaign tip sheet, cites three main reasons for the Democratic exodus. First, she told me the national environment; ""it's bad out there for Democrats,"" she said. Second, the weight of history; ""they all know that it's hard for party in White House to pick up seats. They can only afford to lose 5. They can do math."" And, finally the ""environment"" in the Capitol itself; ""Talk to any member or staffer and they'll tell you morale is low. It's a combination of January 6th, a lack of civility, plus a frustration with a fact that most legislation is leadership driven instead of member driven.""Read More

""I think it's a direct result of the malaise on Capitol Hill,"" said former New York Rep. Steve Israel, who previously ran the party's House campaign committee. ""Most Members decide to retire when they calculate that they might lose their next election. These days people are deciding to retire when they're confident they will win.""Regardless of the reasons, the reality is that this rate of Democratic retirements begins to feed on itself at some point. If you are a Democratic member on the fence about running again and see a number of your colleagues deciding to end their political careers, that has to impact your own thinking. The more retirements there are, the easier it is for any one member to walk away. And that sort of snowball effect is what we've seen in recent weeks, with Democratic retirements coming hot and heavy.The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022And we know from history that open seats -- those without an incumbent running -- are more likely to flip parties than seats where the incumbent is seeking re-election.There is a solid -- if not perfect -- correlation between high retirement levels and House seat losses. In 1992, for example, Republicans netted 10 House seats in the general election, according to Brookings' Vital Statistics on Congress. In 1978, the Republican gain was 15. In 1976, however, Democrats actually gained a seat despite the 31 retirements from within their ranks.Democrats' issues are compounded by the fact that Republicans have kept their own retirements very low. If no other House Republican walks away this year, the 13 calling it quits will be the party's lowest total since 1988. Add it up and you see LOTS of Democratic vulnerability and very little Republican danger.According to the Cook Political Report's rankings, there are 38 competitive Democratic-held seats compared to just 19 Republican-held seats. With the House Democratic majority so thin, that disparity in competitive seats is a very ominous omen for Democrats' chances this fall.The simple fact is this: Democrats see the writing on the wall. Many are opting to retire rather than either lose a reelection bid or become a member of the minority party in the House in January 2023. And that is causing a vicious cycle that further narrows Democrats' chances this November."

A study says it's not the case anymore,"By Jennifer Gray, CNN meteorologist"," (CNN)The West is burning out of control. Warmer temperatures and historically dry conditions are leading to longer and more devastating wildfire seasons than we have ever seen before. And now a new study suggests fires are becoming bigger and stronger at night, the time when firefighters used to be able to gain some ground. ""I personally saw extreme fire behavior at night on the Thomas Fire in Ventura and the Flash Fire near Saint Helena and Calistoga,"" said Chief Jesse Alexander with the Yuba City, California, fire department. He has fought some of the state's largest fires and has seen the intensity of the nighttime fires firsthand. ""Night changes everything,"" Alexander explained. ""Your senses are heightened due to lack of visibility, which makes it difficult to accurately determine fire size,"" adding, ""Fires always look bigger at night."" In reality, nighttime fires are indeed getting bigger and more intense, making them more difficult to fight.Read MoreNew study finds fires at night becoming more frequent""Nighttime fires have become more intense and more frequent in recent decades, as hot, dry nights are more commonplace,"" found the study led by the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences' (CIRES) Earth Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder,While the scientists found it to be true across the globe, the Western US seems to be off the charts.""There are certain places that are definitely seeing a much bigger increase than what the global picture is, and the Western US is one of them,"" Jennifer Balch, lead author on the study, told CNN.Scientists used satellite imagery from and hourly climate data from 81,000 fires around the world to measure the Vapor Pressure Deficit, or VPD. Weather satellites have the ability to sense different wavelengths, and one of those is fire temperature, as seen in a tweet from 2020.The evolution of the Oregon & N.

""This is a really important variable for fire science,"" said Balch. ""It's essentially the combination of temperature and humidity, and it indicates how fast the atmosphere is sucking moisture out of fuels.""""When VPD is relatively low, the air is cool and moist, and fires cannot thrive,"" the study outlined, which is when firefighters take advantage of better conditions to help contain the fire. However, when the VPD is high, ""the air is hot and dry, parched and primed for burning,"" according to the study. Scientists found nighttime conditions are becoming much more conducive for the spread of fires, stating ""one full week of additional flammable nights per year in burnable lands across the globe in the last 40 years.  And in the Western US, it increased by more: 11 nights, a 45% increase over the four decades (1979-2020).""  The study also used remote sensing and modeling techniques to track the progression of nighttime fires from tens of thousands of fires around the world. They determined ""globally, night fires have become 7.2% more intense from 2003-2020.""However, in the Western US, the number was four times greater at 28% more intense. Satellite image from NASA during the Camp Fire.""It is related to the combination of temperature increase in the West plus the drought conditions or how dry it is,"" Balch pointed out.""Those two factors are playing a significant role in how hot and dry our nights are across the Western US."" There was also a 36% increase of flammable nighttime hours between 1979 and 2020, while daytime flammable hours increased by 27%. ""The fact that fires are passing from day to night means that we're witnessing more extreme fires in terms of how fast they're moving, how long they're running, and how big they're getting,"" Balch added.Nighttime fires scorching the WestIn fact, we've seen several nighttime fires over recent years, raging out of control and destroying entire towns. The Dixie fire raged through the town of Greenville, California leveling the town in just two hours during the night in early August 2021.JUST WATCHEDVideo shows the town of Greenville, CA leveled by wildfire.ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVideo shows the town of Greenville, CA leveled by wildfire. 00:54In August 2021, the Caldor fire in California doubled in size, scorching roughly 25,000 acres in a single night.  The Marshall fire near Boulder which destroyed hundreds of homes on New Year's Eve, grew more than 6,000 acres overnight. And the Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise, California in 2018, at one point was burning an area the size of a football field every second through the overnight hours.""With climate change, we've seen a more than two degree Fahrenheit increase across the West,"" Balch confirmed. ""What that translates to is fire is very responsive, and it just takes a little bit of warming to get a lot more burning.""As fires at night become more intense, so does the job for firefighters on the front lines. What it's like fighting fires against the midnight sky ""Usually the night brings a little reprieve from the physical and emotional stress of the day, but when it stays dry, warm and windy overnight the stakes are high, and it's anything but relaxing,"" said Matthew Jeglum, incident meteorologist with NOAA's Western Region.He has seen nighttime fires from the front lines as a firefighter and a meteorologist. California firefighters battle wildfires day and night as homes are threatened nearby.""Warmer and drier nights can limit the time period when firefighters are able to do burnouts to help control the fire, which are a critical tool in the firefighter's toolbox,"" Jeglum noted. He explained when fire activity is elevated overnight due to dry conditions, it can also prevent firefighters from getting close enough to the fire to build a fire line right along the fire's edge. ""They instead build lines that leave unburned fuel between the line and the fire,"" says Jeglum. Fires active overnight also require more personnel to fight the fire, which requires more work in more exhausting conditions.""Injuries increase based on lack of visibility, harder to identify and isolate hazard trees (trees that fall on you) and fatigue may start to become a factor based upon your physical actions that were performed the previous 16-20 hours,"" Alexander outlined. Jeglum and Alexander both said firefighters many times have fewer resources available at night to help with the fire fight, especially aircraft.""You won't have aircraft backing you up because in almost all cases they can't fly,"" Jeglum explained. ""You can't see what the smoke column is doing. Situational awareness and communication can be harder. It's a unique experience.""It is a unique experience which may not seem unique at all in the years ahead.

Now, nights are warming faster than days are, amid our changing climate.  ""Traditionally, night was when we could make some progress with building containment lines and perform burning operations to get in front of the fire,"" Alexander recalled. ""On the Glass Fire (2021) we were just trying to catch it at night because it was going so fast.""Christmas lights adorn a house as fires rage in the background as the Marshall Fire didn't ease during the nighttime hours.2020 saw a record-breaking year in California for acres burned. Eight of the 10 largest fires in California history have occurred during the last five years. In Colorado, all the state's top 20 wildfires have occurred in the last 20 years (since 2001).Four of the top five largest wildfires have occurred in the last three years (2018-2020).""The fact that firefighters aren't getting a break at night, means that firefighters are fighting fires 24/7,"" said Balch.  It's a grim reality in a new environment of more intense, more frequent nighttime wildfires."

Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/investing/amc-popcorn/index.html,AMC may sell you popcorn outside of movie theaters,"By Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business)AMC Entertainment, the theater chain and darling of the meme stock crowd, is hoping to profit as more people stay home to watch movies on streaming networks like Netflix and Disney+. How? In the immortal words of NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens: Getcha popcorn ready. AMC (AMC) announced last week that it hired a veteran consumer products executive to try to ramp up its business of selling its popcorn at retail stores, not just in theaters. Ellen Copaken, previously an executive at Pepsi's (PEP) Frito-Lay snack unit and Twinkies owner Hostess Brands (TWNK), will start at AMC Friday as the company's vice president of growth strategy. It's a new position for AMC and Copaken will report to the chief strategy officer, Mark Pearson. AMC first said in November that it was planning to make a bigger bet on the popcorn business. CEO Adam Aron told investors on AMC's earnings conference call that month that the company planned to open up popcorn kiosks at retailers this year to take advantage of the fact that ""we have terrific long-standing business relationships with the biggest and best mall operators around."" Read MoreAMC CEO vows on Twitter to refinance movie theater chain's debt loadAron added that AMC was in discussions to start selling an AMC-branded line of microwave popcorn and also partner with food delivery services to make its popcorn a take-out option.AMC said in an email to CNN Business it had no further comment about the Copaken hiring or plans to expand its popcorn business.But AMC's decision to go all-in on popcorn outside the theater is a bold call. In some respects, it's an admission that the movie industry has fundamentally changed. Although viewers are still willing to go out to see big blockbusters like ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" in theaters, the combination of the pandemic and an abundance of streaming options have led to a change in consumer habits. More to AMC than big screens at the multiplexAMC, to its credit, is trying to adapt to this new reality. In addition to its popcorn plans, the company also announced in November that it hopes to profit from strong demand for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the digital assets which have taken the collectibles world by storm.""This is the 21st century after all, and it would seem that there may be a real opportunity for AMC in these areas,"" Aron said.Aron noted that the company is looking into partnerships that would let it accept cryptocurrencies as payment for movie tickets and concession stand items. AMC is even thinking about launching its own cryptocurrency. Short squeezes are pushing these stocks to the moonAron added that the theater chain is ""in conversation with multiple major Hollywood studios about the concept of joint venturing commemorative NFTs related to major film titles that show in our theaters.""These are some of the reasons why investors, particularly meme stock fans on Reddit, have fallen in love with AMC. They appreciate that Aron is thinking outside the (popcorn) box.Shares of AMC soared nearly 1,200% last year while the stocks of rivals Cinemark (CNK), IMAX (IMAX) and UK-based Regal and United Artists owner Cineworld all fell. But it's a different story this year. AMC, along with other meme stocks such as GameStop (GME), have fallen out of favor. AMC is down 25% so far in 2022 while the other three movie theater stocks have rallied.AMC still faces many challenges. Even though revenue is expected to nearly double in 2022, analysts are forecasting that the company will lose money again after racking up red ink in 2020 and 2021. (AMC reported a preliminary net loss for the fourth quarter of 2021 earlier this month.) It's also not certain that AMC will be able to make a huge dent in the retail popcorn market. The company faces formidable competition from consumer product giants who have established relationships with grocery stores. Campbell Soup (CPB) owns Pop Secret while ConAgra (CAG) is the parent company of Orville Redenbacher, stove top favorite Jiffy Pop and microwave brand Act II.Analysts aren't fans of the stock either. According to Refinitiv, three analysts have AMC rated a hold and six are recommending a sell. No analysts surveyed have a buy on the stock and the consensus price target is about $10.45 a share, nearly 50% below current levels. But it may be a mistake to count AMC out. An army of individual investors still love to rankle Wall Street pros and short sellers who bet against the stock."

Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/teen-brain-development-wellness/index.html,2 truths and a lie about why you are butting heads with your teen,"By Madeline Holcombe, CNN"," (CNN)The teenage brain undergoes a major renovation, and it can be a messy, stressful and uneven process. Although your teen's brain is working toward a better and more beautiful psychology, this perfectly natural process can often be difficult for families to manage, said Lisa Damour, an Ohio-based clinical psychologist specializing in the development of teenage girls.In those years between the cuddly attachment of childhood and the self-sufficiency of adulthood, teens can cause quite a headache for those who love them. They try their families' patience by arguing more, analyzing risk less and seeming to take on a more selfish attitude. That often leads their families to clamp down harder on restrictions and monitoring, said John Duffy, a clinical psychologist who practices in Chicago.But the stereotype that the teen years are the worst of them is unfair, and this period of trying new things, taking on new perspectives and striking out on their own, and faltering is key to adolescents successfully growing into adults, said Tina Bryson, a therapist in Pasadena, California.Rules and respect still matter, but if family members can understand more clearly what's going on in a teen's head, they can lean into those changes and help their children navigate their way more effectively into adulthood. Read More""If we set high standards for them or speak to them as the best versions of themselves, we tend to get that back from them,"" said Damour, who wrote ""Under Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls"" and ""Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions into Adulthood.""To learn a little more about teens, let's engage in a classic game of two truths and a lie.  True or false? Teens are more argumentativeTrue, and thank goodness they are, Duffy said. A hallmark of teen years is individuation, meaning they are growing out of being just a member of their family and learning who they are as an individual and member of the world. The process to do that often involves defining themselves first as not the same as those around them. That includes the adults in their lives.""Part of the reason you get adolescent pushback is largely not because they dislike their parents, even though they may say they do, but because they're trying to establish who they are, and they know that's got to be something different than Mom and Dad,"" Duffy said.'Kids very rarely do better than their parents are doing.' Here's what to doThis pushback is important for the individual and the community, as opposing the status quo can mean more innovation, said Bryson, author of ""The Power of Showing Up: How Parental Presence Shapes Who Our Kids Become and How Their Brains Get Wired.""Right, but that not fun for the adults in their lives. What can they do to get through it?As hard as it may be, don't take the pushback personally, and celebrate the time of exploration, Damour said.They still need your support and love. ""What we can do is always let them know that we as your family are on team you. You always fit with our family, no matter who you turn out to be,"" said Dr. Hina Talib, an adolescent medicine specialist and an associate professor of pediatrics at The Children's Hospital at Montefiore in Bronx, New York.The good news is that this is just one step in their identity formation, and the end result usually involves ""a beautiful blending together of who you are, where you end and where you started,"" Talib said.Leading your teen through adolescence with understanding will help them grow into competent adults, experts said.True or false? Teens take more risksTrue. They may make those who care for them sigh in frustration or bite their nails in fear, but teens need to take risks, Duffy said. It's not just human teens, either. Adults in one population of sea otters off the California coast know to stay far away from the shark-infested waters, and the young otters know to stay with their parents, Bryson said.But then there are the teen otters who often swim right into it. For teens who are glued to social media, this 4-step plan can help You might say, ""How foolish!"" but it's an important phase of adolescent otter development, where they learn to understand the risks of the predators around them as well as their own abilities and limitations, Bryson said.The thought of letting your own otter pup swim toward the sharks may seem unthinkable, but teens need room to take risks with your support and guidance backing them up.""They are testing their own levels of competence and resilience in the world,"" Duffy said. Letting your teens know you have got their back if they get in too deep and showing that you trust their decision-making are important ways to help prepare them to take on those risks.""Instead of immediately giving advice or jumping to whatever the answer is, I'm going to instead see this as a great opportunity to give my kids some reps, like when we lift weights,"" Bryson said. ""I'm going to give my kids reps where I can say ... 'What do you think would be a good idea?""Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. True or false? Teens are selfishHere is the lie -- for the most part. When your teen makes you late to work because they stayed in the bathroom for an extra 30 minutes or cried because you wouldn't buy them the trendiest shoes, try to think of them not as selfish, but self-searching, Talib said.The teen years are when we first start to have strong feelings of self-consciousness, noticing ourselves in comparison to those around us and worrying that we might not fit in, Duffy said. 20 board games and puzzles for the best family game night (Courtesy CNN Underscored)Your job as a loving adult is not to criticize or crush your teen's feelings that seem to put themselves at the center and the real problems of the world to the side. Instead, try to validate those feelings, Talib said.From there, you can remind your teen of their strengths and all they have going for them, while acknowledging this is a difficult time in their life, Damour said.Though it may be hard to grieve the loss of the child they once were and cope with the changes they are going through now, it's important to treat teens like the kind, capable humans that they can be, hold them to those standards, and be compassionate when they falter, Damour said."

(CNN)I deleted Instagram and TikTok. I logged out of Facebook and Twitter. I vaguely remembered I still had a Snapchat account and removed it from my app library before I put my phone down. Then I took a deep breath. It was January 1, 2022, and my New Year's ""micro-resolution"" was to give up social media for a month. I called it my ""dry"" January. (Let's be honest — with the Omicron variant raging last month, giving up alcohol was out of the question.) I knew I would still need to log into my social accounts to view videos for work. But I wanted — and maybe needed — the incessant, absent-minded scrolling on social media to stop. Thirty days later, here's what I learned.Read MoreScrolling is an addictionIt was compulsory. During the first week of January, I picked up my phone at least once an hour for no other reason than to scroll through my social media feeds. With the apps no longer available to open, I'd hesitate with my thumb hovering over the home screen, unsure of what to do next. 5 science-based strategies for nailing your New Year's resolutionsSimply putting down the phone seemed like admitting defeat. Surely there was something else I used this device for every three minutes. I could look through my camera roll to see what I'd been up to the last few days. Or peruse the CNN app. Usually I scrolled through already-read work emails to make sure I hadn't missed anything important. Does this sound sad? It felt sad to me. Scientists have told us for years that social media can provide your brain with a steady stream of dopamine, a brain chemical that influences your mood. Dopamine rewards us for pleasurable behavior and encourages us to do more of it. Not surprisingly, dopamine is also the main neurotransmitter involved in addiction. Phone addiction isn't yet a medical diagnosis. But I didn't like the feeling of not being able to control the impulse. And while after a few weeks I picked up my phone less, the phantom feeling of something I used to do all the time lingered.You can get a lot done in a few minutesI once read a book called ""168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think"" by Laura Vanderkam. Turns out, it's true — especially if you give up social media. 'Revenge bedtime procrastination' could be robbing you of precious sleepThroughout the month, I took advantage of pockets of time that I used to spend scrolling to check off my to-do list. Moments waiting for the train were spent finishing the last chapter of my book club book. If I had five minutes before I was going to meet some friends, I loaded the dishwasher. Standing in line at the grocery store, I scheduled a repair man to fix our condo lock. It was amazing what I could get done in short bouts of time when I had nothing else to distract me. Real friendships take time My husband was away on a monthslong work trip over the holidays, and when he came home, I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. Too bad those rooftops had been dismantled. One by one, I sent text messages to his mom and my mom and my coworkers and our mutual friends. Several cramped fingers later, I was done.  This is not me complaining. I'm incredibly grateful to have a supportive network of family and friends. But cultivating those relationships outside of the fake social media world takes time and energy. I called and asked how they were doing, instead of just swiping through their stories. I set up dinner dates instead of sitting on my couch looking at their dinner from afar.  Over time, I learned which friendships I would dedicate that energy to, who would give it back to me, and which friends were mostly online acquaintances.It's not just love that can break your heartTo be clear, I need both kinds of friends. I need the ones who send me memes at 1 a.m. (how I missed the memes!) and I need the ones I can call at 1 a.m. when missing my husband something fierce. A month without social media just reminded me how important it is to prioritize spending time with my favorite people in real life. Daydreaming is a decent pastime Social media isn't all bad. Yes, I follow people who do stupid stunts and strangers who rant about their political views.

""We had not a brilliant day, but a good enough day to be the deserved winner.""Mo Salah might be the best Premier League player ever but is the 'unprecedented' Liverpool forward still underrated?'We needed to be ready to suffer'A high-tempo opening to the game saw Liverpool start quickly, with Mane -- newly crowned Africa Cup of Nations hero with Senegal -- squandering two of the visitors' best early chances.Inter were inches away from taking the lead when Ivan Perisic's low cross found Hakan Çalhanoğlu, the Turkish midfielder crashing a thunderous strike off the underside of Alisson's crossbar.Mane went close with an audacious acrobatic effort in the first half.With Perisic spearheading a surging start to the second-half for Inter, Klopp rung the changes. A triple substitution just before the hour-mark saw Elliot, Fabinho and Mane depart with Naby Keita, Jordan Henderson and new-signing Diaz enter. But it was the half-time substitute, Firmino, who made the breakthrough, the Brazilian darting across Alessandro Bastoni to superbly head an Andy Robertson corner across goalkeeper Samir Handanovic and just inside the far post.The goal had come against the run of play, yet within 10 minutes Liverpool had doubled their lead. Salah reacted fastest to captain Virgil van Dijk's nod down to rattle -- via a deflection -- a shot past a helpless Handanovic.It was Salah's eighth goal in seven Champions League matches this season.Perisic (L) proved a constant threat down Inter's left side.Having seen out the closing stages, Van Dijk said that Inter's dominance during periods of the game hadn't come as a surprise to Liverpool""Everyone expected to be under pressure, because they are a very good team and it is the Champions League,"" Van Dijk told BT Sport.""We needed to be ready to suffer and do the hard work, and we definitely did. Happy days.""Bayern woes continueIn Wednesday's other Champions League fixture, Kingsley Coman spared Bayern Munich's blushes as a disappointing week for the German club continued with a 1-1 draw against Red Bull Salzburg in Austria. Chikwubuike Adamu celebrates scoring the opening goal.Still reeling from Saturday's stunning 4-2 defeat to Vfl Bochum in the Bundesliga -- wherein they are pursuing a tenth straight title -- Bayern fell behind to Chukwubuike Adamu's first-half strike. Salzburg's valiant defending looked to have secured a famous win before Coman tapped home a heartbreaking injury time equalizer."

""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war,"" the official said.The new estimates would place the number of Russian forces north of the 150,000 figure President Joe Biden cited in a televised address earlier this week. Western leaders had already greeted Russia's claims of withdrawal with skepticism. On Tuesday, Biden said during a speech in the East Room that a withdrawal of Russian troops would be ""good,"" but that he had yet to see any evidence that such a pullback was underway. ""Our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position,"" Biden said. ""And the fact remains right now Russia has more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine and Belarus and along Ukraine's border.""Read MoreIn this photo taken from video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday, Russian armored vehicles are loaded onto railway platforms after the end of military drills in South Russia. The senior official again warned Russia could use a false pretext for an attack, including making claims about NATO activity or an incursion into Russian territory, or alleging atrocities were occurring in the eastern Donbas region, which has been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014.""We should expect more false reports from Russian state media over the coming days,"" the official said. ""We don't know what form the false pretext will take. But we hope the world is ready.""The announcements, delivered on an early evening briefing call, painted a stark picture as the US and Europe wait on tenterhooks for Putin to signal his intentions. American officials have said the window is open for a potential invasion but that the enigmatic Russian leader will still need to make the final decision.A day earlier, Biden had seized on signals from Moscow that it is willing to resume negotiations, saying there was ""plenty of room for diplomacy."" But the official speaking a day later largely discounted those prospects while still saying talks would continue.""We will continue to pursue diplomacy over the coming days while being prepared to respond swiftly and decisively,"" the official said. ""Russia keeps saying it wants to pursue a diplomatic solution; their actions indicate otherwise. We hope they will change course before starting a war that will bring catastrophic death and destruction.""On Tuesday, Putin claimed Russia was sending some troops back to base after completing drills in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014.But US and European leaders uniformly cast doubt on the claim.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had not yet seen ""any sign of de-escalation on the ground,"" but added that ""signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue"" were grounds for cautious optimism.The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a news conference in Kyiv that he was abiding by a rule when it comes to Russian claims: ""Do not hear and then believe. But do see and then believe.""And US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a morning interview Wednesday there is ""a difference between what Russia says and what it does.""""What we're seeing is no meaningful pullback,"" Blinken told ABC News.This story has been updated with more reporting."
Top Stories,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/europe/putin-pretext-war-hodge-analysis-intl/index.html,Is Putin creating a pretext for war? ,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN ","Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin is a man who likes to keep his options open, and the Ukraine crisis is no exception: As the Kremlin leader signals his willingness to engage on the diplomatic front, he is also bolstering a case for war.    Take the situation in Donbas, the territories in eastern Ukraine partly controlled by Russian-backed separatists. In a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, Putin dropped the ""g"" word to describe the situation there.   ""According to our estimates, what is happening in the Donbas today is genocide,"" Putin said.  Scholz pushed back, later telling reporters that Putin was ""wrong"" to use the term. But those comments were already out in the public realm -- and Putin had stepped up the rhetoric.Putin's grievance in the Donbas isn't new. He has spoken repeatedly about what he describes as the violation of the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, and has stated that it is within Russia's rights to intervene militarily to protect them.   Read MoreBut Putin appears to be making a case for his own version of a ""responsibility to protect,"" however distant the situation in Donbas may be from a Rwanda -- where over 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were killed over the course of 100 days in 1994 -- or Srebrenica -- where more than 7,000 mostly Muslim men and boys were slaughtered in 1995. Russian buildup continues, but insufficient for full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence says Invoking genocide echoes Russia's false claim that its neighbor, Georgia, committed genocide against civilians in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia in August 2008. During that brief conflict, Russia launched a massive military incursion that pushed deep into Georgian territory, a scenario that worries Western policymakers today when it comes to Ukraine.  The Investigative Committee, Russia's top law enforcement body, took Putin's comments a step further on Wednesday when it announced it had opened a criminal investigation into alleged evidence of what it called ""indiscriminate shelling"" of civilians in the Donbas region by Ukrainian forces since 2014. In a press release laced with politically charged language, the Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal case under Part 1 of Article 356 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which covers mistreatment of the civilian population and the use of means and methods prohibited by an international treaty in an armed conflict.

It's clear why the Kremlin wants to change the subject: Back in 2015, for instance, shelling blamed on Russian-backed Donbas separatists claimed the lives of at least 30 people in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.Since conflict in the Donbas began in 2014, thousands of civilians have been killed and injured in the fighting, according to United Nations estimates. But announcing an investigation -- not by an independent body, and at the height of a confrontation with Ukraine -- appears to be a clearly political move, whatever the truth of the allegations.  And then there's also the nettlesome question of the legal status of the separatist regions of Donbas. Russia has never recognized the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), in the Donbas, as sovereign and independent states, even as it has handed out Russian passports to people living there. Russian lawmakers earlier this week appealed to the Russian President to recognize the breakaway republics in Donbas as independent. That, too, creates a potential situation where Russia might declare the need to respond to Ukrainian ""aggression"" against those statelets.  Would that happen? Recognition of the DNR and LNR would effectively scuttle the Minsk agreements, a package of measures that, for now, the Kremlin says is the only way to resolve the Ukraine crisis.  But manufacturing more problems can also benefit the Kremlin: It expands the menu of options at Putin's disposal.   "

europe,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/14/europe/europe-covid-vaccines-opposition-populism-intl/index.html,Why Europe's fight against the pandemic is about to get much more dangerous ,"By Melissa Bell, Dalal Mawad and Richard Allen Greene, CNN","Paris (CNN)""Despite months of persuasion, despite intensive media campaigns, despite discussions in various media we have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated."" Those were the words of former Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg last month as he announced the first nationwide vaccine mandate in Europe. Now, Germany looks set to follow where Austria has led. Others have made vaccines mandatory for parts of the population and imposed restrictions that increasingly explicitly target the unvaccinated, as Europe battles the twin challenges of sharply rising Covid figures and plateauing vaccination rates. Nearly one year into the EU's vaccination campaign, and with around one in three Europeans still unvaccinated, it is not so much hesitancy that European governments are now facing as outright opposition, with the danger that as governments get tougher so too will popular anger towards them. The crucial question of trustRead MoreOnly 19% of Europeans include their government among their most trusted sources of reliable information on Covid-19 vaccines, according to a survey conducted in May 2021 by the European Barometer, a collection of cross-country public opinion surveys conducted regularly on behalf of the EU's institutions.Even before the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy in Europe was strongly correlated to a populist distrust of mainstream parties and governments. One study published in the European Journal of Public Health in 2019 found ""a highly significant positive association between the percentage of people in a country who voted for populist parties and the percentage who believe that vaccines are not important and not effective."" What the pandemic has provided is a Europe-wide real-time test of that correlation. Nearly two years in and with most countries having exhausted what means they had of encouraging people to get vaccinated, the map of those who remain unvaccinated shows that where there is distrust in government and traditional political parties -- as measured by the strength of populist movements -- many people have yet to get vaccinated.Essentially, people who trust institutions need no convincing in the face of a pandemic; people who don't are unlikely to be influenced at all. Bodies pile up outside hospital morgue as Romania struggles with fourth wave of CovidEastern Europe is where vaccination rates are the lowest. Bulgaria has the lowest rate of all, with just 26.6% of the total population vaccinated, according to government data. The country has also been going through a major political crisis with three parliamentary elections held this year. Difficulties with vaccine rollouts and in reaching more remote and elderly rural populations are also to blame in Eastern Europe, but in some of the countries where vaccine take-up has been lowest, populist parties are either in power or strong electorally. Further west, lower vaccination rates are also to be found in countries and regions with either popular or voluble populist or extremist movements, as in Germany, Austria and Northern Italy.In a paper published by the journal Psychological Medicine in October, Michele Roccato and Silvia Russo from the University of Turin argue that their study shows ""people with a populist orientation tend to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine, in line with previous research showing that vaccine refusal is often politicized, but that its politicization is not limited to the traditional left-right cleavage."" A new common enemySophie Tissier, who organizes protests against Covid-19 restrictions and vaccines in France, says that these protests have created a new political force that is radical but goes beyond party political lines. She says her group seeks to ""create a citizens' opposition which is beyond electoral considerations and much more like a watchdog that sits outside the world of politics to be able to tell it: 'Look here, you are no longer protecting our rights, you are no longer protecting our rights under the law.'"" Demonstrators march during a protest against coronavirus measures in Brussels, Belgium, on December 5, 2021.In August, more than 230,000 people took to the streets across the country in one day after France became one of the first European countries to announce the use of relatively strict vaccine passes.""It really set things alight because people realized that life as it was, was coming to an end,"" she said. ""People would no longer be free, or able to go out as they did.""Since then, protests have tapered off in France, partly because no mainstream party has been openly encouraging its supporters to join them. France's vaccine rates are among the highest in Europe, suggesting that even in countries where there is strong vaccine hesitancy -- as there was in France even before the pandemic -- far-right or populist parties' stance on the vaccine can have an impact. Elsewhere in Europe, such groups are clearly fanning the anti-vaccination flames. In Austria, several protests planned since the government announced its nationwide vaccine mandate last month have been planned by the far-right Freedom Party.The mandate is due to come into force in February 2022.Even as he announced the move, Schallenberg accused the Freedom Party of being responsible for the country's low vaccination rates and of having stirred up vaccine hesitancy. ""We have too many political forces in this country that are fighting against [vaccination] vehemently, massively and publicly. That is irresponsible,"" Schallenberg said, adding: ""Incited by these radical opponents of vaccination, by specious fake news, unfortunately too many of us have not been vaccinated. The consequence is overcrowded intensive care units and enormous human suffering.""The world has the tools to end the coronavirus pandemic. They're not being used properlyIn other European countries, populist parties have also jumped on the bandwagon. And the divide in opinion over pandemic measures is no longer about extreme left and extreme right, said French political scientist Jean-Yves Camus, but ""between the mainstream and the periphery."" ""It's much more about the extreme,"" Camus said. ""The most extreme fringe groups taking advantage of the pandemic to say: 'This virus is fake, there is no pandemic and you are being tricked by your governments. It's a worldwide conspiracy of your national governments. They are using the pandemic to infringe on your individual rights and using vaccination passes to have your personal data,' and so on."" In parts of Eastern Europe, but also in and around Germany -- from Northern Italy to the Netherlands and Austria -- parties which once focused on immigration or Europe have been tapping into the widespread anger of those opposed to vaccines and Covid-19 restrictions, shifting their attention to an issue far more likely to appeal to the apolitical and to cut across traditional party political lines. Their new enemy is far more federating: The Covid-19 measures and vaccination campaigns that they say threaten their freedom. A protester wearing a mask depicting syringes applauds in Geneva, Switzerland, on October 9, 2021, during a rally against coronavirus measures.Vaccine mandatesThe World Health Organization has cautioned against vaccine mandates, because of their potential impact on public confidence and public trust. Dr Hans Kluge, WHO's Europe Director, said they should be used as ""an absolute last resort, and only applicable when all other feasible options to improve vaccine uptake have been exhausted.""In a part of the world where the fight against the pandemic has already been hampered by vaccine hesitancy, such mandates could fuel more resistance. ""The worry is that anti-vaxxers could come to hold even more extreme positions,"" said Russo, of the University of Turin. ""That's one risk. But we should also consider that where vaccines become mandatory, there will need to be controls and that could further undermine institutional trust. ""In other words, forced vaccination might push people into vaccination centers but it will also drive some of them to the streets, confirming and further fueling their deeply held suspicion of ""the system."" The fight against the pandemic may one day come to an end, but the fight against populism in Europe could be just beginning."

It's clear why the Kremlin wants to change the subject: Back in 2015, for instance, shelling blamed on Russian-backed Donbas separatists claimed the lives of at least 30 people in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.Since conflict in the Donbas began in 2014, thousands of civilians have been killed and injured in the fighting, according to United Nations estimates. But announcing an investigation -- not by an independent body, and at the height of a confrontation with Ukraine -- appears to be a clearly political move, whatever the truth of the allegations.  And then there's also the nettlesome question of the legal status of the separatist regions of Donbas. Russia has never recognized the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), in the Donbas, as sovereign and independent states, even as it has handed out Russian passports to people living there. Russian lawmakers earlier this week appealed to the Russian President to recognize the breakaway republics in Donbas as independent. That, too, creates a potential situation where Russia might declare the need to respond to Ukrainian ""aggression"" against those statelets.  Would that happen? Recognition of the DNR and LNR would effectively scuttle the Minsk agreements, a package of measures that, for now, the Kremlin says is the only way to resolve the Ukraine crisis.  But manufacturing more problems can also benefit the Kremlin: It expands the menu of options at Putin's disposal.   "
europe,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/europe/ukraine-russia-news-wednesday/index.html,"Russian buildup continues, but insufficient for full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence says ","Exclusive by Matthew Chance, CNN ","Kyiv, Ukraine  (CNN)Russia's buildup of troops at Ukraine's borders has persisted, despite Moscow's claims of a drawdown, but the number of Russian forces remains insufficient for an invasion, according to a Ukrainian intelligence report shared exclusively with CNN. The total number of Russian troops at the border has increased in recent days to more than 148,000, including more than 126,000 ground troops, the report says, echoing US intelligence about the build-up. A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson affirmed the reporting in comments to CNN ahead of an address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was sending some of its troops at the border back to base after completing exercises. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg rejected Putin's claim and said the military buildup was continuing, describing it as ""the most serious crisis in decades."" A Ukrainian serviceman runs during an exercise in the Joint Forces Operation, in the Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2022. A statement by NATO later on Wednesday said the buildup was ""very large scale, unprovoked and unjustified."" NATO also said it was deploying additional land forces in the eastern part of the alliance, in addition to maritime and air assets. The measures, the statement said, remained ""proportionate"" and ""non-escalatory,"" in response to the ""serious threat"" of the Russian troop buildup. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said that there was ""no meaningful pullback.""Read More""Unfortunately there's a difference between what Russia says and what it does. And what we're seeing is no meaningful pullback,"" Blinken said on ABC's Good Morning America.""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border,"" he said.The US alleged on Wednesday evening that Russian forces massed along Ukraine's borders have increased by approximately 7,000 troops in recent days, with a senior US administration official saying the increase renders Russia's assertion of withdrawal ""false."" The official said that Putin's public openness to diplomacy was a guise, saying, ""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war.""

The numbers are consistent with the latest US assessment of the Russian troop buildup, but deviates from Western statements by playing down the threat of a full-scale invasion. Biden seeks to shore up his domestic flank in his showdown with Putin""The Russian military contingent near the Ukrainian border is insufficient to carry out a successful large-scale armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the report said. Instead, Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia has focused its efforts on ""destabilizing Ukraine's internal situation"" using punitive economic and energy-related tactics, as well as cyberattacks. Largest cyberattack of its kindA high-volume cyberattack that temporarily blocked access to the websites of Ukrainian defense agencies and banks on Tuesday was ""the largest (such attack) in the history of Ukraine,"" according to a government minister.Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who is also the minister of digital transformation, added that it is too early to tell who was responsible for the attack.The so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack -- which bombarded Ukrainian websites with phony traffic -- was coordinated and well planned, officials said.DDoS attacks often disrupt access to IT systems, but their impact can be more psychological rather than having any direct effect on a country's critical infrastructure.'Day of Unity'Meanwhile on Wednesday, Ukraine marked a so-called ""Day of Unity"" -- called for by Zelensky -- as a show of defiance against Russia. Hundreds of people observed flag-raising ceremonies in some of Ukraine's city centers. ""This gathering is how we show our power to Putin,"" Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy told CNN. Speaking from the port city of Mariupol, which is believed to be vulnerable to attack in the case of an invasion, Zelensky vowed to ""not succumb"" to Russian provocations. ""We are not intimidated by any predictions (of war), any people, enemies, or any dates, because we will defend ourselves, whether it's February 16th, 17th, or 18th -- in March or April or September or December,"" he said. ""What's important is this is the year 2022, not 2014. We've become much stronger,"" Zelensky added, referring to Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Ukraine blamed Russia for Tuesday's cyberattack. Authorities have only raised the possibility that Moscow could have been behind the incident."

Justice Minister Judit Varga said Brussels was abusing its powers against national member states.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference: ""Poland believes that centralization, bureaucratic centralization, federalization... is a dangerous process.""The EU has already frozen pandemic recovery funds worth 36 billion euros ($41 billion) for Poland and 7 billion euros for Hungary. The so-called ""conditionality mechanism"" could now affect any part of the EU budget, worth 1.8 trillion euros ($2 trillion) for 2021-27.Poland, the biggest formerly communist EU member with 38 million people, is eligible for more than 75 billion euros through 2027, including for climate, digitalization and public health. Hungary has a population around a quarter the size but has received an even greater share of EU spending per capita.Poland ignites EU anger with ruling that its laws supersede bloc's treaties""Hungary and Poland have been rapidly backsliding on media freedom, independence of judges, the right to protest,"" said Amnesty International. ""Instead of trying to oppose EU funds being conditional on respect for the rule of law, they should respect people's rights and clean up their act.""EU officials said the bloc might move on Hungary first, while political horse-trading would probably delay a decision to withhold funds at least until late this year.Poland and Hungary have threatened to retaliate by stalling other EU decisions that require unanimity, including on climate and energy, as well as foreign policy.Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told Reuters that the dispute would not lead Hungary to block an EU-Africa summit later this week or interfere with any potential sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.Katalin Cseh, a liberal Hungarian EU lawmaker, said ignoring the erosion of the rule of law in Poland and Hungary would be comparable to the dark comedy film ""Don't Look Up"", in which politicians fail to stop an asteroid from destroying the Earth.""If we are sitting tight and assessing, then Mr Orban and Mr Morawiecki would achieve their goal of destroying the Union from within,"" she said.

europe,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/europe/russia-troops-bases-analysis-intl/index.html,Russia says it's moving some troops to their bases. What does this mean?,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN","Moscow (CNN)On Wednesday, Belarus' foreign minister said ""not a single"" Russian soldier or piece of military equipment would remain in its territory after joint military drills conclude, while the Russian Ministry of Defense released video showing military equipment crossing the bridge from Crimea into Russia. This all comes a day after Russia announced that some troops would be returning to their home bases after completing exercises -- but President Joe Biden said the US had not yet verified any drawdown of the 150,000 Russian troops amassed near Ukraine's borders.How significant are the latest developments?Let's start with what we know. The statement given on Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, was very short on specifics. Troops of Russia's Southern and Western Military Districts, he said, had begun loading up their gear to return to their bases, but gave few specifics about where those units had been exercising, what their home stations are, or how many troops in total were heading home.  What's more, we know from Ministry of Defense news releases that exercises in Belarus involve a significant number of troops from around the Russian Federation, including units based in Russia's Eastern Military District -- several time zones east of European Russia, a massive region bounded at its eastern edge by the Pacific Ocean.  Read MoreRussia says it's withdrawing some troops following exercises around Ukraine, but major drills continueRussia is a massive country spanning 11 time zones; its military divides the country into five administrative territories: the Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Districts and the Northern Fleet.Troops leaving exercises in Crimea -- annexed by Russia in 2014 -- were technically exercising inside Russia's Southern Military District. Troops of the Southern Military District could potentially be returning to bases in the north Caucasus or Rostov oblast.  Tuesday's statements, then, gives us very little official clue about how significant this move is: It could easily be a rotation -- with fresh troops falling in -- or a gradual drawdown after exercises. And Konashenkov made it clear that Russia's current exercises at sea have a fairly global sweep, taking place in ""operationally important areas of the world's oceans"" and in the waters adjacent to the territory of Russia. There are things to watch out for in the coming days. Putin and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko are set to meet this week, and we may get some hint on when the exercises in Belarus will conclude -- and when Russian soldiers there will go home.  Asked about whether a decision on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus would be made during that meeting, Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said: ""Let's not jump ahead. Let's wait for the meeting."" What the US is watching that could signal Russia is launching an invasion of UkraineIn the meantime, some Western officials were skeptical of the Russian troop announcement and said there had been no proof that a de-escalation of the crisis is on the cards.   ""The signs coming from Moscow about willingness to continue to engage in diplomatic efforts ... gives some reason for cautious optimism. But we will, of course, follow very closely what's happening on the ground and whether this is reflected in some real de-escalation of the Russian military build-up in around Ukraine,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Tuesday."

United States President Joe Biden told reporters Tuesday that the US has ""not yet verified the Russian military units are returning to their home bases,"" saying that they ""remain very much in a threatening position.""Speaking earlier at a news conference in Moscow alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin said he continued to view Western deterrence measures as a ""direct and immediate threat to national security.""""The responses we received from the United States and NATO members to security guarantees proposals, in our opinion, do not meet the three basic Russian requirements,"" Putin said. Read More""We are ready to continue this joint work further. We are also ready to follow the negotiation track but all issues must be considered as a whole, without being separated from the main Russian proposals, the implementation of which is an unconditional priority for us.""Russia says it's moving some troops to their bases. What does this mean?Biden said Tuesday that Russia has amassed ""more than 150,000 troops circling Ukraine and Belarus, and along Ukraine's border,"" underscoring fears from Western and Ukrainian intelligence officials that an invasion could be imminent. Among the Kremlin's demands are a guarantee that Ukraine will never be permitted to join NATO and that the alliance roll back its expansion in Eastern Europe. The US and its NATO allies have repeatedly said such proposals are non-starters.Putin also invoked the word ""genocide"" Tuesday to describe the situation in territories in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatist militants, calling out the West for what he insinuated was a double standard for justifying military intervention. Claims of discrimination against Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine were one of the justifications Russia used when it annexed Crimea in 2014.Putin's comments came hours after the Russian defense ministry said some troops from its Southern and Western military districts had begun to return to their home stations. The announcement did not specify where those troops were permanently based, where they had been exercising, or how many of them were withdrawing, and it was viewed with skepticism by officials from Ukraine, the US and NATO, who called on Russia to provide proof it was willing to deescalate the crisis on the border. ""Various statements are constantly being made from the Russian Federation, so we already have a rule: 'Do not hear and then believe. But do see and then believe,'"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a news conference in Kyiv. ""When we see the withdrawal, then we will believe in de-escalation.""NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had not yet seen ""any sign of deescalation on the ground,"" but added that ""signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue"" were grounds for cautious optimism. Videos show Russian units and missiles advancing toward Ukraine borderPersonnel from Russia's Southern military district began returning to base from Crimea -- the territory annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 -- following the conclusion of exercises,  state news agency RIA-Novosti reported Tuesday, citing Southern military district spokesperson Col. Vadim Astafyev.""The personnel of the battalion tactical groups made marches to the areas of railway stations, where the loading of military equipment on the echelons is organized. Heavy tracked armored vehicles -- tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery -- are fixed on the platforms of the wagons, Astafyev said. Earlier Tuesday, Major General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian defense ministry, announced the troop movements but also added that large-scale drills would continue.   ""In the armed forces of the Russian Federation, a complex of large-scale operational training measures by the forces continues, with almost all military districts, fleets and airborne troops taking part in them,"" he said. ""As part of the test of the reaction forces of the Union State, a joint Russian-Belarusian exercise 'Allied Resolve-2022' is being held on the territory of the Republic of Belarus.""Konashenkov also said a series of naval drills -- involving surface ships, submarines and naval aviation -- was underway both in ""operationally important areas of the world's oceans"" and in the waters adjacent to the territory of Russia. ""Exercises are continuing with formations and military units at other training grounds on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" he added. Meanwhile on Tuesday, a cyberattack hit the websites of Ukraine's defense ministry and armed forces, and the websites of two Ukrainian banks.It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the hacking incident.'Still time to step back from the brink'The Kremlin's troop announcement came a day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there was still room for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. In a carefully choreographed meeting that was shown on Russian television on Monday, Putin asked Lavrov: is there a ""chance to reach an agreement with our partners on key issues that are of concern to us, or is it just an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiation process that has no logical resolution?""Seated at the opposite end of a very long table, Lavrov responded: ""If we are ready to listen to some counter-proposals, it seems to me that our possibilities are far from being exhausted.""NATO's Stoltenberg on Tuesday expressed hope that a war could be avoided, but said the alliance would not compromise on its core principles. ""Everything is now in place for a new attack, but Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday.In this photo taken from video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry on Tuesday, Russian armored vehicles are loaded onto railway platforms after the end of military drills. The flurry of high-profile diplomacy continued Tuesday with Scholz becoming the latest leader to travel to Moscow for talks. Scholz, who was meeting Putin for the first time as the German Chancellor, said it was the leaders' ""damned duty to prevent a war in Europe.""""For us Germans, but also for all Europeans, it is important that sustainable security cannot be achieved against Russia, but only with Russia,"" Scholz said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   However, while Scholz was urging de-escalation, he didn't shy away from criticizing Russia, specifically mentioning the jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who is currently facing another trial. ""As far as Mr. Navalny is concerned, my position is very clear, this is not compatible with the principles of the rule of law.""Meanwhile, US ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said Tuesday the US was ""monitoring the situation"" after the Kremlin's troop announcement, but added that the US ""will have to verify"" any claims of a potential move towards deescalation by Russia. ""We have noticed today that Russia is claiming that they are moving towards some sort of de-escalation. We are monitoring the situation,"" Smith said. ""We will have to verify whether or not that is in fact the case.Speaking during a press briefing in Brussels, the US ambassador further noted that Russia ""made a similar claim"" regarding a potential de-escalation of tensions in December, but this later proved false. But while the Kremlin was talking about troops returning home, satellite images released by Maxar Technologies revealed fresh signs of a Russian buildup. Satellite images taken on February 13 show at least 60 helicopters on the northern portion of the previously unused military base in Crimea.An analysis of the images showed that at least 60 helicopters had landed within the past few days at a previously vacant airbase in Russian-occupied Crimea. The helicopters are a mixture of transport and attack aircraft. Archival satellite imagery reviewed by CNN indicates the base at Donuzlav Lake on the northwest coast of Crimea has been vacant since at least 2003.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he was not encouraged by the latest intelligence on Russia's buildup around Ukraine and said western leaders were receiving ""mixed signals"" from Moscow.  ""We've got Russian field hospitals being constructed near the border with Ukraine, in Belarus for [what] only can be construed as a preparation for an invasion,"" Johnson said. ""You've got more battalion tactical groups actually being brought closer to the border with Ukraine, according to the intelligence that we're seeing.""Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave a noncommittal response Tuesday when asked about a move by Russian lawmakers to appeal to President Putin to recognize two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent. Donetsk and Luhank have been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014.Asked in a conference call with reporters about the legislative action, Peskov said: ""No one remains indifferent to the fate of Donbas. But still, Russia has repeatedly declared that it remains committed to the Minsk package of measures, and that Russia is in favor of the implementation of the entire Minsk plan as soon as possible, in the sequence that exists.""Donbas refers to the territories in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia-backed separatist militants.Asked about the issue during the news conference with Scholz, Putin said there were ""mass and systematic violations of human rights in Ukraine and outright discrimination of Russian speaking citizens on legislative level.""Putin responded abruptly when Scholz expressed hope for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine, after recalling NATO's military intervention in response to the danger of genocide in the former Yugoslavia. ""According to our estimates, what is happening in the Donbas today is genocide,"" Putin responded.Putin has spoken repeatedly about what he describes as the violation of the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine and elsewhere, and has stated that it is within Russia's rights to intervene militarily to protect them. It was not the first time he's used the word ""genocide"" to describe what he calls Russophobia or discrimination against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. It's a term -- much like the word ""fascist"" -- that can be thrown around loosely in Russian political speech and does not necessarily imply direct comparison to internationally defined and recognized cases of genocide.CNN's Uliana Pavlova, Darya Tarasova and Nathan Hodge reported from Moscow, while CNN's Ivana Kottasová, Tim Lister, Jim Sciutto and Olga Voytovich reported from Kyiv."

europe,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/europe/ukraine-russia-disinformation-us-uk-intelligence-cmd-gbr-intl/index.html,"The West is a player in the Ukraine information war. Unlike Russia, it has to convince the public","By Tara John, CNN"," (CNN)Corpses strewn through wrecked buildings in the aftermath of an apparently deadly explosion. Distraught mourners, grieving for lost loved ones. And amid the smoldering ruins, evidence of Western military equipment.  In a world all too familiar with graphic images of one disaster after another, it's easy to imagine the grim footage. And the United States says that's exactly what this is: make-believe violence. It says Russia is plotting to stage a fake attack, and shoot a gory propaganda video of it, as a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. The clip would frame the Ukrainian military -- and by extension, their NATO allies -- for an attack on Russian-speaking people. But while the US government declassified the information about the alleged plot last week, it didn't share any of its underlying evidence with the public. In a heated briefing room exchange last week, journalists demanded proof to support the claim, with one reporter accusing the State Department of veering into ""Alex Jones territory.""State Department spokesperson Ned Price responded that the government was confident in the information but would not say if the US had seen any such video. Read More""We are trying to deter the Russians from moving forward with this type of activity. That is why we are making it public,"" Price said, before adding: ""If you doubt the credibility of the US government, of the British government, of other governments, and want to find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do. ""The US claim came days after the British government warned of a Russian plot to install a pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine, citing intelligence that it also declined to release publicly. Analysts said the developments showed the West was becoming more determined to take on Russia in the information war, a sphere in which the Kremlin has often had the upper hand in recent years.But that is not without its risks.How the Biden administration is aggressively releasing intelligence in an attempt to deter Russia It is one thing to try to deter potential disinformation campaigns, which are designed to give plausible deniability to leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin. But it becomes another when a liberal democracy relies on unpublished intelligence to convince an already skeptical public of a looming threat.News of the alleged false flag attack comes at a time of historically low levels of public trust in the US and British governments. As a result, there is more pressure for officials to lift the veil on their intelligence. ""During the Cold War, most people knew about the Soviet threat, and we did not need to provide evidence to show that was an issue,"" said Dan Lomas, an intelligence and security studies lecturer at London's Brunel University, explaining that in a ""bipolar world the threat was pretty real to more people.""Western intelligence agencies during the Cold War would ""collect, analyze information, and then provide that to governments who will then use that to shape policy responses,"" he said. That process is less straightforward in our current multipolar world. ""Now we are getting into a world of multiple threats, the water has been muddied, and often evidence needs to be cited to justify policy actions taken"" by liberal democracies, Lomas said.State Department spokesman Ned Price speaks during a briefing in Washington, DC, on February 1, 2022.Despite last Thursday's heated briefing room exchange, four disinformation analysts CNN spoke to were adamant that declassifying intelligence of this sort was unprecedented for the US. They said it also showed that democracies were finally taking pre-emptive action against the Kremlin's disinformation playbook -- which primed Russians for the 2014 invasion of Crimea and caught out NATO and its allies. Russian Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told CNN last week that Moscow was not planning any false flag operations as a pretext to invade Ukraine. But Russia is no stranger to such tactics. ""In 2014, an actress claimed that a little boy had been crucified in the Donbas, and that was completely false,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert and fellow at the Wilson Center, a non-partisan think tank. ""It was debunked, but this story ran on Russian media and, to my knowledge, they still run with that story.""  Jankowicz told CNN that Russia had ""handily misattributed footage from the Balkan wars that they claimed to be from South Ossetia and Abkhazia"" during its five-day war with Georgia in 2008. She said ""prebuttals"" to Russian disinformation were a vital deterrent in an information war in which the West has largely been on the back foot.Patchy record A satellite image shows deployment of troop housing area and military vehicles in Rechitsa, Belarus on February 9. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite its massive troop buildup in the region. But there are credible reasons for not revealing intelligence: doing so risks unmasking sources and divulging the methodologies employed to gather it. Lomas said that in 1927 the British government read out diplomatic signals intelligence in Parliament to justify a raid on a Soviet trade delegation in London. ""The Russians then knew that their communications were being read by the British government,"" he explained.  As a result, Russia changed its messaging system, impacting Britain's ability to intercept Russian communications for years. Yet journalists are understandably wary of reporting messages they are unable to verify independently -- especially when the official narrative hasn't always proved accurate.Last August, when a Hellfire missile fired by a US drone struck a car in a Kabul compound, the Pentagon insisted that the dead were terrorists. An investigation later revealed that all those killed were civilians, among them seven children. Past intelligence failures, like the ""weapons of mass destruction"" given as the rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, continue to haunt public opinion of American and British interventions. Why Russia loves banging on the 'fake news' drumIn 2013, the British government lost a parliamentary vote on joining US-led airstrikes in Syria despite intelligence linking Syrian government forces to a chemical weapons attack in Damascus. Polling at the time showed the majority of the British public opposed airstrikes. Ahead of the vote, then-Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""One thing is indisputable: The well of public opinion was well and truly poisoned by the Iraq episode, and we need to understand the public skepticism.""Nevertheless, there are ways to fix the credibility problem. Lomas suggests finding a better messenger. When the British government alleged in January that Russia was looking to install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv, the revelation came just as Prime Minister Boris Johnson was embroiled in a political crisis over alleged parties in Downing Street while the UK was under Covid-19 restrictions. This meant that Britain's release of sensitive intelligence was greeted with skepticism by some commentators, who wondered whether the hawkish tone was part of a strategy designed to help keep Johnson in power.Lomas said the news might have landed better if it had been announced by Britain's intelligence agencies, since ""polling consistently tells us that intelligence agencies and ... civil servants are trusted far more than politicians in delivering key messages.""Information warsThe debate over how to handle intelligence-based claims presented without evidence shows just how uneven the playing field is when dealing with autocracies such as Russia -- which has long used the information space as an active front in its conflicts. Most recently, Russia accused the search and rescue volunteer organization, the ""White Helmets"" group, in 2018 of chemical attacks linked to the Syrian regime -- a Moscow ally. The group, celebrated internationally for their live-saving work in Syria, was a frequent target of pro-Kremlin disinformation sites, which sought to delegitimize their work by claiming they were terrorists or stooges of Western intelligence. ""All we have on our side is the truth,"" said Jankowicz. ""Russia is willing to create troll accounts and other false amplifiers, and play with the facts, and manipulate images."" ""It is not fighting fire with fire in that regard,"" she explained. ""We're always going to be a little bit less equipped to deal with this stuff.""Members of the Syrian civil defence, known as the White Helmets, pull out a child from under the rubble following a reported Russian air strike on Maaret al-Numan in Syria's Idlib province in 2019. Since 2014, when pro-Russian rebels began seizing territory in eastern Ukraine, there has been a constant stream of disinformation about Ukraine. None of the analysts CNN spoke to have seen evidence of the alleged Russian false flag operation revealed by the US last week -- but none of them doubt the intelligence. ""What's interesting is, starting in December, the Russians were the ones promoting the idea that this war would be started by a Ukrainian false flag,"" Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy, told CNN.Schafer points to a statement made last December by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu who claimed that US mercenaries were helping Ukrainian special forces ""for active hostilities"" in eastern Ukraine. According to a transcript shared on the government's website, Shoigu alleged that supplies of an ""unidentified chemical component"" had been delivered to the region ""to carry out provocations."" The US has denied the claim. New satellite images show continuing Russian military buildup on three sides of UkraineShafer said Russian media sites ran with the claim, echoing a narrative already being pumped out on pro-Russian websites. ""What is interesting is the Russians were the ones promoting the idea that the war would be started by a Ukrainian/US-NATO false flag,"" he said. ""It has been a sort of a back and forth of the two sides accusing the other of a false flag [operation].""  In recent years, the crackdown by social media companies on Russian bots has led to higher profile voices, such as news sites and personalities like Shoigu, playing a major role in the Kremlin's drumbeat.Analysis from Schafer's team found that since November last year, Russian propagandists and news sites have claimed that: Ukraine is a failed state; Ukrainian politicians are neo-Nazis; US and NATO are to blame for the increasing likelihood of war and that -- despite amassing more than 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine's borders -- Russia is not the aggressor.The UK-based Centre for Information Resilience, where Jankowicz is a senior adviser, has seen a 200% increase in posts claiming Ukraine is the aggressor against Russia compared to this time in 2021. Online narratives around Ukrainian neo-Nazis and NATO aggression have also seen a ""huge spike in the past week,"" she said. And American media personalities have helped launder some of these talking points. In December, Fox News host Tucker Carlson reported that a ""NATO takeover of Ukraine would compromise Russia's access to its Sevastopol Naval Base.""Jankowicz said the US is badly disadvantaged ""because the issue of Russian disinformation [became] so polarized"" in the Trump era, she said. ""People hear the word Russia, and there's a huge dose of distrust that comes along with that for certain parts of the political spectrum on ... the far left and the far right.""According to the State Department, the US government has taken an active role in debunking allegations on Ukraine as it tries to stop the Kremlin from shaping the information ecosystem to fit its policy goals.Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on security camera footage at Salisbury train station on March 3, 2018, images that were released in September 2018.Declassifying information as a weapon in the fight against disinformation worked in 2018 when the British government responded to the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury with the nerve agent Novichok. The then-Prime Minister Theresa May declassified evidence ""extremely quickly while the situation was still unfolding, in order to push back against the Russian narrative,"" Jankowicz said.The details she released helped open source investigators like Bellingcat make bruising revelations about the poisoning suspects; they also cut through the hubris of the Russian government, Lomas said. The men accused of carrying out the attack were ridiculed abroad for claiming ​in an interview with the Kremlin-backed RT network that they had made the long journey  from Moscow to Salisbury for a sightseeing day trip.In the case of Russia's alleged video plot, ""there are plenty of reasons for the US public to be skeptical of US intelligence,"" Schafer said. US officials could try and mitigate that by pulling from the Salisbury playbook and releasing evidence later, he said. Alternatively, they could be frank that not providing proof ""may not be good enough for a lot of people,"" but explain that that they were unable to reveal any more.  But with the fog of war arguably thicker than ever in the digital age, cutting through may be hard to do."

The team lost to their oldest rival, Team USA, in a penalty shootout in the gold medal match at PyeongChang 2018, ending their winning streak of four consecutive Winter Games gold medals. But in Beijing at the 2022 Winter Games, they finally had their opportunity to make amends, and they seized the moment. It was nervy and exciting, but finally Canada held on to secure a 3-2 victory in the final as they saw a 3-0 lead evaporate under late pressure from Team USA.As the final buzzer sounded, Canadian players erupted into cheers of celebration, some broke into tears and bundled together into a group hug. Read More""It's just so good. It's a great feeling,"" Canadian forward Marie-Philip Poulin, who scored two goals in the final, said. ""It was one hell of an effort. This is redemption.""(Left to right) Sarah Fillier, Jill Saulnier, Renata Fast and Melodie Daoust celebrate with their gold medals after beating Team USA.Ticking downNot that they needed the extra motivation, but Canada women's ice hockey general manager Gina Kingsbury had an innovative way to help her players build up to the 2022 Winter Games. Kingsbury, a two-time Olympic champion as a player, gave each member of the Canadian women's team a clock which counted down the days and hours to the Beijing 2022 Opening Ceremony after Canada finished third in the 2019 World Championships. The clock's purpose was to focus the Canadian players, and it came particularly in handy during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We had a team slogan that was called 'Impact the Red,'"" Canada's Natalie Spooner said. ""Obviously, we couldn't be together as a team every single day, but it was impacting those days when we weren't able to be together, making sure we were improving as individuals and as a team also.""We were looking at that clock all the time. We had it in our houses, and even through Covid, we obviously weren't able to be together for a lot of that time.""So we had that clock there to make sure we did our own work on those off days to make sure we were ready when we came back as a team.""It (the clock) had how many days, hours, minutes, seconds until the Opening Ceremony on it.""Canada's players rush onto the ice in celebration after beating Team USA in the women's ice hockey gold medal match.Each player kept their clock in their own unique locations -- Spooner says she kept hers in the kitchen -- and Poulin says she'll display the clock alongside her gold medal from Beijing. And the Canadian players aren't ruling out resetting the clock for Cortina in 2026. Spooner said: ""The clock is at zero now, but if they re-start the clock for the next four years then maybe (she will put it next to the gold medal).""""Might as well,"" Poulin said when asked whether she will reset it.'Pretty numb'For defending champion Team USA, it was a painful end to its Olympics campaign. The team showed grit and determination to fight its way back into the final, but came up just short in its search for what would be a game-tying goal. US goaltender Alex Cavallini says she felt ""pretty numb"" in the aftermath of the defeat. But for her personally, it was also a ""pretty special"" moment because of the injuries she was battling through. ""I actually tore my MCL (in mid-January 2022) and didn't even know if I was going to make it on the flight here,"" Cavallini explained. ""I didn't have a full practice until three days into when we got here. Our third practice in was when I actually practiced. Didn't know if I was going to get a start or not.""For me to be able to battle it out, thanks to our amazing staff and coaching staff to believe in me even when I didn't and support me along the way -- that was a huge deal for me to even get minutes here.""Alex Carpenter, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Amanda Kessel line up for their silver medals after the women's ice hockey gold medal match.It was a campaign fraught with adversity for Team USA, having lost star player Brianna Decker to a broken leg in the first game.Decker's US teammate, Lee Stecklein, helped push her onto the ice on her scooter to receiver her silver medal. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosAnd Stecklein paid tribute to Decker's impact on the whole squad by remaining with the team.  ""There is no doubt she was going to stay here and be part of this team. The pain she went through, I can't even imagine. ""But for her to be with us means a lot. I know it wasn't easy for her all the time, but we love her very much."""

Valieva declared both of these on a doping control form, according to a court application allegedly filed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in a case raised after it came to light that Valieva tested positive for a banned substance in December.Kamila Valieva of Team ROC skates during the women's singles competition on Tuesday in Beijing.The London-based Dossier Center, an investigative website run by an exiled Russian businessman, published part of the WADA court application online and it was reviewed for CNN by Travis Tygart, head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). The Dossier Center did not publish the doping control form or the test report exhibited in the case, and CNN has not reviewed them.Russian skater Kamila Valieva breaks into tears after taking to ice for first time since controversial doping scandal rulingCNN has reached out to the CAS and the parties involved in Valieva's arbitration hearing to confirm the validity of the court application published by the Dossier Center and has yet to hear back. CNN has also reached out to the WADA accredited lab in Sweden which tested Valieva's sample from December for comment. Tygart, who is not involved in the investigation into the Russian skater, described the application published by the Dossier Center as ""accurate and legitimate."" The 15-year-old skater has been in the spotlight since it emerged days into the Olympics that she tested positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine, which experts say can enhance endurance. Valieva has sought to blame the positive test on contamination from medication taken by her grandfather, an IOC official familiar with the CAS hearing said on Tuesday.Read MoreThe presence of the additional substances raises further questions about the skater's drug use, according to Tygart. USADA tried to ban Hypoxen in 2017 due to its performance-enhancing capabilities, but that ban was not implemented, Tygart told CNN. ""It raises a whole host of questions that have yet to be determined and what appears to be the case of a pretty deliberate attempt to use substances in order to enhance performance,"" Tygart said.""The picture it paints is, you've got a ​15-year-old. Does she have the wherewithal and the knowledge and the financial resources to find and use two drugs, one of which is prohibited TMZ (Trimetazidine) and another one Hypoxen, [along with] L-carnitine (a supplement) -- to increase endurance and reduce fatigue?,"" he said.According to the application published by the Dossier Center, Valieva's mother testified in a provisional hearing that the athlete took one of the substances, Hypoxen, ""to treat 'heart variations.'""Supradyn, which can be used as an immunity boosting supplement, was also listed on Valieva's doping control form, according to the application.ROC at Beijing 2022: What is it and how can Russian athletes compete at the Olympics?Valieva's positive test for trimetazidine, though taken in December, was only analyzed and reported to Russia's anti-doping agency in February, resulting in Valieva's suspension on February 8 -- a day after she helped propel the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to a gold-medal finish in the figure skating team event. But the skater was reinstated after an appeal, and the CAS on Monday allowed her to compete in the Olympics, citing specific provisions related to her protected status as minor, while investigations into any doping violations by Valieva and the adults responsible for her training continue. An emotional Valieva came out at the top after the short program of the women's singles competition on Tuesday. She will compete in the second portion of the event -- where she is the favorite for gold -- on Thursday. Russian athletes competing at the Olympics are already under the shadow of a history of illegal doping: WADA barred Russia from international competitions in 2019 over doping violations. Under the ban set to expire later this year, they've only been able to participate as neutrals in the Games."

""We had not a brilliant day, but a good enough day to be the deserved winner.""Mo Salah might be the best Premier League player ever but is the 'unprecedented' Liverpool forward still underrated?'We needed to be ready to suffer'A high-tempo opening to the game saw Liverpool start quickly, with Mane -- newly crowned Africa Cup of Nations hero with Senegal -- squandering two of the visitors' best early chances.Inter were inches away from taking the lead when Ivan Perisic's low cross found Hakan Çalhanoğlu, the Turkish midfielder crashing a thunderous strike off the underside of Alisson's crossbar.Mane went close with an audacious acrobatic effort in the first half.With Perisic spearheading a surging start to the second-half for Inter, Klopp rung the changes. A triple substitution just before the hour-mark saw Elliot, Fabinho and Mane depart with Naby Keita, Jordan Henderson and new-signing Diaz enter. But it was the half-time substitute, Firmino, who made the breakthrough, the Brazilian darting across Alessandro Bastoni to superbly head an Andy Robertson corner across goalkeeper Samir Handanovic and just inside the far post.The goal had come against the run of play, yet within 10 minutes Liverpool had doubled their lead. Salah reacted fastest to captain Virgil van Dijk's nod down to rattle -- via a deflection -- a shot past a helpless Handanovic.It was Salah's eighth goal in seven Champions League matches this season.Perisic (L) proved a constant threat down Inter's left side.Having seen out the closing stages, Van Dijk said that Inter's dominance during periods of the game hadn't come as a surprise to Liverpool""Everyone expected to be under pressure, because they are a very good team and it is the Champions League,"" Van Dijk told BT Sport.""We needed to be ready to suffer and do the hard work, and we definitely did. Happy days.""Bayern woes continueIn Wednesday's other Champions League fixture, Kingsley Coman spared Bayern Munich's blushes as a disappointing week for the German club continued with a 1-1 draw against Red Bull Salzburg in Austria. Chikwubuike Adamu celebrates scoring the opening goal.Still reeling from Saturday's stunning 4-2 defeat to Vfl Bochum in the Bundesliga -- wherein they are pursuing a tenth straight title -- Bayern fell behind to Chukwubuike Adamu's first-half strike. Salzburg's valiant defending looked to have secured a famous win before Coman tapped home a heartbreaking injury time equalizer."

Lynch, who was the first Black female attorney general in US history, will defend the NFL in the racial discrimination lawsuit filed by Flores earlier this month, along with Brad Karp of the Paul, Weiss firm, according to NFL vice president of communications Brian McCarthy. Lynch joined the firm, which also represented the league on concussion issues, in 2019. Lynch led an independent investigation into Syracuse University's Department of Public Safety in the wake of student protests in 2020 over the university's handling of racist incidents on campus.When asked about the NFL hiring Lynch, the legal team representing Flores did not comment.The Dolphins fired Flores in January, and the team announced Mike McDaniel as their next head coach earlier this month. Flores was 24-25 in his three years with the Dolphins, including a 9-8 record this past season when Miami missed qualifying for the playoffs.Read MoreIn his lawsuit against the NFL and three teams -- the Dolphins, Denver Broncos and New York Giants -- Flores alleges that after the regular season, the Giants interviewed him for their vacant head coaching job under disingenuous circumstances, claiming he had found out three days before his interview that the Giants had already decided to hire Brian Daboll. The Giants organization earlier this month issued a statement standing by its process and decision to hire Daboll.Former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores sues NFL and 3 NFL teams alleging racial discrimination""We are pleased and confident with the process that resulted in the hiring of Brian Daboll,"" the team's statement read. ""We interviewed an impressive and diverse group of candidates. The fact of the matter is, Brian Flores was in the conversation to be our head coach until the eleventh hour. Ultimately, we hired the individual we felt was most qualified to be our next head coach.""Flores alleges in his lawsuit that his interview with the Giants was a ruse so the team could ""demonstrate falsely to League Commissioner Roger Goodell and the public at large that it was in compliance with the Rooney Rule.""The NFL instituted the Rooney Rule in 2003 in an effort to increase diversity among the NFL's head coaching, general manager and executive ranks. The rule requires every team to interview at least two external minority candidates for open head coaching positions, according to the NFL's Football Operations website.As of Wednesday, there are only two Black head coaches in the NFL -- Pittsburgh Steelers' Mike Tomlin and Houston Texans' Lovie Smith -- in a league where nearly 70% of the players are Black.JUST WATCHEDEx-NFL coach speaks out about 'humiliating' Bill Belichick textReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEx-NFL coach speaks out about 'humiliating' Bill Belichick text 02:57Three other head coaches of color lead their teams: Washington Commanders' Ron Rivera, who is of Puerto Rican and Mexican descent, New York Jets' Robert Saleh, who is of Lebanese descent, and McDaniel, who is multiracial.Following the announcement of the lawsuit in February, the NFL issued a statement calling Flores' allegations meritless.""The NFL and our clubs are deeply committed to ensuring equitable employment practices and continue to make progress in providing equitable opportunities throughout our organizations,"" the league said in its statement. ""Diversity is core to everything we do, and there are few issues on which our clubs and our internal leadership team spend more time. We will defend against these claims, which are without merit.""Flores alleges he had a 'sham interview' with BroncosFlores' lawsuit makes a claim of another ""sham interview,"" this one with the Denver Broncos in 2019. Flores says that ""Broncos' then-General Manager John Elway, President and Chief Executive Officer Joe Ellis and others showed up an hour late to the interview"" and adds that the Broncos' delegation ""looked completely disheveled, and it was obvious that they had drinking heavily the night before.""The Denver Broncos strongly challenged Flores' lawsuit, saying, ""The allegations from Brian Flores directed toward the Denver Broncos in today's court filing are blatantly false.""JUST WATCHEDEx-NFL coach says owner offered him money to lose gamesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEx-NFL coach says owner offered him money to lose games 03:28""Our process was thorough and fair to determine the most qualified candidate for our head coaching position,"" the team's statement continued. Elway also released a statement rejecting Flores' claims. ""I took Coach Flores very seriously as a candidate for our head coaching position in 2019 and enjoyed our three-and-a-half hour interview with him. Along with the rest of our group, I was prepared, ready and fully engaged during the entire interview as Brian shared his experience and vision for our team,"" Elway's statement this month read. ""For Brian to make an assumption about my appearance and state of mind early that morning was subjective, hurtful and just plain wrong. If I appeared 'disheveled,' as he claimed, it was because we had flown in during the middle of the night -- immediately following another interview in Denver -- and were going on a few hours of sleep to meet the only window provided to us,"" Elway's statement read.Biden says NFL needs to live up to its words on hiring more Black coachesFlores says Dolphins' owner Stephen Ross offered to pay Flores to purposely lose games in order to secure a higher pick in the NFL draft and encouraged Flores to purposely violate league tampering rules. Flores says when he refused, Ross then led a campaign to treat Flores with ""disdain and held out as someone who was noncompliant and difficult to work with.""The Dolphins responded to Flores' allegations, saying in part, ""We vehemently deny any allegations of racial discrimination and are proud of the diversity and inclusion throughout our organization. The implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect. We will be withholding further comment on the lawsuit at this time.""CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report. "

That's because they have conditioned their bodies and brains to quash that dizzying feeling, experts say.

""I think we have a learned ability against the momentum that hits us while we're spinning,"" she says.US Olympic medalist Mirai Nagasu  skates at Bryant Park in New York City.Kathleen Cullen, a professor of biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University, has a more scientific answer. She studies the vestibular system, which is responsible for our sense of balance and motion, and says spinning without stumbling from dizziness is an art perfected over time. At the start of their careers, skaters and other athletes feel dizzy when they spin around, Cullen says. But ultimately, they train their brains to better interpret that feeling. ""There's a really profound fundamental thing that happens in the brain of people like dancers or skaters over lots and lots of practice. And that's basically a change in the way the brain is processing information,"" Cullen says. ""When you spin around, you're activating the semicircular canals, rotation sensors. They're filled with fluid and they're sensing your rotation. But when you stop, the fluid has inertia and it tends to continue to move. They actually get a false sensation of movement.""Over years of training, figure skaters' brains have adapted and learned to ignore this error, she says.""This is done over time with each practice session, day by day, as the brain compares its expectations with what it is actually pulling in from its sensory receptors.""Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue of Team USA skate on day 10 of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games on February 14, 2022.In short, Cullen says, most people feel like the world's still whirling even after they stop spinning. But Olympians, and skaters in particular, generally do not because their brains have changed to suppress the feeling. Athletes also learn ways to reduce their dizziness. For example, focusing on a fixed reference or stationary object minimizes dizziness and loss of balance. ""Ballet dancers often whip their head around during each turn to fixate a visual reference. Similarly, at the end of the spin, athletes will fixate their eyes at a specific spot on the wall to provide a fixed reference,"" Cullen says. Figure skater Zhu Yi of China competes in the women's short program at the 2022 Winter Olympics.The brain and the inner ear are in constant communication with the body and one another to achieve balance, says Brigid Dwyer, an assistant professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine. ""For most people, however, dizziness is only a potential issue during faster and more forceful activities,"" Dwyer says. ""Amazingly, when needed, our brains can be prompted over time to better handle the dizzying tasks we encounter.""Here are some other common Google search queries about figure skating:Why do some figure skaters wear tights over their boots?Nagasu says it all comes down to personal choice. Some people wear tights over their boots if their boots are scuffed up, she says. Others, like Courtney Hicks, a gold medalist at the 2013 US International Figure Skating Classic, say wearing tights over boots helps elongate the look of their legs.  But trends have changed in recent years, with a lot of skaters opting to wear tights that show off their boots, Nagasu says. Courtney Hicks of the US performs during a women's singles free skating event in Nagano, Japan, in November 2015.       What's the 'kiss and cry' area?After their program, figure skaters wait for their scores at the aptly named ""kiss and cry"" rinkside area. Here, spectators get a glimpse of the athletes at one of their most tense moments. Many figure skaters celebrate with kisses with their coaches -- although not so much in the pandemic, as they are often masked -- or dissolve into tears of disappointment.""It's supposed to be a pun. You either give kisses over how happy your score is or it's so bad you literally cry,"" Nagasu says.  Kaori Sakamoto of Team Japan reacts after hearing her score during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Why do some figure skaters wear gloves?Skaters can easily take a tumble. And slapping the ice at high velocity is no fun. ""Ice can be rough when you're falling, especially when you're factoring the height at which we fall from and the momentum from our rotations,"" Nagasu says.  Gloves also keep the skaters' hands warm during the competition. In a highly competitive sport where the tiniest advantage can make a difference, many athletes are leaving nothing to chance."
sport,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/sport/womens-figure-skating-scoring-explainer/index.html,Here's how women's figure skating is now scored (and why stamina often leads to more points),"By Holly Yan, CNN"," (CNN)Gone are the days when Olympic figure skating was scored solely at the judges' discretion, with subjective points awarded on a 6.0 scale.A 2002 Olympic figure skating scandal -- with allegations of score-fixing -- upended the sport and led to a complete overhaul of the scoring system -- one that awards more points for stamina and strenuous athletic feats. Now, another Olympic skating controversy has gripped die-hard and casual fans alike. Gold-medal favorite Kamila Valieva, 15, gave a test sample that later tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine on December 25, the day she won the Russian national championship.Russian skating star Kamila Valieva cleared to skate at Beijing GamesTrimetazidine is a medication that can increase stamina and make ""your heart work more efficiently,"" said  Dr. Elizabeth Murray, pediatric emergency medicine physician at the University of Rochester Medical Center.Read MoreBut the positive result wasn't announced by the World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited Swedish lab until February 8, a day after Valieva and her Russian Olympic Committee teammates won gold in the team competition. An Olympic official said Valieva blamed the positive test on a mix-up with her grandfather's medication. The skater's coach, Eteri Tutberidze, told Russian state news agency Tass her entourage is ""absolutely sure"" she is innocent.Valieva was allowed to compete for more gold in the Olympic women's individual figure skating event. Her routine for the free skate -- the final portion of the women's competition -- features quadruple jumps that are untouchable by most of her competitors. Here's how the sport has evolved in recent years to reward increased athleticism and stamina: More difficult jumps = more pointsIn 2004, the International Skating Union ditched the subjective ""6.0"" scoring system for the more rubric-based International Judging System that gives certain base points for jumps depending on their degree of difficulty and how many times the skater rotates in the air.Kamila Valieva competes for the first time since a controversial doping scandal rulingFor example, a quadruple Lutz -- in which a skater makes four revolutions in the air -- carries more base points than a triple Lutz. But a triple Lutz carries more base points than less difficult triples, such as a triple loop or a triple Salchow. After each jump, skaters can gain or lose points from the base value depending on the grade of execution -- how well or poorly they executed the jump.All those numbers are part of the technical score. There's also the presentation score, which rewards artistry and skating skills between jumps. But in recent years, skaters have been able to win competitions largely due to points racked up from jumping -- with quadruple jumps playing a larger role in men's and women's skating. Why better stamina can win skaters more pointsIn women's figure skating, athletes perform two routines: the short program, which is about 2 minutes and 40 seconds long, and the free skate, which is about 4 minutes long. Russian skater Alina Zagitova was 15 when she won Olympic gold after performing all her free skate jumps in the second half of the routine.With the current scoring system, jumps performed in the second half of the free skate can get a 10% bonus because it's more difficult to perform them on tired legs. 2018 Olympic champion Alina Zagitova, who was also coached by Tutberidze, capitalized on this and put all her triple jumps in the second half of her free skate. The 15-year-old Russian won Olympic gold and was celebrated by President Vladimir Putin. Russian President Vladimir Putin presents Alina Zagitova with an Order of Friendship following the Russian teen's Olympic win in 2018.But critics denounced Zagitova's method of winning, saying the teen's performance lacked artistry or relied too heavily on jumps crammed in the second half of the routine to maximize points. After the widespread criticism in 2018, the International Skating Union created a new rule saying skaters will only get 10% bonuses for up to three jumping passes in the second half of their free skate. The new rule has been dubbed the ""Zagitova rule."" Since the last Olympics, women's figure skating has been dominated by Russian teenagers such as Kamila Valieva, Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova. Even if Kamila Valieva wins, she losesAll three have won international championships after adding quadruple jumps in their routines -- an enormous athletic feat.Valieva became the first individual female skater to land a quad at the Olympics when she helped Russian skaters win the team event last week. But if Valieva places first after the women's final, she might not get an Olympic medal around her neck for a while -- if at all.  The International Olympic Committee's executive board said this week that there would be no medal ceremonies for the completed team event or the women's skating competition -- should Valieva place in the top three in that event -- until it's determined whether the skater had violated anti-doping regulations.CNN's Simone McCarthy, Hannah Ritchie and George Ramsay contributed to this report.

""They flew us up in the helicopters at the top of the mountain to meet the skiers for lunch. And growing up in England and spending most of my DJ career in warmer climates. ""I'd never experienced anything like this before, I was just taken aback by the surroundings.

Jamaica's flag bearers Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian (L) and Benjamin Alexander enter the stadium leading Jamaica's delegation during the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, at the National Stadium, known as the Bird's Nest, in Beijing, on February 4, 2022.A few months later, in February of 2016, Alexander had his first lesson in Whistler and ""it's just been kind of a steady progression since,"" he says modestly.Initially, Alexander wanted to get good enough at skiing to keep up with his friends.The youngest and oldest Winter Olympians competing at Beijing 2022 ""As I got good enough to kind of keep up with them socially, being the only black representative in the group but on top of that being of Jamaican heritage, people kept throwing sideways jokes about 'Cool Runnings,'"" added Alexander, referring to the 1993 hit film about the unlikely story of the Jamaican four-man bobsleigh team's bid to get to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary, Alexander went to the PyeongChang Games in 2018 as a spectator, and started to wonder if he could compete at that level.""One of the things I noticed, other than thoroughly enjoying the spirit of the Olympics, was that there were only three Jamaican athletes in attendance. ""It took me aback knowing how strong Jamaica is in the Summer Games, knowing how popular that movie 'Cool Runnings' is.""I kind of had this idea in the back of my head: let's see if this is possible. I thought the most likely outcome was death or at least a serious injury,"" he told CNN.Alexander poses for a photo during a training session at the Kolasin ski resort on December 21, 2021.'Absolutely fearless'So Alexander booked a month-long trip back to Canada to ski, where he met former Europa Cup level ski racer, American Gordon Gray.""When we sat down for lunch, he said, ""Okay, I'll be brutally honest. Your technique -- absolutely atrocious -- the worst I've ever seen."" But to Alexander's surprise the Jamaican could keep up with the American, who had been skiing for 40 years. Despite critiquing Alexander's technique the American skier told the Jamaican that he was ""absolutely fearless.""According to Alexander, Gray added: 'If you're afraid you're never gonna get any work done, even with all the technique in the world. But if you're fearless, then we can teach you technique and I think there's a chance.""Alexander was among a dozen athletes -- including others from far-flung warmer climates like  Morocco, Ghana, and East Timor -- competing in Montenegro's Kolasin in Decemer 2021, where skiers were hoping to rack up points in a final dash to qualify for the games in Beijing next year.In just 22 months, Alexander shaved down his FIS race points from over 600 to under the required 160 point minimum. By January, he had secured the last of the 160 International Ski Federation (FIS) points needed to qualify for the games by finishing seventh in the giant slalom at the Cape Verde National Ski Championships in Liechtenstein.Fast forward to 2022 and Alexander will on Sunday represent Jamaica in the Winter Games. ""Qualification -- that was the finish line that I was running towards everything else now above, above and beyond. This is just the icing on the cake.

""I am from a working class background -- my parents were both drivers, my father was a bus driver for most of his career, and no one in my immediate family skied,"" said Alexander, who wants his story to be a ""beacon of light"" and show ""it is still possible to get there.""""I think the important point is it's going to be hard at the start, but you just have to persevere."""

Though these skiers have a trick up their sleeve -- or, more accurately, a trick galloping at the other end of their rope. Yeehaw! Don your cowboy hat and canter into the wild world of western-style skijoring -- otherwise known as ""Ben Hur on snow,"" HistoryRead MoreExhibited at St Moritz, Switzerland in 1928, skijoring holds the honor of being the first ever demonstration sport at a Winter Olympics, yet the discipline's origins extend well beyond its Games debut. Practiced differently across continents, the history of skijoring is a complex one. Fortunately, there exists a one-woman fountain of knowledge for all things skijoring in Loren Zhimanskova, President of SkijorUSA and Skijor International.A key coordinator for American skijoring and central to the sport's growing reputation in the region, Zhimanskova's passion for skijoring is matched only by her seemingly endless knowledge of its history and its people.Born in Europe, skijoring has taken many forms over the years. It began with skiers being pulled by reindeer in Lapland, before trying their hand behind horses, dogs and -- popularized in the 1950s -- behind motorcycles and cars.Zhimanskova has even heard of skijorers being towed by airplanes, though she insists that riders let go before take-off. St Moritz's frozen lake -- host to the glitzy annual White Turf event since 1907 -- has been described as the sport's spiritual home, but skijoring took a trip across the Atlantic not long after and has since blossomed into an ever-growing discipline in America. To rider or not to rider?The central difference to the European version of skijoring is that in the US, the horse has a rider.While in Switzerland many competitors grow up on horse ranches and ski, in the US most are either very accomplished horsemen or very accomplished skiers.For many American riders and skiers, the start line will be the first time they meet each other. ""They just put their talents together and give it their best shot -- it's fun that way,"" Zhimanskova told CNN.  At White Turf, competitors will race twice around a full flat oval track -- leaving gates at the same time -- whereas the Western style sees skijorers navigate an obstacle course spotted with jumps, hoops to collect, and gates to pass through in a time-trial format.White Turf has been described as the ""playground of the rich and famous,"" with sponsors ranging from BMW to Credit Suisse, and Zhimanskova finally realized her dream of experiencing the glamor first-hand in 2016.""When I walked onto that frozen lake, I felt like this was hallowed ground,"" Zhimanskova said.""As a historian, I'm really here and I'm really going to see this. And it was every bit as spectacular as I had imagined.""It also gave Zhimanskova the opportunity to share with locals how the sport was being done differently in the US. Their reaction? ""You're crazy.""""They had no idea how we were skijoring here,"" Zhimanskova said.""And I said, 'Well that's funny you say that because when I describe how you do skijoring in Switzerland ... we think you're crazy!' So we had a good laugh.""American hospitalityIf White Turf is the Monaco Grand Prix of skijoring, does the US have a Super Bowl equivalent?Despite some old events like Leadville, Colorado -- a 73-year-old venue that sees competitors race through the town's main street -- the US does not have a showpiece event, yet this is by design.The soul of American Skijoring is its sprawling diversity and uniqueness from venue to venue. Whilst White Turf takes place once a year across three Sundays in February, the US skijoring season runs from early January to mid March with venues spread from Calgary down the spine of the Rocky Mountains to Ridgeway.Whilst racers can expect a broadly similar format in terms of track length and snow depth, all races are independently run -- each sculpted to the desires of the organizers. Some events, like Leadville, are run down a main street. Others take place on rodeo grounds or in a hay field. All have different prize pots -- ranging as high as $40,000 to a simple jackpot made up of registration fees. Some races will even reward the victorious skijorer with a horse or custom saddle.Incorporating skijoring as the center-piece of a wider weekend festival -- flushed with food and live music -- is an increasingly popular trend, but two-day, standalone racing formats remain. A new event in Canterbury Park, Minnesota offers a hugely popular freestyle event -- showcasing skiers letting go of the ropes over jumps to do tricks in front of growing crowds of over 10,000. A newly emerged snowboarding division also continues to blossom.""Everybody really does want to do it their way ... I respect this, it is the nature of sport in the US to be supple,"" Zhimanskova said.""I think as a community we're very united, it's just that all of our events need to have their own local flavor.""Cowboy camaraderieAs such, Zhimanskova and SkijorUSA acts as the coordinating central hub of skijoring in the region.Supported by Zhimanskova's relentless efforts, skijoring in the US has enjoyed a golden age over the last decade. Some 23 races are slated for 2022, with two more potentially to come in Canada.Despite skijoring's US expansion and the swathes of new faces, the core community remains incredibly tight knit. For Zhimanskova, permanently on the road, this camaraderie lies at the heart of her love for the sport.""When I travel, I don't like to feel like a tourist,"" Zhimanskova said.""I like to integrate, I like to be able to hang out with people at the local bar and just chat about life in that town. Everybody's having a great time and everybody's helping each other, which is wonderful. ""Yes it's a competition, but it's that kind of rodeo cowboy culture where you need to have your buddy's back because you never know when your horse trailer is gonna break down and you're going to need somebody to help you.""Joe Loveridge, competitor and organizer of Friday's big event in Utah, could not agree more.""I love the camaraderie, the adrenaline, and that anyone can do it,"" Loveridge told CNN.""There's no better way to blend a ski town loaded with skiers and the western heritage and cowboy life.""The sport brings together different types of folks and provides some high-paced action and also allows new and young people to participate.""The Cowboy Channel will broadcast five skijoring races annually, and Zhimanskova is working towards a number of potentially high-profile sponsorships including Justin Boots and Cinch Jeans.There's even been interest in a reality TV show to potentially follow some of the sport's eccentric personalities around the circuit. Operation OlympicsWhilst Zhimanskova is doubtful that skijoring would ever be slated on the official Olympic schedule -- citing reasons surrounding the Games' complicated relationship with animals -- she would be keen to reignite the demonstration tradition or incorporate it into the opening ceremony for a forthcoming Games.Not least because 2028 marks the 100th anniversary of skijoring at the Olympics and there's a prospect of Salt Lake City potentially being the host city for the 2030 or 2034 Games.Picture the scene: a cowboy or cowgirl riding a horse into the opening ceremony bearing the American flag, followed in tow by a skier carrying the Olympic torch.""I think it really represents the American spirit,"" Zhimanskova said.""The freedom, the love for the outdoors and the environment, the ability to come together from different backgrounds, different worlds and compete as a team. ""Of course, the horse is also just an iconic animal that's been so important to our growth as a country."""

While the industry as a whole is still male-dominated, organizations have launched projects in the hope of creating a more diverse gaming environment.An example of this is the Valorant Game Changers initiative which looks to provide a platform for marginalized genders to compete and develop into professional players. Valorant is a first-person shooting game developed by Riot Games -- of League of Legends fame -- and has approximately 12 million players logging in each month.The Game Changers series runs alongside the main competition and looks to foster marginalized talent in a safe environment away from any potential harassment. Read MoreRiot Games' Senior Brand Manager Vera Wienken has worked closely on launching the initiative and says it's already been a success. ""It is very important to us to have real representation of the community within esports, within our pro players, coaches, managers,"" she told CNN Sport.""Therefore, we founded Game Changers and really hope to see that, in the future, esports overall becomes more diverse.""READ: Esports is on the rise in Africa and these two Kenyans are leading the chargeJUST WATCHEDMeet the UAE's first female esports teamReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet the UAE's first female esports team 03:50'You don't need to sing it to the world'Wienken says representation is key to attracting and maintaining female participation in Valorant and esports in general. Valorant itself is a relatively new game and Wienken thinks its format and narrative open itself up to a more diverse audience. The characters you can play as, for example, don't necessarily conform to gender stereotypes and this helps make the game more accessible, says Wienken.The gaming world often overlooks players of color. This new studio is changing that""There's a lack of role models,"" she added when asked why the industry is still attracting less women than men.""What we would like to see and what's happening already, which is amazing, is these women pro players are becoming role models for others and sharing their path, sharing their story so that women know and find their entry points."" Valorant EMEA host Yinsu Collins is one of the many to have suffered from online harassment during her career in esports, but she says she's developed a thick skin in order to ignore it. The journalist, who previously worked in traditional sports media, says Valorant has helped educate people within the industry of the discrimination marginalized groups face. ""I don't think I've ever seen a title that has produced and invested in a female scene this quickly,"" she told CNN Sport.""The way Riot were like: 'We're going to prioritize the women's side. We're not going to wait three or four years to kind of give you guys a big tournament. We're just going to do it right off the bat.'""I just think the dedication, the investment, obviously, you can see the way Riot is prioritizing having diversity.""And you don't need to sing it to the world, you just do it through your actions.""READ: How esports has helped its fans get through lockdownThose within esports hope for a day when gender is no longer spoken about. What does progress look like?While Collins has been sent negative messages on social media, she has also seen people reflect on their past actions. She says she occasionally gets messages from boys who want to apologize for certain things they've said or the way they've behaved online in the past. 'The sky's the limit on where this can go' -- The worlds of Fortnite and football collide""Hopefully, in a few years, maybe a decade's time, we wouldn't even have to talk about representation because it would just be a normal thing,"" Collins added. Wienken says Game Changers has already had a huge impact on the amount of women playing and watching the game and there is more to come from the initiative, with this year's launch of the Game Changers Academy.This new, community-driven format hopes to act as a stepping stone for young women who are interested in making it as a professional esports player.By creating these new entry points for women, Wienken hopes that there won't be a need for female-led projects such as the one she works with in the future.""I hope that we don't see gender anymore when we are looking at the professional players, and we might not even need Game Changers anymore in the future because it's just so normal that esports is diverse,"" she added. For Collins, progress is all about how the media and wider society frame women in esports. She's aware it will take time but is looking forward to the day when women in the industry aren't always asked to talk about their gender. ""Every single time a talent line up is being announced or every single time we talk about Game Changers, I want the conversations to be about how the competition is amazing or this player has a great personality or just the crazy storylines. The same way we talk about men's sport, really,"" she said. ""I think if we can get to a point where women's esports and female talent aren't just being talked about because of their gender, but they're actually being talked about because they're good at what they do, I'll be pretty satisfied."""

After a long drive that included 15 plays -- four runs and 10 passes -- Kupp scored a crucial touchdown, giving the Rams a three-point lead. The Bengals had an opportunity to answer back, but were unable to convert on fourth down, ending the game. Kupp -- who had eight receptions for 92 yards and two touchdowns -- was named Super Bowl MVP on Sunday. Kupp was also named NFL's offensive player of the year Thursday.The Rams came to the Super Bowl looking to redeem themselves after losing the big game in 2019 against the New England Patriots. That game saw head coach Sean McVay making his Super Bowl debut as the youngest ever to coach a team in the Super Bowl, according to the NFL. Super Bowl halftime show brought all the hip-hop heatStafford also had something to prove. This was his first season with the Rams after playing his first 12 seasons in the NFL with the Detroit Lions. McVay said a few weeks ago the team wouldn't be where it is today without Stafford's leadership.The Rams solidified themselves as ""Hollywood's Team"" after returning to the City of Angels in 2016 from St. Louis. Between Los Angeles and St. Louis, the Rams have made five Super Bowl appearances, with their only other championship win in 2000, in Super Bowl XXXIV.CNN's David Close and Claire Colbert contributed to this report.

""Dad jokes and puns, mostly,"" is what LeDec quips as being key to the duo's success. ""And a lot of hard work ... we can work super hard and push ourselves beyond what we knew was possible.""The American pair say their bond off the ice influences how they perform on it, propelling them to new heights in their skating careers. After winning their second national title last month, Cain-Gribble and LeDuc are now preparing to compete in their first Winter Olympics in Beijing. It will be a landmark moment regardless of how they perform in the pairs events with LeDuc, who identifies as gay, set to become the first out, nonbinary athlete to compete at the Winter Olympics, according to Team USA. Read MoreFor the duo, who have been competing together since 2016 and have both taken breaks from competitive pairs skating, the build-up to the Games has been a chance to reflect on their own journeys.Cain-Gribble (left) and LeDuc compete at last month's US Figure Skating Championships in Nashville, Tennessee. Frequently, they say, they have found themselves at odds with skating's norms and expectations during the course of their careers. ""For a long time, Timothy and I didn't see ourselves represented, and so we didn't quite feel like we belonged,"" Cain-Gribble tells CNN Sport. ""And for a long time, people had things to say about us. Even when we teamed up, they had a lot of things to say about my body, or about Timothy's sexuality. People still will make those comments.""Cain-Gribble, who at five-foot-six is taller than most women who compete in pairs skating, has previously spoken about how body shaming almost forced her to retire from the sport. She adds: ""I think for us, it's about leading with authenticity, being our true selves out there and creating a very inclusive environment.""Cultivating that environment has meant doing things their own way, including when it comes to their costumes. The pair wear similar colors and patterns, while Cain-Gribble often competes in a long-sleeved unitard, rather than a dress. Their free skate program -- which they call ""Two Pillars of Strength"" and perform to music from the ""W.E."" soundtrack by Abel Korzeniowski -- is about ""showcasing two equally strong skaters,"" according to Erica Rand, the author of ""Red Nails, Black Skates.""""They are doing a lot of the same moves, similar things: throw jumps, lifts, side-by-side jumps together,"" Rand tells CNN Sport.""I also see a lot of emphasis on just the strong skating work. You also see that in other skaters, it's not a unique thing, but just the emphasis on some matching work in their spirals -- which is the term for skating arabesques -- and just a feeling of huge power.""Cain-Gribble and LeDuc have chosen not to portray romantic stories with their programs, as is often the case in pairs figure skating.""The girl is very fragile, or she is kind of the flower, the man comes in to save the woman, or it's a romantic Romeo and Juliet story that's often told,"" LeDuc tells CNN Sport. ""There's nothing inherently wrong with those stories, but often they're centralized and seen as the only narratives that you can portray, the only story that's worthy of being a champion or being successful. ""Ashley and I are just different in that way; we've never done a romantic story and we've never been a romantic pair. We've always been about equality and showing two amazing athletes coming together to create something beautiful.""Cain-Gribble and LeDuc won their second national title ahead of the Winter Olympics. 'Artistry and athleticism'On the way to winning their national title in Nashville, Tennessee, last month, Cain-Gribble and LeDuc topped the previous US scoring record in the short program with 79.39 points before wrapping up the title with 145.84 points in the free skate. That helped them to qualify for Beijing 2022 alongside Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier, the 2021 US champions who missed this year's competition after Frazier contracted Covid-19. But long before their masterful performance at the national championships, Cain-Gribble and LeDuc -- who are coached by the former's parents, Peter and Darlene Cain, and Nina Mozer -- each had doubts about the future of their careers. LeDuc left professional skating for two years in 2014 and spent time working on a cruise ship, while Cain-Gribble -- whose father was a professional figure skater and represented Australia at the 1980 Winter Olympics -- says she was ready to retire from skating before switching from singles to pairs with LeDuc in 2016. The chance to skate at an Olympics is a happy twist in their up-and-down skating journeys, as well as the culmination of their long-standing ambitions.""I started dreaming about the Olympics the second I saw it ... I just fell in love with this amazing mix of artistry and athleticism, and I knew I had to be a part of it,"" says LeDuc.""Being an Olympian, whether we made this team or not, is about pursuing excellence and about pursuing a dream,"" they add, ""and that's something that Ashley and I have worked a lot of years to do.""Cain-Gribble and LeDuc perform at last year's Figure Skating World Championships in Stockholm, Sweden.When it comes to being the first American nonbinary Winter Olympian, LeDuc hopes to use the platform to empower other athletes: ""Hopefully ... people watching us can feel like they can lead with authenticity, that they don't feel like they have to change things about themselves in order to reach their success in sport and to chase their dreams. ""Ashley and I have both had to forge our own paths in order to find our success. And we did that being authentically ourselves and leading with what makes us different and unique. ""I'm hopeful that's what the narrative centers around and not necessarily around me.""'Strong skating work'Authenticity is central to the duo's skating philosophy, but it's something that can be hard to come by in a sport so entrenched in tradition -- as Rand, professor of art and visual culture and of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College, explains. ""It wasn't until July 2021 that the International Skating Union changed the category of women skaters from officially being called 'ladies' to now being called 'women,'"" says Rand.JUST WATCHEDUS speed skater Maame Biney preparing for second OlympicsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS speed skater Maame Biney preparing for second Olympics 02:54""To me, that really shows you a lot about how traditional this sport has been because the idea that women are supposed to be ladies is reflected in things like costume expectation, makeup, etc."" Cain-Gribble and LeDuc, however, have bucked some of those trends. ""Ashley Cain-Gribble is not a typical women's pair skater ... One reason that they both appeal to each other is that she's not the typical skater characterized or nicknamed a 'little pair girl' and instead is not short and not extremely small,"" says Rand. ""You aren't ever seeing somebody looking like they're being a fragile person who's cradled or anything like that."" Now, with a chance to exhibit their authentic style on the Olympic stage, Cain-Gribble and LeDuc are looking to savor every moment in Beijing.  ""That's kind of been what we've been looking at for every competition this season -- just to get the most out of the experience,"" says LeDuc.""We want to feel that when we leave that ice, we've given everything we could."""

But that's how Rick Stanton used to feel. At school in the 1960s and 70s, he says he could swim and run, but any time a ball came towards him, he recalls a sense of ""complete panic.""And there can be no misunderstanding his stance on the matter. ""I just didn't get it at all. Not interested,"" he told CNN, as he remembered lunchtimes sitting well away from the action ""with the uncool kids who didn't kick balls around.""He jokes that he's only heard of English Premier League football teams because they're named after British cities, and he'll find himself consoling friends whose teams have lost a game with a dispassionate: ""Never mind, there'll be another match next week.""The way he describes himself, totally lacking in eye-hand coordination, it doesn't sound like anybody would have ever wanted him on their team, until one day, many decades later, Stanton finally got the call. This was a football team that didn't just want him, they needed him. Read MoreWhen the Wild Boars youth team was missing in Thailand, it was a desperate matter of life and death, and one that the world followed with bated breath. READ: Thai Navy SEAL dies from infection he contracted during cave rescueRick Stanton says the rescue attempt changed his life.Cave divingUp until the summer of 2018, not many people had heard of Stanton. But since leaving high school in the 1980s, he'd quietly established himself as the pre-eminent expert in his field: cave diving. It's a niche activity that suits his analytical mind and sense of adventure. ""It's a physical activity,"" Stanton told CNN. ""But a thinking activity with logistics and planning.""But the main thing was the opportunity to explore; the amateur person -- with no real monetary means -- could explore somewhere that no one else has been before. Thai boys trapped in cave meet divers at event recounting ordeal""The whole surface of the world has been photographed, but if you're the first one there in a cave, you have no idea what's around the next corner,"" he added.Stanton's passion is more like an obsession, and he has dedicated his life to it. He never married, and his house in England, cluttered with home-made diving equipment, once led a Sunday Telegraph journalist to describe him as ""not the most domesticated of men.""Whilst he wouldn't describe cave diving as a competitive activity, he concedes that ""it is a very competitive environment, people always want to be the first ones there."" It's a pursuit that has claimed the lives of many, some of whom who were known to Stanton, and he's often recovered their bodies. But he doesn't consider diving to be inherently risky.""Just because something seems dangerous doesn't mean that you have to do it in a dangerous manner,"" he said. ""Driving [a car] could be dangerous if you're a dangerous driver."" And he's in no way a thrill seeker. ""If you've got adrenaline in a cave, you're doing it wrong,"" he added. He has dived all over the world, often going further and deeper than any before him. And he's done it his own way, eschewing the flashy high-tech gadgets used by some of his rivals. His signature piece of equipment -- a flotation device -- is actually a repurposed inner tube from a motorcycle tire. If that gives the impression of a beginner, he is anything but. The rescue team pictured carrying a member of the team on a stretcher.'Complete chaos'By the time Stanton and his dive partner Jonathan Volanthen arrived at the Tham Luang Cave in Northern Thailand on June 27, he assumed the 12 boys and their coach would be dead -- they'd already been missing for four days. It was another five before he surfaced in a chamber deep in the cave and recoiled at the pungent air. ""They must be dead, we've found their bodies,"" he wrote in his autobiography 'Aquanaut,' but then they heard the voices. A moment of relief and elation was quickly followed by greater concern. ""The worst bit was after we found them,"" Stanton recalled to CNN. ""We had no idea how we were going to get them out.""   Boys rescued from Thai cave play friendly at World Cup stadiumStanton says that he's dived in more difficult caves, but this particular experience was complicated by what he discovered when planning the rescue strategy. The caves were no longer in a natural state, instead they were with filled with electrical cables, pipes and diesel fuel that was leaking from the pumps. As he maneuvered through the dark and tiny nooks and crannies of a flooded cave network, he describes a scene of ""complete chaos."" On their second day in the cave, Stanton and Volanthen had to save four pump workers who'd become isolated from their crew and trapped. Nobody even seemed to know that they were missing. It was a fraught evacuation, the men were only underwater for about 40 seconds at a time, but Stanton said they all were terrified. ""We manhandled them, put regulators in their mouths and dived only short distances, but they all pretty much panicked. I describe it as an underwater wrestling match.""At the time, the impromptu rescue was an unnecessary distraction, and it further delayed locating the boys, but it was an experience that ultimately helped get them all out alive. READ: Boys rescued from Thai cave welcomed by Manchester UnitedMembers of the 'Wild Boars' team pose to promote a Netflix series about the rescue of the team.'I'm not declaring it a miracle'As all of this was unfolding, Stanton had unwittingly become one of the main actors on the stage of a global drama. Every day, the ""stony faced Brits"" walked into the cave past the hundreds of news reporters and the stoic mothers of the missing boys. He says he's good at wearing blinkers -- he was able to cut out all of the noise -- but admits that would have been difficult if he'd been made truly aware that millions of people had become emotionally invested, all around the world. When asked why he thinks so many people cared so much, he describes the Thai cave rescue as ""the ultimate reality show."" ""As morbid as it might be, it was the uncertainty,"" he explained.Thai boys recall battle to survive cave ordeal -- and moment they were foundNobody could be sure of a happy ending to the story, not even Stanton, who had concluded that the only way to save the boys was to sedate them. It was an extraordinary gamble, inspired by their experience with the stranded pump workers, but as the monsoon rains intensified, it was ""the best of all the worst options.""Another cave diver, the Australian anesthetist Dr. Richard Harris, strongly disagreed with the idea. That was until he had dived in to see the predicament they were in. ""There was no scientific knowledge of anyone being sedated underwater,"" Stanton said. ""If you sedate anyone in the hospital, they are completely monitored and intubated and have resuscitation teams all around them."" In the National Geographic documentary film, 'The Rescue,' Dr. Harris says he felt like he was ""euthanizing"" the boys in the cave, and it was only then that the enormity of it all finally hit Stanton. ""We made the plan dispassionately, but that doesn't prepare you for the time when you sedate a boy, make them unconscious, put a mask on them, tie them up and drag them underwater. ""You're the only person cradling that boy for two and a half hours. That's when the responsibility of what you're doing really hit home."" Stanton and his team were prepared for multiple deaths, they simply didn't believe it would be possible to make 13 successful trips. But he was wrong, after three days of intense diving, the boys and their coach had all been successfully evacuated.How close was it to all going wrong? ""It's hard to say,"" Stanton chuckled. ""Because it did all go right. Thirteen consecutive positive results have some statistical relevance."" Was it a miracle? ""I'll stretch it to say that it was miraculous that all these things happened sequentially. It was a collaboration between thousands of people, it was exceptional planning,"" he said. ""It was miraculous that everything happened but I'm not declaring it a miracle.""   READ: Thai cave rescue boys sign Netflix deal for miniseriesJUST WATCHEDRescued Thai boys play soccer in ArgentinaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRescued Thai boys play soccer in Argentina 00:43Teamwork saved themBefore the Thai cave rescue, Stanton was wondering what to do with the rest of his life and also questioning what he'd been doing with his life. He'd retired as a firefighter and had become disillusioned with diving. Writing in 'Aquanaut,' he lamented: ""I'd devoted my life to reaching the pinnacle in this one activity that was absolutely pointless, it brought nothing to anybody."" But then the Wild Boars youth team entered the cave, and the rest is history. He says doesn't believe in fate, but concedes it would be hard to argue against the existence of destiny in his own narrative arc. ""It does appear that everything I have done has led in incremental steps to this,"" he said. In saving all those lives in the cave, his own life has been transformed. He's now a guest speaker in high demand, a published author and he'll soon be portrayed by the American actor Viggo Mortensen in the Ron Howard movie, 'Thirteen Lives.' Remarkably, some of the boys still go into the cave for fun, but he doesn't see much of them anymore -- the language barrier makes it difficult to develop any kind of meaningful relationship. But he knows they are grateful, the smiles on their faces when he saw them six months after the rescue told him all that he needed to know. ""They don't need to say it in words,"" he said.  And while he still doesn't consider himself to be a football fan, he does now have some appreciation for the game. ""They were a team before the rescue, during and afterwards,"" he concludes. ""And I think that played a very big part in their own survival.""We were dreading that they might challenge us to a game, because we would lose by a huge number of goals. It would be hugely embarrassing!"""
